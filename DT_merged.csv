"1",1,"Trump Rally In Novi, Michigan","https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-rally-in-novi-michigan","Donald Trump (00:00):

… again. America will always rise to every challenge and overcome every danger.

Matthew Whitaker (00:08):

Donald Trump seems to always get stronger when challenged. These types of things, I think, give him strength.

Donald Trump (00:16):

When I’m re-elected, I will totally obliterate the deep state. As long as we have pride in our beliefs, courage in our convictions, and faith in our God, then we will not fail.

MUSIC (00:51):

This is a man’s world.
(00:51)
This is a man’s world.
(00:51)
But it wouldn’t be nothing, nothing, nothing.
(00:51)
Without a woman or a girl.
(00:52)
You see, man made the car.
(00:54)
To take us over the road.
(01:27)
Man made the train.
(01:27)
To carry the heavy load.
(01:27)
Man made the electric lights.
(01:27)
To take us out of the dark.
(01:27)
And man made the boat for the water.
(01:27)
Like my Bible said, Noah made the ark.
(01:27)
This is a man’s world.
(01:27)
But it wouldn’t be nothing, nothing, nothing.
(01:27)
Without a woman or a girl.
(01:27)
[Italian 00:02:16].
(01:27)
Man thinks about a little bitty baby girl.
(01:27)
And a baby boy. Man make them happy because man make them toys.
(03:27)
And after man made everything he can.
(03:27)
Man made the lira, pesos, dollars, rupees.
(03:27)
To buy for every good woman and every man.
(03:27)
This is a man’s world.
(03:27)
[Italian 00:03:49].
(03:27)
But it wouldn’t be nothing.
(03:27)
Without a woman or a girl.
(03:27)
[Italian 00:04:02].
(03:27)
He’s lost-
(03:27)
A man’s world.
(03:27)
… in the wilderness.
(03:27)
It’s a man’s world.
(03:27)
He’s lost-
(03:27)
[Italian 00:04:18].
(03:27)
… in bitterness.
(03:27)
[Italian 00:04:21].
(03:27)
This is a man’s world.
(03:27)
Please, please, please, please.
(03:27)
Please, please don’t go.
(03:27)
Please, please, please.
(03:27)

(04:50)
You know you done me wrong.
(06:09)
Whoa, whoa, you done me wrong.
(06:09)
You know you done me wrong.
(07:27)
Know you done, done me wrong. Oh.
(12:36)
Whoa, oh yeah, oh you took my love.
(12:36)
And now you’re gone.
(12:36)
Please, please don’t go.
(12:36)
Please, please, please, please, please, please.
(12:36)
Please, please don’t go.
(12:36)

(12:36)
Please, please don’t go.
(12:36)
Darling, please, don’t go.
(12:36)
Oh, oh yeah, girl.
(12:36)
I love you so.
(12:36)
Please, please don’t go.
(12:36)
I just want to hear you say I, I, I, I.
(12:36)
Please, please don’t go.
(12:36)
I, I, I, I, I.
(12:36)
Please, please don’t go.
(12:36)
Darling, please don’t go.
(12:36)
Oh, oh yeah, girl.
(12:36)

(12:36)
Please, please don’t go.
(12:36)
Baby, take my hand.
(12:36)
Please, please don’t go.
(12:36)
I want to be your lover man.
(12:36)
Baby, please don’t go.
(12:36)
Oh yes, good God almighty.
(12:36)
Darling, please don’t go.
(12:36)
Yeah, oh yeah, girl.
(12:40)
I love you so.
(12:40)
Baby, please don’t go.
(12:40)
Please don’t go.
(12:40)
Please, please don’t go.
(12:40)
Please don’t go.
(12:40)
Please, please don’t go.
(12:40)
Darling, please don’t go.
(12:40)
Girl, I love you so.
(12:40)
Please, please don’t go.
(12:40)
Please, please.
(12:40)
It’s been seven hours and 15 days.
(12:40)
Since you took your love away.
(12:40)
I go out every night and sleep all day.
(12:40)
Since you took your love away.
(12:40)
Since you been gone I can do whatever I want.
(12:40)
I can see whomever I choose.
(12:40)
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant.
(12:40)
But nothing.
(12:40)
I said nothing can take away these blues.
(12:40)
‘Cause nothing compares.
(12:40)
Nothing compares to you.
(12:40)
It’s been so lonely without you here.
(12:40)
Like a bird without a song.
(12:40)
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling.
(12:40)
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong?
(12:40)
I could put my arms around every boy I see.
(12:40)
But they’d only remind me of you.
(12:40)
I went to the doctor.
(12:40)
And guess what he told me, guess what he told me?
(12:40)
He said, “Girl, you better try to have fun.”
(12:40)
“No matter what you do,” but he’s a fool.
(12:40)
‘Cause nothing compares.
(12:40)
Nothing compares to you.
(12:40)
All the flowers that you planted, Mama, in the backyard.
(12:40)
All died when you went away.
(12:40)
I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard.
(12:40)
But I’m willing to give it another try.
(12:40)
Nothing compares.
(12:40)
Nothing compares to you.
(12:40)
Nothing compares.
(12:40)
Nothing compares to you.
(12:40)
Nothing compares.
(12:40)
Nothing compares to you.
(12:40)
Ever since I was a young boy, I’ve played the silver ball.
(12:40)
From Soho down to Brighton, I must’ve played them all.
(12:40)
But I ain’t seen nothing like him in any amusement hall.
(12:55)
That deaf, dumb, blind kid sure plays a mean pinball.
(12:55)
He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine.
(12:55)
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean.
(12:55)
Plays by intuition, the digit counters fall. That deaf, dumb, blind kid sure plays a mean pinball.
(13:39)
He’s a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist.
(13:39)
A pinball wizard’s got such a supple wrist.
(13:41)
How do you think he does it?
(13:52)
I don’t know!
(13:52)
What makes him so good?
(13:52)
Ain’t got no distractions, can’t hear no buzzes and bells.
(13:56)
Don’t see no lights a-flashing, plays by sense of smell. Always gets the replay, never seen him fall.
(14:04)
That deaf, dumb, blind kid sure plays a mean pinball.
(14:26)
I thought I was the Bally table king.
(14:47)
But I just handed my pinball crown to him.
(14:47)
Even on my favorite table, he can beat my best.
(14:47)
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest.
(14:51)
He’s got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall.
(14:54)
That deaf, dumb, blind kid sure plays a mean pinball.
(15:07)
Young man, there’s no need to feel down.
(15:40)
I said young man, pick yourself off the ground.
(15:40)

(15:48)
There’s no need to be unhappy.
(15:52)
Young man, there’s a place you can go.
(15:56)
I said young man, when you’re short on your dough.
(15:59)
You can stay there, and I’m sure you will find.
(15:59)
Many ways to have a good time.
(15:59)

(15:59)
Young man, are you listening to me?
(15:59)
I said young man, what do you want to be?
(15:59)
I said young man, you can make real your dreams.
(16:52)
But you’ve got to know this one thing.
(16:52)
No man does it all by himself.
(16:52)
I said young man, put your pride on the shelf.
(16:52)
And just go there to the Y.M.C.A.
(16:52)
I’m sure they can help you today.
(16:52)

You can do whatever you feel.
(19:14)
Young man, I was once in your shoes.
(19:14)
I said I was down and out with the blues.
(19:27)
I felt no man cared if I were alive.
(19:29)
I felt the whole world was so jive.
(19:29)
That’s when someone came up to me.
(19:29)
And said, “Young man, take a walk up the street.”
(19:29)
“It’s a place there called the Y.M.C.A.”
(19:29)
“They can start you back on your way.”
(19:29)
It’s fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

It’s fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

Y.M.C.A., it’s fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
(19:29)
Young man, young man, there’s no need to feel down.
(19:29)
Young man, young man, get yourself off the ground.
(19:29)
Y.M.C.A., it’s fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
(19:29)
Young man, young man, are you listening to me?
(19:29)
Young man, young man, what do you wanna be?
(19:29)
Y.M.C.A., you’ll find it at the Y.M.C.A.
(19:29)
No man, no man does it all by himself.
(19:29)
Young man, young man, put your pride on the shelf.
(19:29)
Y.M.C.A., and just go to the Y.M.C.A.
(19:29)
Young man, young man, I was once in your shoes.
(19:29)
Young man, young man, I was down with the blues.
(19:29)
Y.M.C.A.

Donald Trump (19:55):

When I first came into office, I cut taxes more than any other president. We have created seven million new jobs, and it led to a growth like we’ve never seen before. We developed the greatest economy in history by far. When I left office, it changed. Inflation destroyed the lives of so many people. Interest rates went from 2% to 10%. Millions of illegal immigrants, traffickers, and drugs coming into our country. Our country has gone to hell. So, I made a decision to run. We’re going to make America great again, greater than ever before. I will fight for you with every breath, and I will never let you down.

MUSIC (20:45):

I’ma gonna fight like a jeep, they all gon’ see.
(20:52)
And if I die I’m gonna die free.

Dana White (20:52):

President Trump is literally putting his life on the line, and he’s willing to risk it all, because he loves this country.

Lara Trump (21:00):

He is strong, he is fearless, and he is what this country needs right now.

Eric Trump (21:07):

Our cities will be safe, our streets will be clean, and our border will be secure.

MUSIC (21:11):

Never quit.

Tulsi Gabbard (21:14):

We can’t allow our country to be destroyed by politicians who will put their own power ahead of the interests of the American people, our freedom, and our future.

Amber Rose (21:22):

The left told me to hate Trump. When you cut through the lies, you realize the truth: American families were better when Donald Trump was president. We were safer, wealthier, and stronger.

Donald Trump Jr. (21:35):

So, if you love this country-

Crowd (21:36):

USA! USA! USA! USA!

Donald Trump Jr. (21:36):

… if you want to stand up and fight for the future of our nation, you must re-elect Donald J. Trump.

MUSIC (21:43):

Tell everyone.
(21:43)
I’ll never quit.

Announcer (21:54):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next president of the United States, President Donald J. Trump.

MUSIC (22:04):

And I’m proud to be an American.
(22:04)
Where at least I know I’m free.
(22:05)
And I won’t forget the men who died.
(22:05)
Who gave that right to me.
(22:05)
And I’d gladly stand up next to you.
(22:05)
And defend her still today.
(22:05)
‘Cause there ain’t no doubt.
(22:05)
I love this land.
(22:05)
God bless the USA.
(22:05)
From the lakes of Minnesota.
(22:46)
To the hills of Tennessee.
(22:50)
Across the plains of Texas.
(22:53)
From sea to shining sea.
(22:56)
From Detroit down to Houston. And New York to L.A.
(23:03)
Where there’s pride in every American heart.
(23:06)
And it’s time we stand and say.
(23:29)
That I’m proud to be an American.
(23:29)
Where at least I know I’m free.
(23:29)
And I won’t forget the men who died.
(23:29)
Who gave that right to me.
(23:29)
And I’d gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today.
(23:36)
‘Cause there ain’t no doubt.
(23:45)
I love this land.
(23:45)
God bless the USA.
(23:45)
And I’m proud to be an American. Where at least I know I’m free.
(24:00)
And I won’t forget the men who died.
(24:01)
Who gave that right to me.
(24:02)
And I’d gladly stand up next to you.
(24:02)
And defend her still today.
(24:08)
‘Cause there ain’t no doubt.
(24:10)
I love this land.
(24:10)
God bless the USA.

Donald Trump (24:27):

Wow, thank you very much.

Crowd (24:27):

USA! USA!

Donald Trump (24:27):

Thank you.

Crowd (24:27):

USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!

Donald Trump (24:27):

Thank you very much.

Crowd (24:27):

USA! USA! USA! USA!

Donald Trump (24:44):

Thank you very much, and a very big hello to Michigan, which we’re leading, by the way, by a lot. And I’m thrilled to be back in this incredible state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots, which is what you are. Last night, my opponent had one of these, and they bussed in people. But you know they got Beyoncé, and you know Beyoncé. They got Beyoncé. So, Beyoncé went up, spoke for a couple of minutes, and then left. And the place went crazy. They booed the hell out of everybody. They thought she was going to perform. Now, I would have no interest in that, but they said… And what happened is my opponent got up and started speaking, they booed the hell out of her. It’s crazy. So, they have to use people to get people to come, and then they send buses. We don’t send buses. Everybody comes. We’re just going to make America great again. It’s very simple. I thought I’d tell you that little story, because you’ll never hear it from the fake news. They don’t talk about it.

Crowd (25:53):

Boo!

Donald Trump (25:57):

They wouldn’t tell you stories like that. So, I’d like to begin by asking a very simple question. Are you better off now than you were four years ago? I think so?

Crowd (26:07):

No!

Donald Trump (26:08):

I think so. I doubt it. I doubt it. I’m here today with a message of hope for all Americans. With your vote in this election, we will end inflation. And you know what? It’s we, not me. We will stop the invasion of criminals into our country. And I will bring back the American Dream for your children and for yourself. This is all you need to know. Kamala broke it, I will fix it. It’s going to be very, very interesting. We’ll fix it.
(26:57)
I’ve been watching what’s happening. You do know she’s doing really badly, right? She can’t speak. There’s something wrong with her. We went through four years of that. We can’t go through four more years of that. With your support on November 5th, America will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer, and much stronger than ever before. This election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of gross incompetence and failure, or whether we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country. Pretty good.
(27:45)
And just so you know, this is it, because we’re not going to be able to save it much… This is it. We’ve gone as low as we’re going to go. We have to be able to save it. Any longer, you’re not going to be able to save it, it’s going to be gone. And we’re not going to let that happen to this country. I’m asking you to be excited about the future of our country. I’m asking you to dream big again for you and your family, your children. This is going to be America’s new golden age, you watch, we’re going to bring back… We’re going to bring back those car companies to Michigan. They’re going to come into Detroit. I’ve been hearing about promises for 40 years on Detroit, we’re going to make the promise. You’re going to have those car companies come roaring back. Through intelligent uses of tariffs, taxes, and incentives, they’re all coming back. They don’t come back, they’re not going to be selling any cars in this country, let me tell you right now.
(28:43)
And I just did, I have to tell you, I just did something very big for Detroit and for Michigan in particular, in particular. I killed the massive plants that were going to be built in Mexico. They’re dead. They’re all dead. And they were going to drive out all your damn business. They were going to take every one of your… They were building the biggest plants in the world in Mexico. And do you know who owned them? China. And they were going to flood our country with cars from just across the border. And I killed them. You know why I killed them? Because I said, “We’re not going to have it.” I’m going to win, and I’m going to put tariffs on those cars, and those cars will never be able to pay the tariff, because it would be too high. And they gave up on the project. They’re not going to build the project. How good is that? And I’m not even in office. How about that? But we will be soon. So, if I can do that out of office, think about what the hell I can do in office, right?
(29:58)
And I’ll tell you what, these are the

Donald Trump (30:00):

… the biggest plants in the world. The one of them is the biggest plant in the world by far. I think there’s more business than your whole state would do with the autos. It’s one of those thing, and what I did is I said, there’s no car coming in because they were going to just flood the whole nation. It would affect other states too, but I think of Michigan and I think of Detroit, it was going to end it. You’ve already lost 70% probably from the heyday. It’s dead and we’re going to now build it up. You’re going to be bigger and better with the industry than you’ve ever been even in your heyday.
(30:49)
I got a lot of friends here. I know half the people. Your future senator, I hope. Mike, you got to win this thing. He’s going to win. He’s going to win. Every problem facing us can be solved, but now the fate of our nation is truly in your hands, Michigan. You have to stand up and you have to tell Kamala Harris, the worst vice president in the history of our country. He’s the worst president and she’s the worst vice president. They stole the election from this guy. They stole it. They said, “You’re out, Joe. You’re out.” Crazy Nancy, Schumer, all of them. They went in. “You’re out of here, Joe. No, I won 14 million votes.” He got 14 million votes. Kamala got no votes and she took over. That’s a threat to democracy, right? To use that. But you’re going to tell Kamala Harris, and it’s going to start right here. If we win Michigan, the whole deal is over. You know that, right? It’s all over.
(32:08)
You’re going to say, “Kamala, you’re no good. You did a lousy job. You destroyed San Francisco. You destroyed California. You destroyed everything you touched. You’re not going to destroy our nation. Kamala Harris, you are fired. Get the hell out of here. Get out of here. You’re fired.”
(32:24)
All right. We got to get her the hell out. If she did to you what she did to San Francisco, you don’t want to have it. She destroys everything. Not a good person either. I see the ad she puts in. I don’t have to go into specifics. Anything I did, anything I say she puts ads in and we are mainstream. You know what we are? We’re common sense. She will put an ad in saying the exact opposite of what I believe and what I’ve been. And what I’ve been saying for 20 years, she’s changed 15 policies in order to be able to run. No transgender operations for people in detention upon will paid for by the government. She changed like men and women sports. She wants men to be able to participate in women’s sports.
(33:33)
No. She probably got rid of that. “Like no fracking. There will be no…” For her whole life, she’s no fracking. “No oil and gas. We don’t want oil and gas.” So really how are we going to get the cars to run? Well, we want to go a little bit further. How are we going to get them to run? All of these things. She’s changed everything over the last year and a half because you can’t get elected with that stuff unless you cheat, which is what they do, frankly. But you can’t get elected, so she’s changed every one of them.
(34:00)
Remember this. Nobody can change like that. If you change one policy… One thing with me, I’ve been consistent, I saw on a fake news show today I was watching. They said, “Well, one thing you have to say…” He’s been saying the same thing for 30 years, it’s true, they can’t steal your car business. They can’t take your jobs. You got to stop. It’s how I got into politics in the first place. But we’re going to bring all those plants back. We’re going to bring all those jobs back. And I’ve been saying that for her. She’s never said that,
(34:29)
But every single thing and if you have her… It’s not going to happen. I don’t believe it. Look, I’m not supposed to say this because you got to vote. If you don’t vote… Otherwise I’m not… We’re doing really well. We’re sort of way up, but I’m supposed to say it’s really tight, but you got to vote anyway. You got to vote. In fact, we have a chance of maybe doing something that nobody has ever done before politically in this country. At least not for a long time, but we have a chance. We win Michigan, we win the whole deal and we make America great again. You got to get out and vote.
(35:10)
Early in-person voting in Michigan is now open statewide and I’m asking for you to go to votetrump.com right after this rally ends and you’re going to see something, but just go. Let me ask you because you have the early vote. It used to be you have one day voting, paper ballots, voter identification. Today it’s illegal. How about this guy Gavin Newsom in California? He just signed a bill making it illegal to even ask a person for voter identification. They want to put you in jail.
(35:51)
That’s the next step. We’re going to get this whole thing straightened out. It’s crazy. You know what? Even the Democrats, it’s just the politicians, the Democrats. You go to the Democrats, you take a Democrat, they don’t want that. The people, the vote, they don’t want that. They want to have voter ID. They want to have proof of your country. In other words, are you a citizen of the country? It’ll be nice to have, right? But Gavin Newsom in California, they signed it. I didn’t even believe it. I thought it was like an April Fool’s.
(36:18)
I said, “Are we in April by any chance?” April Fool’s Day. He comes out with a bill that you are not allowed to ask a person whether or not they have voter ID. If you do it, you have broken the law. Can you believe it? So you’ll get arrested if you ask a person. This is where we’re going. It’s going to end and it’s going to end very quickly.
(36:44)
So as you probably have been reading, we’re setting records in the early vote in Michigan and in I think most of the other states, and you have until November 3rd to vote early. So you can do that. But the main thing is to go vote. You go vote if you want. How many people have voted so far? Okay. That’s good. How many people are going to vote?
(37:18)
So much for our early voting drive? Right? By the way, I love that because we’re already leading in the early vote, which is something no Republican has done in Michigan since they went to this ridiculous system. You know what the ridiculous system is? You have the rest of your life to vote. Anytime you want. Come on. The whole thing is… We used to have one day voting, voter ID, paper ballots, “Prove that you’re a citizen of the United States, please.” And you know what? You’d had no problems.
(37:56)
9:00, 9:30, you announced a… If somebody’s unhappy and somebody’s not, but there’s no stuff going up to the sky back, forth, it would cost 8%. This is not the most important thing, but it’s important. Paper ballots would cost 8% of what the machines cost. And paper ballots… How about these machines? They have the machines and they said, “We won’t be able to give you a vote for six days on election night. We won’t be able to give you a vote for six days with paper ballots.” 10:00 in the evening, they announce there’s bad stuff going on.
(38:38)
Why are we paying 10 times the cost for something that doesn’t give you the vote for a long time? You see all the time they have states that say, “We’ll need a few more days with paper ballots.” France went to it. They had mail-in voting, they had all this stuff and it was really working badly. It was corrupt. And they went to paper ballots, voter ID, same day voting. They have one day. They had 39 million votes at the end. They had a winner. They had loser, and that was it. Everybody went home. It’s crazy. And we’re going to get it back.
(39:12)
With your help 10 days from now, but there’s a big lobby against it. A lot of money. A lot of money made with all of the contraptions that they have. A lot of money. A lot of money. Not so much money made with paper. The paper is very sophisticated. It’s called watermark. It’s very sophisticated actually. It really prevents you from cheating. With your help, 10 days from now, we are going to win Michigan. We are going to defeat Kamala Harris and we are going to make America great again and we are going to make Detroit great again finally, after 45 years.
(39:46)
We’re going to make Detroit. I took a lot of heat because I was up here at the economic club. That’s what I was telling you about these massive factories in Mexico owned by China with massive factories. And I was here and I wasn’t that positive. I mean, they want me to say, “Oh, Detroit is great. Oh, it’s so great.” It needs help. So I said, “It needs help.” And people said, “Oh, he wasn’t positive.” I can’t be positive. I’ll be positive. Within two years I’ll be positive. You’ll see what positive is. But how the hell can you be positive? No, but that was where I called the gentleman and I see him sitting there, the man who builds most of the auto plants. He’s the biggest in the world I guess, and I told him I wanted to see a plant a year and a half ago. He said, “Okay, but I’ll have to take you to Mexico.” I said, “I don’t want to go to Mexico. I want to see one here.” He said, “We don’t build the big ones here.” Basically you have a stupid head of the union. This guy is stupid. And you know what? We are leading with the rank and file of the UAW. You know that. We’re leading by a lot because I’m going to bring your jobs back and I’m going to end the electric mandate, all-electric mandate on day one, which is going to cause you all of you to lose your job.
(41:17)
You’re going to build electric cars and you’re going to build all kinds of cars except hydrogen. There will be no hydrogen cars. They tend to blow up. And once they blow up, you are not recognizable anymore. No, they say that’s the hottest new thing, hydrogen. Does anybody in the… They say it’s so hot. The problem is when it’s not, when it’s not hot, it’s bad. It’s bad. So I don’t want to do that. They say for the most part, for the most part it’s really wonderful, but when it goes bad, it’s over. You’re not recognizable. They call the wife. “Please come and inspect to see whether or not this is your husband. He’s lying against a tree and the tree has a lot of red on it.” So we’re not going to do hydrogen cars. Is that okay for everybody? Right?
(42:14)
These guys told me, “We’re working on the solution. Forget it.” We got enough. For generations, this state was the world capital of automotive production and one of the great manufacturing centers in all of history. You were the best. You were the best. But then a lot of bad things started happening 40 years ago actually. But your politicians have done nothing. They were either stupid or corrupt, one or the other. They were both. But year after year, globalist politicians like Kamala Harris sold you out and let other countries loot and pillage and plunder your wealth and our jobs and our American dreams.
(42:53)
40% of Michigan auto jobs were annihilated after NAFTA. The worst trade deal ever made.And I ended it. I ended it with the USMCA, that’s Mexico and Canada. So much better. And then they allowed China in one of their brilliant moves to enter as a growing developing nation. If you’re a developing nation, you get all sorts of incentives like things that we have to do that they don’t including pay a lot of money. So China entered as a developing nation. Well, I think Detroit and some of our areas makes us a developing nation. China doesn’t have any place like that, but they allowed them into the World Trade Organization. That did not work out too well for us let me tell you because they robbed us and ripped us.
(43:45)
And I don’t blame them. If they get away with it, but they didn’t get away with it. I charged them more tariffs than China has paid in a thousand years. They paid hundreds of billions of dollars in… They paid 440 billion or so. You know how much your other previous presidents have gotten from China? Nothing. Zero. Not 10 cents. Not even 10 cents. The press challenged me. No, no. I think president so-and-so… I don’t want to get into it. Oh, Obama did a horrible job. I mean, he got ripped. They said he’d come. He’d make a speech. By the way, I don’t happen to think he’s a good speaker. I don’t happen to think he’s a good speaker, but he’d come, he’d make a speech and he’d leave.
(44:37)
They say other presidents came. They made a speech and they left. They say, “Trump, he came.” He looked at the books he says, “You people are being ripped off.” Then he might’ve made a quick speech and he said, “I’ll be back in two months.” And that’s what’s happening. You have been ripped off. This state has been ripped off. The car business is coming back to this state. And in a short period of time, you’re going to have more jobs than you had in its heyday. And it’s not even going to be hard.
(45:12)
Under Kamala, I don’t usually use the word Harris, because nobody knows who is Harris. They go, “Harris?” People say, “Who the hell is Harris?” You ever notice that, Mr. Congressman. Got all the genius congressmen over there. They’re very good. We only let the good ones come. We have plenty of that. We don’t like too much. But when I say Harris, Harris has done a terrible job. Harris is grossly. Nobody knows who the hell. Right? It’s true. Isn’t it crazy? Harris? Who the hell is Harris?
(45:44)
Under Kamala, the US has lost nearly 50,000 manufacturing jobs this year alone. You didn’t know that because the fake news… Whoa, you got a lot of fake news. You got a lot of bad ones back there too. Whoa. That’s a lot of fakers. You’d think they’d want their credibility back. When we show clips, they never showed. A friend of mine called up two weeks ago. He said, “I love your rallies, but I’d love to see…” We do some really pretty good clips that are good up there, beautiful screen.
(46:24)
So you take a look up there, take a look up there. No. So all they have to do is take the camera, go like this, two inches over, one inch. And the people at home can see it, right? And the people then at home can see it, but they don’t want to do it. They don’t want to do it. Now you’ll watch. No friends call it, they say, “I love your speeches,” but when they’re playing the tapes, they never show it.
(47:02)
All they have to do is turn the camera about an inch, two inches over, one inch up. It goes like this… And they could see it, but they don’t want to do that because they don’t want to see it. They don’t want to have people see it. US car sales are down 38% since I left office. Good job. Good job, Joe. You sleepy guy. I almost said something bad that would’ve… Oh, I was so close. I was so close. But I think of Franklin Graham. Franklin graham is a great guy. Does a great job with all of these horrible hurricanes and tornadoes and everything.
(47:42)
He wrote me a beautiful letter. He said, “President, I love your stories. You speak so well. I love it. It’s so great. But sir, it would be even better if you didn’t use foul language.” And I felt so guilty. I felt like, “Oh, that’s a kill.” That was in the last paragraph. He’s telling me how great, then he said, “Foul language.” And I gave it a shot. You lose a lot of emphasis and it’s not real bad stuff, but you do. I said, “Franklin, I think you’re wrong. And I do it sometimes that way. I haven’t been able to get quite the same emphasis, but I feel better about myself. I almost blew it right there, almost. Would’ve been much better if I did, but that I would’ve had a report to a higher authority.
(48:34)
But with victory in November, we are going to take back what is ours standing before you today. I am proclaiming that by the end of my term, the entire world will be talking about the Michigan miracle and the stunning rebirth of Detroit. We’ll bring back the auto industry greater than it has ever been. I’m not saying a little bit. We’re going to bring them back. And if they don’t want to build their plant here, you know what they’re going to do? They’re not going to sell cars here. China will not be building those massive plants in Mexico. Vote Trump, and you will see a mass exodus of manufacturing jobs from Mexico to Michigan, from Shanghai to Sterling Heights, and from Beijing to Detroit.
(49:35)
Starting in January, we will give our companies the lowest taxes, the lowest energy cost. We have more liquid gold than anybody. We were energy independent. Four years ago we were energy independent. We’re going to give them the lowest regulatory burdens, free access to the best and biggest market on the planet. But you know what? If we’re not smart, we’re not going to have the biggest and best.
(50:02)
We’re going to be like Venezuela, like all these other countries that went radical, left socialist, communist. We’ll be just like them. The centerpiece of this plan will be a 15% made in America corporate tax rate, cutting the tax from 21. So if you remember, I cut… And everyone said it was impossible. I cut it from almost 40% to 21%. So now it’s 21. Got it approved by Congress if you can believe it. And those people helped me right over there. But we cut it from almost 40 to 21.
(50:40)
And that made us very competitive with other countries because we’re competing against all these other countries and we can say, “Let’s make it 70%.” That’s okay, but everybody leaves and you have no jobs and you have a dead country. Because we have to compete against Japan and against China, and against South Korea. We have to compete. But now what I’m doing is I’m taking it from 21 to 15%, but only for those who make their product here in the USA and hire American workers for the job.
(51:18)
They’re going to see something. They’re going to come floating back when they say, “Gee, we’re not allowed to sell cars in the United States anymore.” It’s that question of allowed. They’re going to have to pay a big price for them to rip off our companies, steal our jobs and sell things. If they want to partake in this market, we’re going to make it the greatest market in the world. Then they’re going to have to pay a price. And the price is either a stiff tariff or you don’t have to pay the tariff.
(51:50)
You’ll build the plant in the United States and you people are going to run that. And if these companies don’t make their cars and products here, then they will pay that tariff. And when they send their product into the United States for the privilege of competing with our workers and our cherished, and now protected factories. They’re going to be cherished and protected companies.
(52:18)
We’re going to protect those companies. We’re not going to let those companies be underbid and all of the things that they do to destroy them, and then they come in and they have the prices twice as high. Not going to let that happen. And we have an advantage over because other countries do that, but we have an advantage because we have the best market. We will also pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act. You know what that is? That means that if China or any other country, and there are many of them, most of them charge us a 100 or 200% tax. Then we will charge them likewise, a 100 or 200% tax [inaudible 00:52:58].
(52:58)
It’s called an eye for an eye. And you’ll see them drop those numbers against you. You’ll see everything start to work like it should. These pro worker policies are among the many reasons why I’ve been overwhelmingly endorsed by the rank and file membership of the Teamsters. We have Teamsters here and it’s one of the reasons that we have incredible support from the workers at the UAW. They’re very smart. They’re very smart. They don’t want to make all electric cars because they know all electric cars within two, three years are going to all be made in China. They’re going to all be made in China. And they’re great. They’re great. And we love Elon Musk. There’s nobody like Elon Musk. But he understands this. You got to have choice. You want choice for schools actually, and you want choice here, and you want choice in the military. If you can’t get a doctor, we call that choice too. We did that too. We did a lot. But I just saw a man in the audience who’s incredible, and he was so proactive for Trump. And he’s AUW members, Brian Pannebecker.
(54:23)
And Brian, if he’s around, I want to get him up here for a second. Where’s Brian? Come here, Brian. Show me these arms. Look at the arms of this guy. Look at the arms of this guy.

Brian Pannebecker (54:43):

Thank you, Mr. President.

Donald Trump (54:45):

I saw you out there.

Brian Pannebecker (54:45):

Thank you, Mr. President. Listen, I met Donald Trump, I told you in the pre-program eight years ago in this very building. I said, if you come to Macomb County and ask for the auto workers support and you get it, you might win Macomb County big enough to carry the whole state. Guess what? That’s exactly what we did. Now, listen, I’ve got about 150 co-workers here with me. You see them in my red T-shirts. Make some noise, guys. We got 10 days left and I’m not here to try and convince you who to vote for because we know who everybody in this room is voting for. What I am here to do is to send you out of here, to go home and talk to 10 of your friends, neighbors, co-workers and family members, and make sure every single one of them vote because our industry, the automotive industry is on the line. And it’s not going to die on my watch when we got this man running for president.

Donald Trump (55:59):

Thank you, Brian. Look at the arms on that guy. Boy, oh boy. Do all auto workers have arms like that? You see, he just grabbed me and I think I need a doctor. Thank you, Brian. Great job. That’s great. Well, he means it. It’s from the heart. Brian doesn’t work for me. I don’t know Brian, other than I know that we have the same thing. We want to see the auto industry not leave this state and this country. We want it in the country. And if they choose other than Michigan, we can live with that, but they got to be in the United States, but I think they’re going to choose Michigan.
(56:37)
You have a lot of assets like the center location, et cetera, et cetera. So I want to thank you, Brian. You’re really a patriot. Amazing, amazing guy, and those auto workers listen to him too. They listen to him. They get it. They get it. You have a union head that doesn’t get it, but I’m sure he is a decent guy, but he doesn’t get it. We want these companies coming back to this state and ideally I’d love to see him. Look, I’ve got to be equal to every… I’d love to see them come into Detroit though. I’d love to see them.
(57:10)
You have so many assets and we’re going to work on it. That’s what we’re going to do. We are going to make it a miracle. We’re going to make the state a miracle and we’re going to make Detroit a miracle and it’s going to happen and it’s guaranteed. It’s guaranteed. If Kamala gets four more years, she will obliterate our economy, kill millions of jobs, and destroy your family’s finances. She’ll also kill thousands of people. Her border policy is so bad. Open borders, anybody can come in. What she’s done to our country at the border is horrible.
(57:46)
What she’s done to us…. I say inflation is rated number two. The economy, which I think is basically a part of inflation is rated number one in terms of the most important thing that people vote for. Number three is the border. I disagree. I think the border is actually number one, and the inflation is horrible, right? Because they’re allowing murderers and drug lords and prisoners. They’re emptying their prisons and I think it’s number one. But her inflation nightmare has already cost the typical family over $30,000 in higher prices.
(58:23)
And now she wants to raise the typical family’s taxes by nearly $3,000 a year. Think of that. Right? She’s called the taxing queen and she’s demanding a shocking 33% tax hike on all domestic production. You know what that’s going to do? That’s going to drive everybody into other countries because they’re all competing for our companies. We can’t do that. She’s a stupid person. We can’t do that. Take a look at this.

VIDEO (58:54):

Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax bill.
(58:58)
Calling for a full repeal of President Trump’s tax cuts.
(59:01)
If Kamala Harris was elected president, there are many different tax policies which could cripple the economy, but the first thing she wants to do is allow these Trump tax cuts to expire.
(59:10)
Even the New York Times admits that 85% of the middle class got a tax cut.
(59:15)
Americans will face a hike. The tax foundation finding that a couple with two kids making $165,000 a year would have to pay over $2,400 more in taxes.
(59:27)
And on day one, I will repeal that tax bill. Joe Biden and I are about to work to get rid of that tax cut. Joe and I are about to get rid of that tax bill. Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax cut.
(59:38)
Everything from a 70 to 80% tax rate.
(59:41)
I think that’s fantastic. We’ve got to increase the corporate tax rate. Part of that is going to be about repealing that tax bill that they just passed. And also looking at estate taxes are going to have to go up, we will tax capital gains. But we’re going to have to raise corporate taxes.
(59:55)
Taxing unrealized gains just doesn’t seem fair in any sense of the word.

VIDEO (01:00:00):

When the value of your home goes up, you pay higher taxes.

Speaker 1 (01:00:02):

It’s tiring.

VIDEO (01:00:02):

Even if you don’t sell your home.

VIDEO (01:00:03):

Your value of your home never moves the way the stock moves to say, “We’re going to tax what you don’t have.” That’s a sore point and it’s a big deal. Is that something you think she firmly believes in?

VIDEO (01:00:14):

I think it’s part of the proposals of the campaign.

Kamala Harris (01:00:16):

Under my plan there will also be a carbon fee. There has to be some connection between the fee and bad behaviors and there has to be … And we have to monitor whether it’s going to be passed on to consumers. But I’m going to tell you that should never be the reason not to actually put a fee, and particular carbon fee.

Donald Trump (01:00:42):

See now the camera didn’t show that. So for all of you at home, you’re going to have to come in and watch in person. Can you imagine? It’s so nasty. They’re so nasty. They’re so evil. They are actually the enemy of the people. They really are. So evil.
(01:01:03)
But you see this. How about a tax on an unrealized gain? Think of what that means. We are going to tax something you haven’t even taken. They’re going to put a tax on an unrealized gain. Think of this. That’s a new one. Even in the world that’s a new one. It’s called communism. I will massively cut taxes for workers and small business and we will have a few things that I think you’ll like. No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on social security. Those beautiful benefits for our seniors.
(01:01:43)
And as a Senator, Kamala voted to impose a 100% ban on gas-powered cars and trucks. Thank you Kamala. And she doesn’t know a thing about it. She doesn’t know a damn thing about it. She voted to … A 100% ban, which would kill an estimated 200,000 US auto jobs. Please tell the head of … Brian, tell the head of your union that please would you do? Can you imagine? She wants to ban gas-powered trucks, things. That’s just … There goes … Oh, it’s gone. Well, it’s not gone. It’s going to China. It’s all going to China. China will make them. Don’t worry. They make anything.
(01:02:25)
On day one of the Trump administration, I will terminate Kamala’s insane electric vehicle mandate and we will end immediately the green new scam once and for all. You know, Mr. Congressman, the green new scam … In her ideal … This was done by AOC. You know that right? AOC plus three I call it, because it’s like one person. She has absolutely no experience with the environment. Oh, have you studied? No, I haven’t. Have you taken a course? No. But she’s telling us about the environment. She has no idea. It’s the green new scam. In their ideal world, what they want is 93 trillion dollars. You know that, right? They want buildings in New York taken down and rebuilt without windows because a window is environmentally unfriendly. I guess the sun goes through and creates a little warm feel … Nice and warm. So beautiful. I want a window in my apartment. Oh, I want to see … You got some great salesmen in real estate. I want to see somebody sell somebody in an apartment without a window in it. Those would be seriously good salesmen. But no, these people are for real.
(01:03:44)
The cows are going to disappear. No more cows, no more anything. These people are crazy. So it’s 93 trillion. That’s more than China, the US and every other country has for 30 years. They’re nuts. We had the cleanest air for four years of any country by far. The cleanest water. That’s what I want. I want clean air, clean water, and jobs. I will make interest on car loans. Wait till you hear this, Michigan. I’m going to make interest on car loans. Nobody’s even thought about it but your favorite president, fully tax deductible. Nobody thought of that. But a there’s but. But. There’s a but. Don’t get too happy yet. But listen to how smart it is.
(01:04:45)
Look, it’s like the paperclip 129 years ago, a guy came up with an idea for the paperclip. Everybody then said, “Oh, I could have been rich if I only thought of it. Why?” This is the same thing. Make it fully deductible, but only for cars made in America. Because affording a car is a part of the American dream. Pretty good, right? What do you think about that, Issa? No, but think of that. Nobody thought of that. Number one, they didn’t think about making a deductible. You know what that’s going to do to the automobile business in Michigan? If I give deductibility on interest payments, that’s going to be … But now I say deductible … But then I said, “Well wait a minute. Supposing they buy a car made in Japan, what the hell good does that do us?” So I added a little caveat. But only if the car is made in the U.S, okay? Which will be here.
(01:05:44)
And I had a call from some of the smartest guys on Wall Street. 182 IQ stuff. Unlike Biden and Kamala. They’re low IQ individuals, very low. But I was talking to 182 guys. That’s about top of the pack. And they said, “Where the hell did you come up with that idea?” It’s so simple, right? And they loved the second part, but they never even had the first part. Nobody thought … Nobody told me about. It’s just an idea. Nobody told me. And then I said, “It’s so good. That’s going to cause car business in this country to boom.” And you can have the American dream. Because you don’t have the American dream without a car for your kids, et cetera, et cetera.
(01:06:27)
So we’re very proud of that. So there’s two things for you. Well, I think the overtime is great for all these guys. Friends of Brian’s. I think the overtime, no tax or overtime, we’ll quickly become energy independent as we were four years ago, and we will frack, frack, frack, and drill baby drill. And we’re going to cut your energy prices because people are all saying, “Oh, it’s too … ” They’ve already done the damage. They’ve done the damage at the border. They’re saying, “Oh, we’re trying to stop … ” Nothing there. In the meantime, there are plane’s flying overhead loaded up with illegal migrants. These people are bad. They’re sick.
(01:07:17)
I don’t even know … Normally you know why people are doing things even on the other side. Who the hell wants an open border? Who would want it? Unless you hate the country, you’re stupid, or you want those people to vote. It could be the third thing, but boy, that’s a big price. But I’m going to cut your energy prices in half within 12 months from January 20th when we take off. 50%. And that’s going to lower the cost of everything because we have to bring bacon and eggs and everything, we have to bring it down because they’re all record-breaking. They’ve already done the damage just like they’ve done the damage with all of the criminals they’ve allowed in. We have to get them out.
(01:08:06)
As we restore our economy, we will also secure our borders. Over the past four years, Kamala Harris has orchestrated the most egregious betrayal that any leader in American history has ever inflicted upon the people of the United States. It’s true. It’s true. It’s not even believable. The worst people in the world. I used this term yesterday for the first time. I just thought of it while I’m up here. I think of a lot of things when I’m up here that are on this stupid machine. Isn’t it nice to have a president that doesn’t need a frickin teleprompter, isn’t it? But I use this term. I always said we’re the dumping ground for the world. Yesterday I said, “We’re the garbage can for the world.” We are. We’re a garbage can. We’re like a garbage can and they dump their criminals, their people with tremendous mental problems from insane asylums, from mental institutions. Their drug dealers, their gang members. Their jail … Their prisoners, they’re going to open their jails. They’ve already done it, but they haven’t completed it.
(01:09:24)
I would’ve done it faster than them. I’ll be honest, if I ran one of those countries, one of the many countries, they come now, a lot of them coming in from the Congo in Africa. They open it up, they bring them to the southern border and they throw them into our country. They come from jails in the Congo, they come from jails from all over the world, the Middle East. A lot come from South America, but it’s not just South America. She’s eradicated our sovereign border and she’s unleashed an army of migrant gangs who are waging a campaign of violence and terror against our citizens all over our country. And you see it, all you have to do is pick up your paper. They said, “Oh, these are wonderful people. You are the American dream. It’s wonderful.” They didn’t know that they killed five people each. Kamala has imported an invasion of criminal migrants from prisons and jails, insane asylums and mental institutions. That’s pretty much the same thing. Insane asylum being a number of steps up. All from around the world, from Venezuela to the Congo, and she’s resettled them into a community near you. Oh, how lovely. All to pray. And this is what’s going to happen. And it’s happening. They’re praying on innocent Americans that did nothing wrong.
(01:10:45)
One of the deadliest and most vicious gangs anywhere in the world has been imported by her open border policies, which are ridiculous, into our country is the savage Venezuelan prison gang. These are lovely young people that met in prison, some for murder, some for other things. The name is Tren de Aragua and it’s taking over apartment complexes and unleashing a violent killing spree in Aurora, Ohio, in Aurora, Colorado, and it’s all over the country. It’s no longer just in Colorado or Ohio. How about Ohio, where you have in Springfield, they sent 32,000 illegal migrants into a 50,000 person community. You can’t get into a hospital. You can’t get into a school. This is what they’ve done to us.
(01:11:44)
But this one gang from Venezuela, probably the most vicious in the world, them in MS-13, the Border Patrol. Oh, by the way, border patrol endorsed me last week. Gave me the strongest endorsement. And in the endorsement they said, “She’s the absolute worst and you cannot let her become … “You ought to see their endorsement. I like the second part even better than the first. She’s the worst. But they’ve taken over. This gang has taken over Times Square in New York City. Let’s take a look.

Donald Trump (01:14:32):

Letting into our country. It’s not going to happen for long, let me tell you. It’s going to be the other way. The United States is now an occupied country, but it will soon be an occupied country no longer. November 5th, 2024 will be Liberation Day in America. And to expedite removals of Tren de Aragua and other savage gangs like MS-13, I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Think of that. We had to go back so far, so far. Because that’s when they ran a strong country. Had to go back a long way. 1798 to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil. Gives us total power to do it. And if they come back into our country, it’s an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole. And I’m hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer.
(01:15:51)
Kamala Harris is so incompetent and so unfit that she is obviously disqualified from being President of the United States. All you have to do is take a look at what she said the other night on CNN. They had a town hall, even Alison Cooper was embarrassed by it. He was embarrassed by it. She was terrible. I can’t be the president. Can you imagine her dealing with President Xi of China? Putin of Russia? I’m going to meet Putin today. She will destroy our country. Everyone knows it. No one respects her. No one trusts her. No one takes her seriously. From humiliating our country in Afghanistan, the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country to the war in Ukraine, that would’ve never happened if I was president to the nightmare on our border, to her inflation catastrophe, to her egregious hurricane response, the worst response since Katrina. Maybe worse than Katrina. North Carolina, all over the place. Those people, nobody even showed up. You know why? They spent all their money on illegal migrants. They don’t have any money in FEMA. Kamala Harris is a train wreck who has destroyed everything in her path. And by the way, October 7th in Israel would not have happened either. Those people that were slaughtered would not have happened. They’d be living today. They’d be home with their parents or with their families. Kamala is campaigning with Muslim-hating war monger Liz Cheney, who wants to invade practically every Muslim country on the planet. And let me tell you, the Muslims of our country, they see it and they know it.
(01:17:41)
Her father was responsible for invading the Middle East, killing millions of Arabs. Millions. And this is the one that Kamala is campaigning with. And I know Janie very well. She lost by the biggest margin in the history of the United States Congress. Lost by almost 40 points. Nobody’s ever … No sitting congressperson has ever lost by even close to that amount. And now she’s a primary endorser. It’s going to be very interesting on some of our basic issues. See if you can put those two together. They’re just trying to win. They’ll do anything to win, but that ain’t going to work. That combination. But she’s a warmongerer.
(01:18:23)
To make Kamala president would be a gamble with the lives of millions of people. She would get us into World War III because she’s too grossly incompetent to do anything about it. Your sons and your daughters will end up getting drafted. They’ll have a draft. Oh, she’d love a draft. All she wants is war. The reason I don’t get along with her is because she wanted to invade every damn country that she looked at. She’s a dope. Like her father is a dope. This person cannot be president. She’s too weak and she’s too foolish to represent America on the world stage, Kamala is.
(01:19:04)
On top of it all, Kamala say she would not do one thing differently from Joe Biden, which in itself is disqualifying. Think of it. He’s got a 90% disapproval wrong way. And she said, I wouldn’t do anything different. That means she can’t run. Take a look.

Kamala Harris (01:20:57):

Donald Trump (01:21:00):

So nobody really knew her, but now they’re learning her and her polls are crashing. She is crashing. Got to crash. Can’t have her as your president.
(01:21:12)
Kamala’s angry and bitter campaign is alienating voters nationwide. Oh, they lie so much. They lie. They lie so much. How about McDonald’s? I worked so hard at McDonald’s. She didn’t work at … She never worked there. They never saw her there. The manager of the store said, “She never worked here. She never worked here.” She’s a liar. She’s a liar. And I told you before, every commercial she does about me it’s the exact opposite. Our campaign is bringing together all Americans who want a better future for our country. That’s why we are building the biggest, broadest, and most diverse coalition in American history. There’s never been anything like this.
(01:21:58)
By the way, MAGA. Make America Great Again. This is the greatest political movement, by far, in the history of our country. That’s all. We include union workers, border patrol agents, police and firefighters. They’ve all given me their endorsements, by the way. The police, the firefighters, even the firefighters union they’ve never done it before. They gave me what they owe. They love Trump. They like Trump. They’ve always gone Democrat. It’s like a bad habit. It’s habit year after year, Democrats. And they meet me, they say, “We like that guy.”
(01:22:38)
But all veterans, steelworkers like Brian, what he does with his hands. Brian, does every auto worker have arms like you? I don’t know. Because I’m going to be an auto worker pretty soon. Are they tough? Okay. Oh they are. Oh they are. So we’re seeing historic levels of support among Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians. And let me tell you, these people coming into our country, and you’re going to see numbers that they should release now. They have them. They’re destroying the Black population jobs in this country and the Hispanic population jobs in this country. And they don’t want to put out the numbers now. They want to wait 11 days till after the election is over. She’s allowed these people to come in. They’re taking the Black population jobs and they’re taking the Hispanic jobs. Jews, Catholics, evangelicals, Mormons, Muslims are joining our cause in larger numbers than ever before. And now the most wonderful thing is happening. We’re winning overwhelming support from the Muslim and Arab voters right here in Michigan. Can you believe it? It’s great.
(01:24:07)
And earlier today I had an incredible meeting, a great meeting. You know what they want? They want peace. They want their great people with a group of Muslim Imams, and like everyone here today, Muslim and Arab voters in Michigan, they’re going to be the … They could turn the election one way or the other. I think we have it anyway. I’m telling you, we have so many votes, but we got to get more. We got to get more. But the Muslim and Arab voters in Michigan and across the country want a stop to the endless wars and a return to peace in the Middle East. That’s all they want. Like we had under President Donald J. Trump. Have you ever heard of him? We haven’t.
(01:24:53)
They want strength in the Oval Office. They want law and order. They want common sense. They’re not into the transgender operations. They’re not into men playing in women’s sports. They want a booming economy and they don’t like Kamala’s plan to provide free sex-change operations for inmates or illegal migrants in detention, or secretly change the gender of our children in school without even parental consent or knowledge. I’m thrilled to accept the endorsement. Nobody thought this was going to happen. Nobody. Because this is a great group of people, but they always were Democrat. But they look at her and they say, “Forget it.”
(01:25:42)
I’m thrilled to accept the endorsement of these highly respected leaders. These are the leaders. Today, I’m also honored to be endorsed by a very special person. And I’m going to ask all of, if I could … All of my friends to come up from the Arab and Muslim part of Michigan, and I’d like to … Give them a big hand because they’re going to vote for us and help us win.

MUSIC (01:26:24):

Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon, Michiganders. As the President said, we just had a positive meeting with President Trump. We as Muslims stand with President Trump because he promises peace. He promises peace, not war. We are supporting Donald Trump because he promised to end war in the Middle East and Ukraine. The bloodshed has to stop all over the world, and I think this man can make that happen.
(01:27:18)
I personally believe that God saved his life twice for a reason. I believe personally that God has saved his life for a reason, which is to save the lives of others. We support Donald J. Trump for his commitment to promoting family values and protected our children well-being, especially when it comes to curriculums and schools. We as Muslims support this man because we believe that he will be a president for all Americans embracing every race, color, and religion.
(01:28:14)
With are with President Trump because we want strong border, and we agree with President Trump that anyone who wants to come to this country is welcome, but he has to do that through legal pathway. We are with President Trump because we want a strong economy. Don’t you want that? We are with President Trump to make America great again through peace and justice for all. Lastly, Michiganders, I have two predictions for you for the next six months. Are you ready? Number one, the Detroit Lions will win the Super Bowl. Ready for the second prediction? I can’t hear you. Are you ready? The second prediction is Donald J. Trump will be the 47th President of the United States of America. Okay. All right. God bless you all and god bless America.

Speaker 13 (01:29:41):

USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!

Donald Trump (01:30:34):

Isn’t that amazing? Isn’t that great? They want peace. These are very good people. I want to just thank them. And that means so much. Those are the most respected leaders and I just want to really thank them a lot. A lot. That’s going to go a long way to helping us secure victory in this great state too. Let me tell you. I have a lot of great people and that’s going to go a long way today. I’m also honored to be endorsed by the mayor of Dearborn Heights, Bill Bazzi. Great guy. Come on up. Bill, come on up, Bill. He’s an engineer. He worked at Ford Motor Company, served in the Marine Corps and the Marine Corps Reserves for 21 years. He became his city’s first Muslim mayor and he’s a terrific man. Thank you. Please.

Bill Bazzi (01:31:47):

Hello Michigan. We had a lot of great speakers before me, so I don’t know if I can top what Brian said and also what the Imam said, but I can tell you one thing just based on my experience. I was born in [inaudible 01:32:05], that’s South Lebanon, and we immigrated to the U.S. at age 12. When I came to this country, just few years after I decided to join the Marines because I want to give back to the [inaudible 01:32:19]. And also I retired from the Marine Corps. I worked for two corporations, Boeing and also Ford. But one of the things that I’ve seen, one of the things I have never seen, the devastation that we’re seeing right now. When President Trump was president, it was peace. We didn’t have any issues. There was no wars. He didn’t create wars. He was actually trying to withdraw our troops from overseas.
(01:32:47)
One of the things that was really upsetting in my city, we suffered flooding in ’22 and I asked for the National Guard to come and help us because most of our city was underwater. But I was asked, “We can help you, but there’s a price tag to bring the National Guard to help Dearborn Heights.” That’s pretty sad. We’re spending billions of dollars overseas, but yet we can’t take care of our infrastructure here in the United States. Yeah. And this is the reason why I support and I endorse President Trump because we’re going to stop the wars, we’re going to make United States safe again and also we’re going to make the world safe, have some respect around the world when President Trump become the 47th president. Thank you. [inaudible 01:33:39].

Donald Trump (01:33:39):

Thank you. Wow, what a nice… Thank you. What a nice endorsement. These are great people. I also want to thank a man that’s been with us right from the beginning and I have to call him out. Mayor Ghalib of Hamtramck, Michigan for his early and strong support, and he’s an incredible guy and he was right up there in front months ago, and I just have to tell you, he started this whole thing rowing. So I want to thank the mayor and want to thank everybody that’s here. It’s a beautiful thing to see.
(01:34:29)
We’re going to set an all-time record with the Arab and Muslim voters, which you probably noticed. I saw that on one of the fake news networks last night. They were going over the polling and they said, “Huh, this is a little strange. The Arab Americans, Trump 59, Kamala Harris eight. And that was before these great endorsements. But you had to see these announcers, these anchors.
(01:35:08)
Ah, is there something that, what’s going on? Is this true? It’s true. More than true because we’re going to do something. We’re going to treat people properly. We’re going to end those wars. They want peace. We want peace. Everybody. You don’t want your sons and daughters, that’ll be next. They’ll be drafting your sons and daughters to go over there. But I want to thank everybody. That was an incredible moment. I also am pleased to be joined by a very special man. He’s going to be your next senator. He’s killing it in the polls. He’s against somebody who doesn’t have what it takes. So I just want to say hello to Mike Rogers. Mike, thank you very much, Mike.
(01:35:47)
You want come up? Come. And I’m going to tell Mike, say a couple of words, and he’s got a big speaking engagement. I said, “Mike, say a couple of words and it will be okay. Get out of here real fast and go make your speech, because we have to win.” He’s heard me speak before and he’d love to do it again, I’m sure, but we have to win. So you say a couple of words and then you skadoodle. Okay.

Mike Rogers (01:36:09):

Thank you so much. Well, thank you Mr. President. Good to see you. Last night, the president was up in Traverse City and I can’t tell you how important this is. I talked to cherry farmers up in Traverse City. Because of the dumping that’s been happening on America between Chinese and Turkish cherries, they were telling me, you want to go to the cherry festival in a few years? Guess what? You’ll be eating Chinese cherries, not Michigan cherries. I know a guy that’s going to help us fix that. Donald J. Trump. We are not going to lose our cherry industry in Michigan when you become president, Mr.
(01:36:54)
We lost in the last four years, 20,000 manufacturing jobs under Democrat policies coming out of Washington D.C. 20,000. I know a guy that’s going to help us fix that. Donald J. Trump. So listen, the stakes are high, but the choices are very, very clear. We are going to have a wide open border or we’re going to have a closed and secure border with Donald J. Trump and a Republican Senate. You either going to have high gas prices, high grocery prices, a higher cost of living, or we’re going to get an affordable life back again under Donald J. Trump and Republicans when they take the United States Senate, we are going to have a wide open border or a closed border. We need you to get out there and elect Donald J. Trump and Mike Rogers to the Senate. We are going to get America back on track with your help. Thank you, Mr. President.

Donald Trump (01:38:03):

He’s a good man, going to do a great job. And she’s terrible, by the way. Terrible. A rubber stamp for the radical left. We have another warrior, John James, representative John James, who’s fantastic. Thank you John very much. Thank you, John. He’s doing great too. Lisa McClain. Lisa, what a job you do. She is so tough and smart and she loves this place, don’t you? Thanks, Lisa. I appreciate it. And a person from a little other state, but he’s so important in Congress and such a warrior, had to introduce him. Darrell Issa. Darrell, thank you. Great job, Darrell. He’s a patriot, a warrior, and a house candidate who’s going to win. I looked at a poll. Tom Barrett is going to win and he’s going to win big. Going to win very big, Tom. Great numbers. Michigan, GOP Chairman, ambassador, Pete Hoekstra, who’s my friend. I said, “Pete, you got to take this job.”
(01:39:15)
And the job he’s done is amazing and I want to thank you, Pete. I want to thank you. And we’re winning tremendously. I don’t think we’ve ever been in a position like this where we’re winning everything. And you know why? Because they’re so bad. We’re good. We’re really good, but they’re so bad and we can’t let that happen because our country can’t take another… I’m worried about three months. You want to know the truth. I can’t take three months more. I understand we have many members of the Chaldean Christian community in our midst.
(01:39:51)
Stand up. Go ahead. Stand up. You deserve it. You’ve been treated pretty badly. Stand up. We’re going to treat you good. You have not been treated properly. Thank you very much. Look at the love. The enthusiasm, huh? Chaldean Christians, thank you very much everybody. Thank you for being here. Thank you. Get out and vote. Get out and vote. No, they’re great people. A man who’s a very special man. He’s the father to Tiffany’s husband, Tiffany’s going to have a baby. And she’s been a great person, good student, good everything, and married this man’s son, and this is a highly respected man all over the world. Dr. Massad Boulos. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. Thank you. And Ambassador Joe Cella. Thank you Joe. Thank you very much.
(01:40:58)
Here are the facts. Kamala Harris is a radical left Marxist, rated even worse than crazy Bernie Sanders or Pocahontas. You know who Pocahontas is? She destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of Defund The Police, you know that? She headed up Defund The Police. And anybody who wants to defund the police for even one week is not worthy of being a President of the United States. Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE. The brave patriots, tough guys, the brave patriots of ICE. We didn’t have them, would never be able to get the bad ones out of our country. They’re tough and they love our country. She vowed repeatedly to ban fracking. She wants to ban fracking in Pennsylvania and all over the country, until about a year ago when she said, “Oh, I love fracking very much.
(01:41:55)
As California Attorney General, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon and rape of an unconscious person as totally nonviolent crimes. She pledged to confiscate your guns. Would anybody like to give up their gun in this?

Crowd (01:42:14):

No.

Donald Trump (01:42:14):

Anybody would like to give up? We have somebody waiting outside to grab it. And then probably give it to the bad guys. The bad guys aren’t giving up their guns. That we know. And endorsed a total ban on handgun ownership. She has a ban on handgun ownership. She even called for free sex changes for illegal aliens in detention. She lies about everything. And don’t forget McDonald’s, that was a bad one to me. But on top of everything else, she wants to turn our military woke. Take a look.

We won two world wars. Those wars would not have been won. We won those wars with others, but we won those wars. In conclusion, with your vote this November, we are going to fire Kamala and we are going to save our country. We are going to save America. With your support, we’ll cut your taxes, end inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages and bring thousands of factories back to America and right here to Michigan. We’re bringing them back to Detroit. We’re bringing them back to Michigan. A lot of them will come right here.
(01:45:20)
We will build American. We will buy American and we will hire American workers. We’re going to hire a lot of them. Get ready. I will end the war in Ukraine, which would’ve never started if I were president, would’ve never happened. Would’ve never happened, the war in Ukraine. All those people that are dead, all those cities that are destroyed, all those magnificent domes, golden domes that are laying on their sides smashed to smithereens. I will stop the chaos in the Middle East and I will prevent World War III 100%. We will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources and respect they so dearly deserve. We will strengthen and modernize our military. We will build a large-scale, massive missile defense shield, all of it made in the U.S., much of it made in Michigan.
(01:46:20)
We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington, D.C., making them safe and clean and beautiful once again. We will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our school. And we will keep men out of women’s sports right away. Day one. I will defend religious liberty, I will restore free speech and I will defend the right to keep and bear arms, our Second Amendment. After years and years of building up foreign nations, defending our foreign borders and protecting foreign lands, we are finally going to build our own country. We are going to take care of our own people. We will defend our borders and protect our citizens, and we will stop illegal immigration once and for all.
(01:47:40)
We will not be invaded. We will not be occupied. We will not be overrun. We will not be conquered. We will be a free and proud nation once again. Everyone will prosper. Every family will thrive and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope and filled with the possibility for those that want to really work hard of the American dream, we’re going to have the American dream back in our country. But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda with a landslide that simply is too big to rig. That’s what we’re doing right now. Early voting is underway. Get everyone you know and vote. Does everybody give me their word they’re going to go out and vote, everybody? Please. We need it, saving our country. We need it. After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of our country. This is a little bit sad because in another 11 days we won’t be doing this anymore. Hopefully we’re going to be going on to something very big, but we’ve had the greatest rallies, the greatest time, and really talking about very bad things, but doing it in a positive fashion. Bad things, bad things happen to our country over the last four years, but we’ve been doing this really together for nine years. And in 11 days we won’t be doing this any longer, we’ll be doing other things.
(01:49:27)
So it’s a little bit sad because there has never been anything like this done in the history of our country and probably it will never happen again. When you have a candidate in four years, they’ll come to your beautiful Michigan and they’ll bring with them about 200 people. It’s not going to be like this. I’m going from here to another wonderful place and we’re going to have big crowds. No, there’s never been any… The spirit, I don’t know if it’s ever going to be replicated, but I just want to tell you, I love you all. I love you all.
(01:49:59)
Thank you. Thank you very much. With your help, from now until election day, we will redeem America’s promise. We will put America first and we will take back the nation that we love. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. I will never give in. I will never up. I will never back down and we will never, ever, ever, ever, ever surrender. Together we will fight, fight, fight and vote, vote, vote. Get out there and vote. November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country and together we will make America powerful again. Make America wealthy again. Make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. Make America proud again. Make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you Michigan. Good luck. God bless you, Michigan. God bless you all. Thank you. Thank you.

Donald Trump (01:15):

Wow.

Speaker 2 (01:15):

USA. USA. USA.

Donald Trump (02:36):

Well, thank you very much. This is quite a gathering, isn’t it? This is it, we’re getting to the end. We’re getting to the end, and we’re leading in all the polls, so that’s a good thing. We better keep it going. Like your wrestling team, we better keep it going. A very big hello to Pennsylvania. Thank you very much. This is some little gathering we have. We really give a very special hello to Penn State. We love Penn State. We love Penn State. I’m thrilled to be here, the home of the Nittany Lions with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. You’re very special.
(03:27)
I think I’d like to begin by asking a very simple question, are you better off now than you were four years ago?

Speaker 2 (03:34):

No.

Donald Trump (03:38):

So I’m here today with a message of hope for all Americans. If you want to go out and win an election… Do you want to win an election? Because we are leading, but we got to close it out, right? We got to close it out. I will promise you we’re going to end inflation very quickly. We’re going to get those prices down too. I’ll stop the invasion of criminals pouring into our country. They’re criminals and they’re pouring in like we’ve never seen. We’re going to stop it. We’re going to get them the hell out of here. I will bring back the American dream because you want the American dream and we’re going to bring it back. So this is all you really need to know: Kamala broke it, and I will fix it. We’re going to fix it very fast.
(04:29)
We’re going to fix our country up very fast. With your support on November 5th, America will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer, and stronger than ever before. We’re going to do it fast. This election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of gross incompetence and failure, it’s disgusting what they’re doing, or whether we’ll begin the four greatest years in the history of our country. I’m asking you to be excited about the future. You want to be excited about the future. People aren’t excited about this country very much anymore with the people we have in there. We have the worst president in the history of our country. We have the worst vice president, a grossly incompetent person in the history of our country. I’m asking you to dream big again. You’re going to dream big just like your wrestling team dreams big. Where the hell are they?
(05:24)
Where are they? I hear that team is brutal out there, I can tell. It’s easy to tell, I can pick every one of them off. Jim Jordan told me about you guys. You know, Jim Jordan, he told me about… Look at them over there, muscles all over the place. You better get ready because they’re going to bring you up here in a little while. So you guys better get ready. You guys better get ready. Maybe I’ll wrestle one of them or two of them, huh? That would be an upset. No, no, I’m not going to play that game. Anyway, you get ready, we’re bringing you up here in a little while, okay? So tone up those muscles a little bit. Congratulations fellas, that’s fantastic. Man, that’s a fantastic record you have. This will be America’s new golden age and every problem facing us can be solved. But now, the fate of our nation is in your hands.
(06:21)
And it really is. It’s a big thing. This is the biggest election in the history of our country because our country really has gone bad. It’s gone bad it’s so sad. When you look at the things we’re doing that we even have to say like men playing in women’s sports. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. No, but you think of it, so many things, all the transgender operations, all the coming into our country, they’re letting criminals into our country by the millions. Pennsylvania, you have to stand up and you have to tell Kamala Harris that… I can’t even believe I’m saying the name Kamala, nobody ever heard of her.
(07:04)
And you can’t use the name Harris. If I say Harris, Harris, they say, “Who the hell is Harris?” Did you see when she got stuck two weeks ago in the teleprompter? It was 32 days, now there’s nine days left, but it was 32 days and she’s reading and the teleprompter broke. That happens a lot. If you’re going to be a politician, you better be able to get through it without a teleprompter, but she can’t. The sucker snapped back, damn it, it snapped back. She was reading, right? She goes, “And 32 days, 32 days, 32 days, 32… ” I said, “Oh, this is bad.” And then boom, it snapped back. Too bad. But Pennsylvania, you have to stand up and you have to tell Kamala that you’ve had enough, you’re not going to take it anymore. You’re the worst vice president. You destroyed San Francisco. You are horrible to the great state of California. You’re just horrible. Kamala, you’re fired. Get out of here, Kamala. Get the hell out of here. We’ve had enough of this crap. We just went through four years with a guy that had no clue and now we’re supposed to go through another one. And she’s worse than him. She’s worse.
(08:41)
The polls are open for early voting here in Pennsylvania. I went to school in Pennsylvania. We didn’t have quite as good a wrestling team, I will admit. They were okay. Most of them would be, I think every one of them, pinned in the first minute or less. The best one would’ve lasted about a minute with these characters out here. But we had some smart people, I will say. We had some smart people. But we’re setting all-time records right now in the voting. I don’t know if you heard that, the fake news. It’s like, “Oh, look at all of the fake news.” That’s a lot of… Whoa, that’s a lot of fake news. That’s a lot of fake news. But let’s keep it going. We have to close it out. We’ve got to keep it going. We’re doing incredibly. Nobody’s done like we’re doing right now. I know you like me, but I know you’re also comparing it to what we had for four years, so that’s what’s happening with the vote.

Speaker 2 (09:43):

We love you, Trump.

Donald Trump (09:44):

I think we’re going to keep it going and we’re going to have a real landslide-type election and that’s what we have to have. But everybody has to go out and vote. Just out of curiosity, who has already voted? Okay, that’s good, because with that number and then we’re about to go and do the real thing, right? Who is going to vote?
(10:04)
That’s good. That’s great. Well, thanks for the early voters, but the Republicans tend to vote late. They like Tuesdays and that’s fine. Just get out and vote. Everybody promise you’re going to vote, right? Promise?

Speaker 2 (10:19):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (10:22):

Okay. If you’re a student here at Penn State, and it really is, it’s a great place, I’ve known it for a long time, I know so many people that have graduated and done so well here, you can vote in person, you can vote by mail. Then get your friends, call your parents, call your grandparents, your cousins, call anybody. A woman named Jane, I know her very well, she said to her husband, he is a big slob of a guy, big [inaudible 00:10:48], and she said to him, “Harold, get the hell out of that sofa. Get out right now, Harold. We’re getting out. We’re going to vote for the president.” “But I’m watching the game.” “Get your ass out of the sofa.” And he got up and he voted. He feels good about himself now. And he sat back down and he watched the game.
(11:10)
But get everyone to swamp the vote. We want to swamp them. We want to make it too big to rig because bad things happen with these guys. We’ve got to make it too big. The one thing you do, you make it too big, they can’t do a thing. So let’s get out. Everybody has to get out. We want to have a big margin. We want to have a big, fat, beautiful margin. With your help 10 days from now, we are going to win Pennsylvania, we’re going to defeat Kamala Harris, and we are going to make America great again.
(11:50)
I’m looking at this crowd, it’s such a young crowd. It’s a young crowd, got a lot of young people here. That’s what people haven’t really gotten. Frankly, we have a lot of everything, and it’s a great honor to be representing you. We’ve been on this journey for a long time together. We’ve all had a lot of victories. We’ve had the best rallies ever. Outside you have as many people as this standing out there. If anybody would like to give up their seat or their location, I’m sure that you’d have it filled very quickly if you’d like to do that. I don’t think too many people are going to do that. But we’ve had great success. In one way, it’s beautiful and another way it’s a little sad because we’ve had these rallies and we have nine days to go to total victory, and then we’re going to have a different kind of a victory.
(12:43)
We’re going to turn our nation around. We’re going to have control of a situation that needs having control of. We’re going to turn it around. It’s going to happen really fast too. Two things, first day, first hour, we can do many things in the first, but first, we’re going to drill, baby, drill. And we’re going to close our borders to criminals and drug dealers and all of these people coming in from mental institutions. We are going to have those borders closed. They asked me, “What would you do?” I listed about six things. They asked her, “What would you do different?” Did you see her answer? “Oh, oh, oh, I don’t know. I don’t know.”
(13:38)
Right side, wrong side, right path, wrong path. They’re at 90% wrong path and she doesn’t know. “I think I’d leave everything the same.” That’s the end of that election. When she said that, I said, “That’s got to be the greatest ad ever.” Right, Marjorie? Look at Marjorie Taylor Green, very shy person. We have great congresspeople here. She’s a very shy person, John, right? And John, you love these guys back here, huh? Great John Joyce.
(14:09)
For all the young people here at Penn State and across America who may be voting for the first time, I want you to know that I am in this fight for you. I didn’t need this. Had a nice life.

Speaker 2 (14:23):

Thank you.

Donald Trump (14:23):

I’ll tell you what, I’ve been investigated more than the great Alphonse Capone. Did you ever hear of Al Capone? You think this has been fun? But we had four of the greatest years. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. Think of this, we had the strongest border. Oh, let’s bring my favorite chart of all time. Can you do it? Do it. You got to do this. Yes. Without that chart, I wouldn’t be here. I turned around and said, “Bring down the chart.” I wouldn’t be here, I guess, probably. But see the arrow on the bottom, that’s the lowest in history. This was done by the border patrol and that was my last day in office. And then these incompetent people took over. What they’ve done to our country, it’s unbelievable. Look at what happened. It’s all illegal immigration, criminals pouring into our country at levels that we’ve never seen before, drugs pouring into our country 10 times more than we had seen ever. The country is just… It’s in freefall. We’re a nation in decline, and we’re going to turn it around. We’re going to turn it around fast.
(15:48)
But even beyond that, even if it didn’t show those great numbers, I love that chart. I sleep with it every night. I hold it. I kiss it. Okay, we love you, darling. Thank you. Put it away. But it’s true. I mean, you take a look at those numbers, it’s just incredible. That was the single lowest time, and then they came in and it just… All they had to do was leave it. We had remain in Mexico. How about that? Do you think that was easy to get? And we paid nothing? All I did is say, “If you don’t let us have it, we’re going to tariff every product you have at 25%.” They said, “We’d love for you to have very bad people remain in Mexico, gang members.” This was in Tijuana. That was a dangerous place. That was a dangerous place. Hundreds of thousands of people say, “This little town… ” Tijuana was probably the fastest-growing town in the world because of remain in Mexico.
(16:43)
We had a great system and we were doing it and everything was good. We had a terrible result. We did better in 2020 than we did in 2016, millions of more votes, but it was COVID and a lot of bad things happened, a lot of bad things. And so I said, “Do I go to the beach or stay at one of my very beautiful… ” I have the greatest resorts in the world. I could have been extremely happy. I could have had those beautiful waves smack me in the face. I could have had the beautiful sun tan. This white, white skin could have been tan and beautiful. But if I had it to do again, I would’ve done the exact same thing because I want to be with you right here at Penn State, and we want to make our country great again. We’re going to make America great again. It’s true. That’s true.
(17:37)
We did so well the second time, but then I sat back and I watched and I thought we did a good job, we did a great job as president. We built our military, got the biggest tax cuts ever. We had the biggest regulation cuts, which actually were probably even more meaningful than the tax cuts. We had the best job numbers. It was great. We rebuilt our military. I sat back and I assumed that these people would do okay or good. They were so bad. I watched, I couldn’t believe it, and I said, “I got to do it again. I got to do it again.”
(18:13)
In fact, I was going to have a theme, not make America great, it was keep America great, KAG, but MAG is much better than KAG. True KAG. Keep America great, the problem was America became not great, and so we couldn’t do that. And then I said, “We have to run because these people have no idea what the hell they’re doing.” And now we’re running and we’re leading and we have to finish it off, and then we’re going to turn it around even better than before. We’re going to make it stronger and better. So many people come up to me at all these places, we just had a big one in Detroit, but they come up to me in all the different places, they said, “I had the best four years I’ve ever had.” You have the same thing.
(18:57)
And now it’s tough, sir. It’s really tough. We’re going to get it back. You’re going to have even better than before. We’re going to bring businesses in, bring jobs in. It’s all coming back. You watch, it’s come back fast. But the reason I’ve gone through all of these battles and endured all of the abuse I have certainly have in history… Andrew Jackson was considered the president who was really probably hit the hardest, and then Abraham Lincoln. But in all fairness, he had a little civil war going. But now I think I hit the top of that list. But we’re going to do something that’s going to be amazing. We’re going to turn this country around so fast. We have to. We have to do it and we’re going to do it.
(19:44)
We want to make it so that when your children come into prominence they’re going to take over something that they can be so proud of. They’re going to inherit the America that they deserve and that you deserve them to have. Kamala Harris is an incompetent person who in all fairness got no votes. Sleepy Joe Biden had 14 million votes, then he went to sleep. We had a debate, he didn’t do well in debate, it’s all right, and he went down and they went to him and they said, “You’re out.” They took over the presidency of the United States. I don’t even use the word coup. It was a coup. But basically, they took over the presidency. They told him to get the hell out, crazy Nancy Pelosi, the group, Schumer, the whole group. And then they talk about democracy, “Oh, democracy.” No, she got no votes. He got 14 million. All of a sudden, I’m running against her.
(20:47)
I have a great friend, Dana White, UFC. Probably some of these guys will be there. But this is like they have a fight and the fighter is not doing well and they say, “Get him out of there. Let’s replace him with another fighter.” I got to take two people, but the second one, I think in her own way might be easier than the first. I’ll let you know on November 5th. But we have to get this thing and we have to get it big. Kamala will destroy your inheritance. But much more importantly, she’s going to destroy your country. If you vote for me, I will ensure that you begin your careers, young people, in a roaring economy, in a time of unprecedented peace and prosperity. I had no wars. Crooked Hillary Clinton said, “Look at him. He’s going to take us into wars.” I said, “No, no.” She said, “But look at that personality. He’s going to take us into wars.” I said, “No, my personality’s going to keep us out of wars.” That’s what we did. We had no wars. First president in 82 years, other than ISIS, which we defeated in record time, we knocked the hell out of them. And we have a great military, remember. Not these stupid

Donald Trump (22:00):

… people that you watch on television, like Milley and Mattis, the real people, the real generals. We knocked out ISIS and they said it would take five years. We did it in about five weeks, and we have a great military. I flew to Iraq and I met with the generals. They were like central casting. They looked like Tom Cruise, but better looking, much better looking actually, because they know how to fight. These guys were great. Everybody did a great job for me, but we had no wars. We had peace through strength. It was a great thing. Peace through strength, and that’s it. You don’t have to send your kids out to war, have your kid blown up for a country that you’ve never heard of and that doesn’t want anything to do with you anyway, but I will not send you to fight and die in a foolish never-ending foreign war.
(22:50)
I’ll get you out of the wokeness and your schools will be great again. Your schools are going to be great. We’ll end left-wing censorship and I’ll defend your God-given rights, and I will ensure that you inherit the freest, strongest and most powerful nation on the face of the earth. That’s what we’re going to do. We rebuilt the entire military and then these stupid people gave a big chunk of it to Afghanistan for what? There was no reason. Now, here’s the good news. It was a lot, but it was very little by comparison.
(23:22)
But to see them have that it is just not even believable and we have it. I didn’t lose one soldier in 18 months. I spoke to the head of the Taliban, Abdul. I said, “Abdul, don’t do it.” Anyway, I can’t go exactly, because it’s not nice. He’s still there. Do you know Abdul is still there? But I said, “Don’t do it, Abdul, don’t do it.”
(23:46)
He said, “But why? Why do you send me a picture of my home?”
(23:50)
I said, “Abdul…” Anyway, what happened with Abdul and we were fine. 18 months, we went without a soldier being killed or even shot at. Think of it, 18 months. And then when these guys, we had a very great election, but it was… By the way, I got the most votes in the history of our country for a sitting President. Can you imagine? But they say they beat us.
(24:24)
He got a few more votes sitting in his basement, not talking, and it’s a disgrace. But you know what? This will be, we’re going to pull this off, it will be the greatest victory in the history of our country for all of us. Not for me, for all of us, for all of us. And starting on day one of my new administration, I will end Kamala Harris’s war on Pennsylvania energy and we will frack, frack, frack, okay? She’s not going to frack. That’s a big part of Pennsylvania. The fracking is a big part. She’s been against it for her whole life. She’s been against anything having to do with anything underground. She’ll build a windmill. It kills all your birds. Isn’t that wonderful? But no, she’s against anything having to do with fracking, except about a year ago she learned that she’s going to need Pennsylvania.
(25:24)
So she turned her thing and she said, “Oh, I’d love to see people frack.” She had no idea what it was, but she said, “Frack, frack.”
(25:32)
And she changed. But you know with the politician, they always go with what’s number one? She’ll switch in two minutes, all of the different things. She wants transgender operations for people that are in penitentiaries if they demand it. All of a sudden she says no. We had a very short time with her. She had a little honeymoon period, because nobody knew anything about her. When they found out about her, she went down the tubes. Yesterday she had Beyonce, because she can’t draw a crowd. See this crowd? This crowd is packed. I could sell it out three times. You got to see outside, and we don’t have Beyonce, who couldn’t fill the arena last night. But the people went there, because they thought they were going to hear Beyonce sing, right?
(26:18)
Beyonce got out and said, “Hello, ladies and gentlemen, I’d like to endorse her. What’s her name? What’s her name? What is her name again? Oh, I’m going to endorse her.”
(26:30)
Oh, they just don’t get it. So what happened is the crowd came, because they thought she was going to sing. Then she turned around, she left and Kamala started speaking, and it was a disaster. They all left. Everybody left. We don’t need anybody, because we are here. Let me be nice. We are here for policy reasons. Oh, policy. We’re here for common sense. So the truth is, we’re really the party of common sense. When you get right down there. And they send buses out, they have plenty of money. They get it from the unions and a couple of other, they got a lot of money. They always had more money than the Republicans. But we have much better policy. We have much better ideas. They cheat much better. That’s one thing I’ll say. They cheat. Nobody cheats like that. Nobody cheats like that. But I’ll tell you what, we’re going to have, this is going to be the greatest victory in the history of our country. It’s going to be an exciting night on November 5th.
(27:37)
Kamala has said repeatedly that she wants to ban fracking. She was going to do it. That’s 500,000 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania jobs. By the way, never ever called a state. I had a friend, a poor guy. He was a friend of one of the congressmen right there, GG. He was our friend of our congressman. He got up and he started talking about the state of Pennsylvania. He was dead. That was the end, right? He was dead. He died. He was dying up here. He didn’t know what he was doing wrong.
(28:07)
We were trying to send him a message. It’s got to be called the Commonwealth, right? Well, Biden called it the state, right? But you know, how about Biden? When you go to Florida, it’s great to be in New Hampshire. It’s great. That’s what we knew that that wasn’t going to work out too well. Kamala is crushing your energy industry with her vicious natural gas export ban currently going on. You don’t know about that. And with a green new scam, Kamala Harris is closing down your power plants. Just take a look. This is on fracking, 500,000 Pennsylvania jobs. Take a look.

Speaker 3 (28:47):

Kamala Harris pushed the far-left Green New Deal. That means huge new taxes, increased utility bills, and banning gas cars.

Kamala Harris (28:55):

That’s why I am committed to passing a Green New Deal and finally putting an end to fracking once and for all.

Speaker 4 (29:02):

Mm-mm, Mamala Kamala just don’t give a frack.

Speaker 3 (29:05):

Kamala’s fracking ban would kill jobs and raise gas prices. Kamala doesn’t give a frack about you. Only President Trump will bring back Trump’s strong economy.

Donald Trump (29:15):

I’m Donald J. Trump and I approve this message.
(29:26)
I was actually, I’m just looking at my hair. I don’t like it. I should have been looking a little left. No, I started looking at my hair, [inaudible 00:29:39]… Am I allowed to go back and re-comb it? No. Now she was against fracking from the beginning. I’ve been against nothing. I was the exact opposite. I was in favor of what? Because it’s tremendous wealth. We have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country in the world. More than Saudi Arabia, more than Russia, more than anybody. And we’re going to start using it. We’re going to make a lot of money. We’re going to pay down debt. We’re going to do a lot of things.
(30:14)
But she was against it from the day she was born. Her father was a Marxist and I guess is a Marxist professor of economics, which is an interesting play on words, Marxist and an economics. And I don’t know, and I think your father wants to come out now, which is good, because we’re trying to see. I bet he’s a nice man, but we would like to have him say, but we just want to win this thing fair and square. It doesn’t matter how we win. We have to win this battle to save our country. Our country is going so bad under Kamala’s high-cost energy policies, Pennsylvania electricity prices are already up 50% and are projected to more than double in the years ahead. Year and a half, they expect to be double. Not only are they not going to be double, your energy prices, that’s car, gasoline, because we’re going to end the electric mandate immediately, okay?
(31:13)
Your energy prices will be cut in half within 12 months from January 20th, which is when we would take over. So your energy prices, and that’s going to bring down the price of everything. That’s how they screwed up our country. That’s one of the ways, one of the many ways. They spent too much. They borrowed too much. They did everything too much. But we’re going to cut your energy prices by 50% and we can do it. Most countries can’t even think about that. We can do it, because we have it right under our feet. We have more than anybody. We have ANWR in Alaska, the biggest find anywhere in the world, as big as Saudi Arabia they think. Whether it is or not, it’s close. And I got it done. Ronald Reagan couldn’t get it done. Nobody could get it done. I got it done. We’re all set to go.
(32:01)
This guy gets in. First thing they did is cancel ANWR. We’ll get that started immediately. We’ll supply all of Asia with oil and gas, which they need. But Kamala’s energy disaster stops the day I take office. We will terminate the green new scam immediately. I will stop energy price hikes. I will rescind the natural gas export ban. They ban it. They ban it. They don’t know why. If you ask them, “Why did you ban it?”
(32:33)
“Well, we don’t really know.”
(32:36)
We’ll have energy independence. Again, think of it. Energy independent. Just four years ago, for most of American history, Pennsylvania was the commercial and industrial powerhouse of the United States of America. But after years of globalist, radical left politicians making bad decisions like Kamala, they waged a war on your Commonwealth like never before. And they annihilated your steel mills, decimated your coal jobs, assaulted your oil and gas jobs, and sold off your manufacturing jobs to China and other foreign nations all over the world.
(33:15)
They destroyed so many states. They’re going to come back. Under the Trump administration, we’re going to take back what is rightfully ours. We’re going to bring it back with smart tariffs, tariffs, taxes, not on you, by the way. The taxes aren’t on you. Taxes are in other countries that have been ripping us off for years, and we did it with the USMCA. But we’re going to do things that you won’t even believe. These companies are going to be begging to come back, because if they don’t come back and open up plants here, they’re not going to be selling their product in the United States, okay? They’re not going to be selling their product. We’re going to end the looting and the pillaging of Pennsylvania. We will bring back our manufacturing jobs, our energy jobs, our coal jobs, our steel jobs, and we’re going to bring back our dreams starting in January.
(34:08)
We will give our companies the lowest taxes, the lowest energy costs, the lowest regulatory burdens, and free access to the best and biggest market on the planet. And it is, but it won’t be that for long. If you have a couple of more years, you’re not going to have the best and biggest, and we’re going to lose the dollar, the sanctity of the dollar. And once that happens, that’s like losing a war. The centerpiece of this plan will be a 15% made in America corporate tax rate, cutting the tax from 21 to 15. Just so you know, it was almost at 40. And everyone said, “You won’t be able to get it down.”
(34:44)
I got it down to almost 21, to 21%, got it passed by Congress, and we took in more money at 21 than we did at almost 40. Think of that. The money was flowing. We did a tax cut that created jobs. Businesses were coming in, and now we’re going to take the 21% down to 15, which makes us the most competitive nation in the world. So the biggest and most competitive. But here’s the hitch, but only, and this is pretty cool. This is my idea. I’m very proud. I had calls from the biggest, most intelligent, supposedly intelligent. What’s intelligence? I don’t know. But the most intelligent people on Wall Street. Where did you come up with the idea? Because I’m saying you’re only getting the low tax rate, and it’s only going to be for those who make their product here in the USA and hire American workers for the job. So they go down from 21 to 15, but they have to make their product here, right here, like in Pennsylvania.
(35:58)
And if these companies don’t make their products here, then they will pay a stiff tariff when they sell their products and send their products into the United States for the privilege of competing with our workers. We don’t want that. And our cherished and now protected companies, we’re going to protect those companies that have made the investment and companies that are here that will leave. And I did do a big favor, because you do a lot of auto parts especially. So you probably heard that in Mexico, that China was going to build among the largest auto plants in the world. They were going to knock out cars left and right, destroy Michigan, destroy Detroit. I just left Detroit. They were very happy. So about a year ago, I found out about, I have a friend. He builds the plants. He’s the biggest in the world at building the plants.
(36:45)
I said, “I want to see an auto plant. You got to show me one.” I said, “Where would we go?”
(36:50)
He said, “Mexico.”
(36:51)
I said, “I don’t want to go to Mexico. I want to see one here.”
(36:54)
He said, “We don’t make them here. We make them in Mexico. We make them in China.” He said, “What’s that all about?” He said, “That’s the way it is. We don’t make them.”
(37:01)
I said, “So I can’t see one here. I don’t want to go to Mexico.” But they were going to build the biggest plant in the world in Mexico. When I heard this, I said, “Wow.”
(37:10)
Or then I leave Detroit and they’re taken out, they lost 38% of their automobile business. Since they took over 38% of the automobile business has gone. This is after decades of just losing, losing, losing to other countries. So I did you all a favor. I said, “That big beautiful plant that they’re going to make, billions of dollars. It’s going to make thousands and thousands of cars virtually a day. It’s the biggest. It would be bigger, almost bigger than all of Michigan automobile manufacturing and just a couple of plants.” I said, “I’m going to put a tariff on every single car that’s made in Mexico, owned by China, and it’s going to be so high that it won’t work.”
(37:59)
And I don’t give a, it’s not going to work. And I’ll make it a hundred percent. And if that doesn’t do it, I’ll raise it up to 200%. They’re not going to have one car come into our country. And I saw that man when I was, two weeks ago in Detroit, in the economic club, making a speech, beautiful people, beautiful everything, beautiful room. Everything was perfect. And I look out in the audience and I see the man that builds the plants.
(38:25)
I said, I got to see that guy. So I say, “John, how are you doing with that big plant in Mexico?”
(38:31)
He said, “Sir, it’s been terminated. It’s been dropped. They think you’re going to become president and they’re going to lose their shirt if they, because you’re going to put tariffs on…”
(38:41)
So I did you a favor. I did you a favor, because they won’t be able to sell any cars, because we were going to put the tariff so high that it wouldn’t work. And other countries do that to us, but we have the best, we could do it better. We have the pot of gold that we’re going to keep the pot of gold. So that was a great thing. Say thank you, Pennsylvania. But no, but Detroit. I’ll tell you, they are so happy. Because that was going to wipe out Michigan. That was going to wipe out… That’s why the autoworkers in Michigan love Trump.
(39:12)
And you know what? I won the Teamster vote. How about that? The Teamsters like Trump. They all like Trump. The firemen like Trump and law enforcement. We’ve got every law enforcement group virtually in the entire country, every law. She hasn’t got one. She doesn’t have one cop in a corner that didn’t like somebody. She has nobody, because she’s horrible in crime. She’s horrible in everything. We will also pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act. If China or any other country charges us a 100 or 200% tax, then we will charge them a 100 or 200% tax in return. It’s called an eye for an eye. And you know what’s going to happen? They’re not going to charge us any more tax. That’s going to happen. Or they’ll move their companies into the United States and we’re going to be their workers. That’s the way it goes. And then they won’t have the tax to pay.
(40:05)
It’s very simple. If Kamala, do you think she thinks about this? She has no idea what the hell I’m even talking about. She’s probably sitting there. She thinks she’s going to raise taxes on companies by 40, 50%. That would mean you all lose the jobs and they’ll just go to another country. Because a lot of these executives, they’re international executives, a lot of them don’t even live here. They don’t even come from here. They don’t care. They go where the best deal is. When I get it down to 15%, and then we have everything else going for us, nobody can compete. They’re going to be pouring into our country, but they’ll leave our country if you raise their taxes to a certain… They’ll leave. They don’t give a damn. They couldn’t care less. If Kamala gets four more years, she’ll obliterate our economy. Kill millions of jobs, destroy your family finances.
(40:54)
And many people will die, because they’re going to be coming across the border at levels that are five times greater than even now. You’ll have 200 million people coming in. Not 21 million. 21 million people came in in three and a half years. There’s never been a border in history where a number like that. But you’ll have 200 million. You won’t even have a country anymore. Kamala’s inflation nightmare has already cost a typical family over $30,000 in higher prices. And now she wants to raise the typical family’s taxes by $3,000 a year. Congratulations. Does anybody, this is the only person I’ve ever seen campaign on, “I will raise your taxes.”
(41:39)
All my life I’ve watched politicians. “We will cut your taxes. We will…
(41:43)
She said, “We’ll raise your taxes.”
(41:45)
There’s something wrong with this whole deal. I’ll tell you, this country’s gone crazy. The taxing queen they call her, is also demanding a shocking 33% tax hike on all domestic production. Take a look.

Kamala Harris (42:02):

Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax bill.

Speaker 5 (42:03):

Calling for a full repeal of President Trump’s tax cuts.

Speaker 6 (42:07):

If Kamala Harris was elected President, there are many different tax policies which could cripple the economy. But the first thing she wants to do is allow these Trump tax cuts to expire.

Speaker 7 (42:16):

Even the New York Times admits that 85% of the middle class got a tax cut.

Speaker 8 (42:21):

Americans will face a hike. Tax foundation, finding that a couple with two kids making $165,000 a year would have to pay over $2, 400 more in tax.

Kamala Harris (42:32):

And on day one, I will repeal that tax bill. Joe Biden and I are about to work to get rid of that tax cut. Joe and I are about to get rid of that tax bill. Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax cut.

Speaker 9 (42:44):

Everything from a 70 to 80% tax rate.

Kamala Harris (42:47):

I think that’s fantastic. We’ve got to increase the corporate tax rate. Part of that is going to be about repealing that tax bill that they just passed, and also looking at estate tax. Is it going to have to go up? We will tax capital gains, but we’re going to have to raise corporate taxes.

Speaker 10 (43:01):

Taxing unrealized gains just doesn’t seem fair in any sense of the word.

Speaker 11 (43:06):

When the value of your home goes up, you pay higher taxes, even if you don’t sell your home.

Kamala Harris (43:09):

Your value of your home never moves the way the stock moves. To say, “We’re going to tax what you don’t have.” That’s a sore point and it’s a big deal. Is that something you think she firmly believes in?

Speaker 12 (43:20):

I think it’s part of the proposals of the campaign.

Kamala Harris (43:22):

Under my plan, there will also be a carbon fee. There has to be some connection between the fee and bad behaviors. And there has to be in that, we have to monitor whether it’s going to be passed on to consumers. But I’m going to tell you that should never be the reason not to actually put a fee and in particular, carbon fee.

Donald Trump (43:45):

So first of all, the sound up there is lousy. So here’s what happens. I tell my people immediately, “Don’t pay the bill for the guy that did that,” okay? And then they get a story. Trump doesn’t want to pay the bill. No. You know, when people do a lousy job, they did a lousy job with the sound.

Donald Trump (44:00):

… sound, but the good news is you understand it. They want to raise your taxes and that’s not acceptable. I will massively cut taxes for workers and small businesses. We have a lot of taxes we’re going to be cutting, getting rid of, but we’re going to have some special ones. There’ll be no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security benefits for our seniors. And I’ll also make interest on car loans. This is one that nobody thought of. We’re going to make interest because we want to build cars, right? So this is like getting a cut in price, a huge cut. I’ll also make interest on car loans fully tax-deductible, but only for cars made in America. I don’t care if they’re made in Japan. What the hell do I want to do it for? Because affording a car is essential to restoring the American Dream, and that’s what we want to do. We want to bring back the American Dream. We’re going to do it too.
(45:03)
As we restore our economy, we will also secure our borders. Over the past four years, Kamala Harris has orchestrated the most egregious betrayal that any leader in American history has ever inflicted on our people. She has eradicated our sovereign border and she has unleashed an army of migrant gangs who are waging a campaign of violence and terror against our citizens all over our country. Kamala has imported an invasion of criminal migrants from prisons and jails, insane asylums and mental institutions from all around the world, from Venezuela to the Congo in Africa. The Congo, they’re letting in tremendous numbers. They’re letting out all their prisoners from the prisons in the Congo, and they’re coming into the United States and they’re forcing them into our country and we’re accepting them because we’re led by stupid people and she has resettled, all of these people are being resettled.
(46:05)
You know of Springfield, a beautiful place, Springfield in Ohio. You heard about this. 52,000 people, they put in 32,000 illegal migrants. Think of it. So they wake up one day and they’ve almost doubled the size of their town. They can’t get into their hospitals. And the mayor’s a very nice person. He wants to just help them, but you can’t because the town is destroyed. And all he’s looking for is interpreters because on top of everything else, they don’t even speak the language. And then you have Aurora in Colorado, and that’s where you see these thugs from Venezuela. And she’s resettling all of these people into communities and in many cases, they prey on innocent American citizens.
(46:56)
One of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gangs that Kamala has imported into our country is the savage Venezuelan prison gang called Tren de Aragua. These are young thugs that’s taking over apartment complexes and unleashing a violent terror spree all over America. Towns all over America are petrified that they’re going to be coming here. But they’re in more than just Aurora in Colorado. And the governor’s petrified of them. He doesn’t know what to do. Now they’re even taking over Times Square in New York. Let’s take a look at these guys. This is a tough group.

Speaker 13 (47:37):

Open borders, deadly consequences.

Speaker 14 (47:39):

Border crisis. Record-high crossings are putting a strain on cities across America.

Speaker 15 (47:46):

It is a full-blown invasion.

Speaker 16 (47:47):

Armed Venezuelan gang members storming an apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado.

Speaker 17 (47:51):

When people talk about migrant crime, this is what they’re talking about.

Speaker 18 (47:54):

San Antonio, Texas, just one of the latest cities to have apartment complexes taken over by members of the Venezuelan gang.

Speaker 19 (48:01):

Biden and Harris had created a program to bring them in under humanitarian parole.

Kamala Harris (48:05):

I am in favor of saying that we’re not going to treat people who are undocumented cross-borders criminals.

Speaker 20 (48:10):

More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder have been released into the United States.

Speaker 21 (48:17):

My 20-year-old daughter, Kayla Hamilton, was murdered in her own room. Kayla’s murderer was apprehended by Border Patrol crossing illegally into the US.

Speaker 22 (48:25):

Kayla’s murderer had been improperly released into the United States.

Speaker 23 (48:29):

Abolish ICE.

Kamala Harris (48:30):

Yeah, we need to probably think about starting from scratch.

Speaker 24 (48:33):

More than a dozen people suspected of being Tren de Aragua gang members right here in San Antonio.

Speaker 25 (48:38):

The gang members have been terrorizing the apartment complex.

Speaker 26 (48:41):

New details in the murder of Laken Riley.

Speaker 27 (48:43):

The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuela natural.

Speaker 28 (48:48):

He was paroled and released into the country by the Biden administration.

Bill Clinton (48:52):

If they’d all been properly vetted, that probably wouldn’t have happened.

Speaker 29 (48:55):

Two men investigators say are in the country illegally from Venezuela are charged with capital murder in the death of Jocelyn Nungaray.

Speaker 30 (49:01):

Martinez-Rangel wrapped his arms around Jocelyn’s neck, took off her pants and climbed on top of her, later strangled Jocelyn to death and then tied up her hands and feet.

Speaker 31 (49:11):

Court documents suggest a group of men arrested for beating and robbing a Dallas woman last month are members of a Venezuelan street gang.

Speaker 32 (49:18):

The men threatened to cut off her fingers if she did not cooperate. Manuel Hernandez-Hernandez was booked by Colleyville Police just two days earlier and released the day before the robbery.

Speaker 31 (49:30):

The Peruvian gang leader who was wanted for 23 murders, who was arrested by Border Patrol near Roma, Texas, then released into America.

Donald Trump (49:38):

And this is what we have coming into our country and we’re not going to have it any longer that I can tell you. And we’re going to have to get a lot of them out fast because we’re not safe. And the United States has now become essentially an occupied country. We’re an occupied country. Talking about tens of thousands of people like this. But it will soon be an occupied country no longer. November 5, 2024 will be liberation day in America. It’s going to be liberation day.
(50:21)
Under Kamala Harris, 13,099, this was Border Patrol numbers, illegal alien convicted murders. These are convicted murders in prisons all over the world are on the loose in the United States. We’ve become a dumping ground for nations all over the world. They’re dumping people into our country that they don’t want because they’re too dangerous and they’re too expensive to take care of.
(50:50)
It’s very expensive having them in jail for 50 years and they bring them to us. I said something yesterday, I thought it was terrible, and then I realized it was actually good, first time I ever said it. We’ve become like a garbage can for the rest of the world. They’re throwing all their garbage into our country. And we’re not taking it. And they know we’re not taking it. They don’t want me to win this election that I can tell you because we live with these people and we’ll get killed by these people. These are dangerous people. These are really dangerous people. There’s nothing you’re going to do about it to make them less dangerous.
(51:27)
Immediately upon taking the oath of office, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. And I will rescue every town across America that’s been invaded and conquered. They’ve been conquered. These towns have been conquered. And we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail or we’ll kick them the hell out of our country and fast.
(51:56)
And to expedite removals of Tren de Aragua and other savage groups and gangs like MS-13, one of the most violent gangs of the world in Long Island. They, for whatever reason, they go to Long Island. Two young girls, 16 years old, were walking to school and they were captured by these animals. And they don’t use guns because they’re not painful enough. They use knives. And they cut the girls up into little pieces killing them both. And they paid a price. But you know what? They should have never been in our country.
(52:35)
I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. We have to go back that far. Think of that. Because that’s when they ran the country a little tougher to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil. And if they come back into our country, it’s an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole, zero possibility. And I am hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer.
(53:19)
I will end catch and release. I will end all migrant flights. They fly them in here by the hundreds of thousands. They fly right over the borders. It’s not even believable. I will outlaw sanctuary cities and I will ban all welfare and federal benefits for illegals. And then they won’t come. They won’t come.
(53:40)
Kamala Harris is so incompetent and so unfit that she’s obviously disqualified from being President of the United States. Anybody that would’ve put up with this. She never even called. The Border Patrol they endorsed me last week, and then they endorsed me, it was full- throated. And they’ve endorsed me every year. I mean, they’re great because we had some great four years. We had it done. All they had to do is leave what we had, but they didn’t want to do that.
(54:10)
But the Border Patrol endorsed me and endorsing me, they said, “She is the worst there has ever been.” She’s not going to be allowed to destroy our country like she destroyed San Francisco and like she destroyed California. And you see what’s happening there. Everybody does and everyone knows it. But no one respects her. No one trusts her. No one takes her seriously.
(54:36)
From humiliating our country in Afghanistan with Crooked Joe to the war in Ukraine to the nightmare on our border, to her inflation catastrophe, to her egregious hurricane response, which was worse maybe than even Katrina, Kamala Harris is a train wreck who has destroyed everything in her path. To make her president would be to gamble with the lives of millions of people. She would get us into a World War III guaranteed because she is too grossly incompetent to do the job. She’s not going to be able to deal with President Xi or Putin or Kim Jong Un or anybody. And then all of your sons and daughters will end up getting drafted to go fight for a war in a country that you’ve never heard of.
(55:24)
Our enemies are laughing at her. They’re laughing at us. But if we win, our enemies won’t be laughing anymore, I tell you. They’re not going to be laughing anymore. They’re not going to be laughing. Viktor Orban, he’s the head of Hungary, a very powerful man, very strong man. They said, “You bring back Trump, you’re not going to have any more problems.” When he was president, we didn’t have any problems.
(55:49)
Now, I wouldn’t use this term, but he did. He said, “China feared him. They were afraid of him. Russia feared him. They were afraid of him.” Look what I did to Russia. I ended Nord Stream 2. Nobody ever heard of Nord Stream 2. Nord Stream 2 was a pipeline that covered all of Europe. I said, “You mean we’re protecting you through NATO and you’re giving them billions of dollars a month for their energy? That’s no good.” I ended it, boom. When Biden came in he approved it. And then they say, “Oh, Trump was very friendly with Putin.” No, no. Putin would say, “This is not a great friendship.” But I had a relationship. And they’re a nuclear country, so are we. And I’m going to get that war settled because millions of people are being killed. Far more people are being killed in that war than you think. October 7th would’ve never happened with Israel. Think of it. All those people would be alive. October 7th, it was a carnage.
(56:45)
If we win, America will be feared and respected again. But we’re not just running against Kamala. She means nothing actually. She’s purely a vessel. Has to be, right? You saw her on the town hall the other night with Allison Cooper. Did you see? This is Allison Cooper of CNN. No. Allison interviewed her. She couldn’t answer a question. She couldn’t. She was terrible. We can’t have that running our country. She can’t put two sentences together. Just like we were not running against Crooked Joe Biden. We weren’t running against Biden. We’re running against something far bigger and more powerful than them. They took his job away. They walked into his office and they just said, “You’re not going to be president anymore.” He went through the system. And I guess I’ll use their term, they were a threat to democracy. Right? They took his president… They said, “You’re out.” How about that? Crazy Nancy and a few people, they just said, “You’re out.”
(57:58)
But it’s a big machine, which is a massive, vicious, crooked, radical left group of people that runs today’s Democrat Party. They’re vicious. They’re smart. They’re way left. They’re communists, probably. Remember I said, “We will never be a socialist country,” right? Remember? Because I like to say I was right about everything. I was right. We skipped socialism. We went down to communism. I mean, right? I think that’s… Oh, “He’s saying it.” The man down here is saying it.
(58:33)
But this is the real group that we’re fighting. We’re fighting a group of, like an amorphous group of people that seem to be invisible, but they’re not invisible. These are the people who are doing such harm to our country with their open borders policies, record-setting inflation, the Green New Scam for $93 trillion. They want every building in Manhattan to not have windows anymore because they think it’s environmentally friendly. It’d be very interesting. How do you sell an apartment? Let’s see. I want to buy a beautiful apartment. It’s got no windows, but it’s environmentally friendly. No, these are sick people. But we’re not going to let this bullshit happen any longer.
(59:17)
We’re going to have the biggest victory in the history of our country on November 5th, and we are going to make America great again. And we’re going to do it fast. On top of it all, Kamala says she would do nothing differently from Joe Biden. She said it. “No, no. I would do nothing differently.” We lost 325,000 children. Do you know that? Think of it. You never hear it from the fake news. They talk about it. They don’t talk about the Afghanistan travesty. We lost 325,000 children. They’re either dead, probably never be found again, sex slaves or slaves. And they were brought into our country through her open border. 325,000. That’s big stadiums filled up many, many times. Take a look at this, please.

Speaker 33 (01:00:16):

Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?

Kamala Harris (01:00:22):

There is not a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 34 (01:00:24):

I stood there on the tarmac watching you check your watch.

Speaker 35 (01:00:27):

The chaotic and deadly US evacuation from Afghanistan stunned Americans and the world and cost the lives of 13 US soldiers.

Speaker 33 (01:00:35):

Would you have done something differently?

Kamala Harris (01:00:37):

There is not a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 36 (01:00:39):

More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder have been caught at the border and then released into the United States.

Speaker 37 (01:00:46):

An Afghan national is in custody today after being accused of plotting an election day terrorist attack. The suspect entered the US on a special immigrant visa.

Speaker 38 (01:00:54):

Gut-wrenching new details in the murder of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley. The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuelan national who crossed the unsecured southern border back in 2022.

Speaker 39 (01:01:07):

Two men, investigators say, are in the country illegally from Venezuela are charged with capital murder in the death of Jocelyn Nungaray.

Speaker 40 (01:01:13):

A fifth illegal immigrant accused of attacking two New York City police officers over the weekend showed no remorse or regret.

Speaker 33 (01:01:21):

Would you have done something differently?

Kamala Harris (01:01:23):

There is not a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 41 (01:01:26):

Only 18% say the economy is in excellent or good condition.

Speaker 42 (01:01:29):

US inflation has hit a new 40-year high, increasing by 9.1% over the financial year.

Speaker 43 (01:01:36):

Authorities say Tren de Aragua, which has been linked with more than a hundred criminal investigations here in the US, has now been found operating its criminal enterprise in apartment complexes.

Speaker 44 (01:01:46):

Were you the last person in the room?

Kamala Harris (01:01:48):

Yes.

Donald Trump (01:01:51):

So you get the picture. You get the picture. It’s not a pretty one. Pennsylvania, if you want to end this disaster, you must get out to vote. Everybody here. I appreciate the ones that voted, but just get out to vote. And you can start by also voting for David McCormick. He’s a great gentleman. He’s a great gentleman. I told him to go and make another speech. He’s making a speech. I said, “I will represent you.” This guy is a winner. He was a wrestler too. He wasn’t as good as these guys, but who is? Not too many people I don’t think. But he was a wrestler. He was very successful in business, in school. He was top of the line. He was the top of everything. And he’s running against a guy that doesn’t do a damn thing. He’s been there forever. And David McCormick is really fantastic.
(01:02:45)
We’re also pleased to be joined today by Congressman Glenn “GT” Thompson, who’s a winner. A champion. He’s a champion. Thank you very much, Glenn. Thank you. Great job you do. And another one, another great patriot. He loves the Commonwealth, he loves the country, Congressman John Joyce. Thank you, John. Thank you, Mayor.
(01:03:15)
And a woman very respected in Washington and everywhere she goes, frankly. She’s on the strong side. I want to say strong. She’s a strong person, got a strong personality. But isn’t that a good thing? We need some of that. But she’s a very, very special person. And she’s really a very good person too. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Marjorie Taylor Greene.
(01:03:37)
And we have some special people because I really respect winners. So do you. We’d like to have a couple of them leading our country. Wouldn’t that be nice? But we like to have winners. And we have with us a team that won like 11 out of the last 13 national championships. And they’re the current national champion. They are the USA national champions in wrestling. And I would like to ask them, I don’t know if this platform can hold them, because that’s a lot of muscle. You know, muscle is much heavier than fat. They tell me fellas, is that right? But I’d love to have the team come up here and we can just say hello to them. These guys are something. Wow. That’s a lot of muscle. That’s great, fellas. Wow. Wow, that’s great.
(01:04:47)
Bo Nickal is a friend of mine, fellas. Do you know Bo? You know Bo, right? He’s going up there in December or November, right after the election actually. It’d be very interesting. But he’s a winner. He’s a champ. Come on up, fellas. Look at these guys. Look at these guys. So you don’t know, to win a national championship is great, but to do it like

Donald Trump (01:06:00):

… Like them and another friend of yours, I guess. Most of you are very close to him. It hasn’t been that long. Bo Nickal, right? He’s fighting a big one in November, right after the election. I said, maybe I’ll go. If I win, I’ll go. If I don’t win, I think I’ll be too depressed to go. I don’t think I’ll go. He’s a great guy. Would somebody like to come up? Who’s the biggest? Who’s got the best mouthpiece?

Speaker 45 (01:06:34):

Pleasure. I’m a little shorter than Mr. President here, but it truly an honor to be here. Thank you for recognizing us and Pennsylvania’s a super important state. We had to win this election and let’s make America great again. Go vote.

Donald Trump (01:07:36):

Incredible achievement. Really, best in the nation, best anywhere. I was just thinking maybe they could take over the gang, they could knock the hell out of those guys. They would have, they’re the only guys in the room that could do that, I could tell you. What a great job, fellas. What an achievement that is to be a national champion many times over and with all the competition, a lot of competition in that sport too so it’s a great honor to have them here.
(01:08:07)
Here are the facts on Kamala. Hard to believe we have to go from them to this one here, Kamala. She’s a radical left Marxist rated even worse than crooked Bernie Sanders or Pocahontas. You know who Pocahontas is? She destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of the Defund the Police movement, which means that anybody who wants to defund the police, even for a day, should never be worthy of being President of the United States because the concept is so bad.
(01:08:40)
Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE. ICE are very tough people. Even they would respect ICE, but they’re tough and they get the bad ones out. They took out thousands of MS-13 gang members. They’re very tough cookies, but they love our country and they’ve done a job. She wants to defund them. She wants to get them out.
(01:09:03)
As California Attorney General, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon, and rape of an unconscious person as a nonviolent crime. She pledged to confiscate your guns. She wants to confiscate your guns. Would anybody like to willingly give up their gun to Kamala? Well, she’ll do it because that’s for her whole life now. She just changed that a little while ago because it wasn’t working too well with her election. She’s a radical left person.
(01:09:34)
Look, she’s a radical left lunatic, and that’s what you have and now you know her. She went through the honeymoon period. She changed 15 different policies on her, like transgender. Oh, no, I’m so not. No, her whole life she wanted that. She thinks operations are wonderful. To transition a man to a woman is a wonderful thing and without parental consent yet, this is a wonderful thing. Now, if she believed that even for a day you don’t want to have her because it’s in there somewhere deep inside, right?
(01:10:10)
She endorsed a total ban on handgun ownership. She even called for free sex changes for illegal aliens that are held in detention at taxpayer expense.
(01:10:23)
As you know, did you see the little skit that turned out to be a monster when I went to McDonald’s a few days ago? I actually got a call from Sundar. Sundar, who’s great, from Google. He’s a great guy, very smart, the head of Google. He said, sir, I just want to tell you what you did with McDonald’s was one of the single biggest events we’ve ever had at Google. He said, I don’t know how the hell that happened, but it was, it went crazy. I did it. It was just a little throw away and I just wanted to highlight. I didn’t know it was going to blow up like that. You never know what’s going to happen in life, do you? You never know. You never really know.
(01:11:08)
By the way, watch Joe Rogan if you want. He did a little interview. Did you like the Joe Rogan? Everyone sees it. I did that to highlight the fact that a big part of her resume was that she worked, oh, she worked so hard at McDonald’s. She stood over the french fries. That’s what I was doing, making french fries. I’ll tell you, those things are damn good when you get them before they get cold. I stood over the french fries because I wanted… I was there for about 15 minutes, which meant I was there for 15 minutes longer than her because she never worked at McDonald’s. She lied. On top of all of this, she wants to make our military woke. I don’t think so. Just take a look.

Speaker 46 (01:11:58):

You little scumbag. I’ve got your name, I’ve got your ass. You will not laugh, you will not cry. You’ll learn by the number.

Speaker 51 (01:12:13):

Happy pride. Happy pride month. And actually let’s declare it a summer of pride.

Speaker 46 (01:12:18):

So you’re a killer?

Speaker 47 (01:12:19):

Sir, yes, sir.

Speaker 46 (01:12:19):

Let me see your war face.

Speaker 47 (01:12:19):

Sir.

Speaker 46 (01:12:22):

You’ve got a war face? Ah, that’s a war face. Now let me see your war face. Bullshit. You didn’t convince me. Let me see your real war face.

Speaker 48 (01:12:33):

Padam, I hear it and I know. Padam, padam, I know you want to take.

Speaker 46 (01:12:41):

You will be a weapon, you’ll be a minister of death praying for war. But until that day, you are puke. You are the lowest form of life on earth. You are not even human fucking being. You are nothing but unorganized grabastic pieces of amphibian shit.

Speaker 49 (01:12:59):

How to abracadabra these bitches. Know I got answers the way I…

Speaker 46 (01:13:04):

To me the best part, you ran down to cracking your mother’s ass and ended up as a brown stain on the mattress.
(01:13:07)
I love working for Uncle Sam.

Speaker 50 (01:13:07):

I love working for Uncle Sam.

Speaker 46 (01:13:07):

Lets me know just who I am.

Speaker 50 (01:13:08):

Lets me know just who I am.

Speaker 46 (01:13:14):

One, two, three, four, United States Marine Corps.

Speaker 50 (01:13:27):

One, two, three, four, United States Marine Corps.

Donald Trump (01:13:38):

We won two World Wars and let me tell you, we’re not woke. These guys aren’t woke. A couple of the stupid people we have at the top. Guys like Milley, General Milley and Mattis. These guys are lightweights, but we have the real deal. We defeated ISIS, knocked out the ISIS Caliphate in its totality. The fact that we were even thinking about anybody, everybody was peaceful with us because they know how good our military is. You could put them in a woke cage for two years and they’d come out fighting. Went out woke and they never would be woke. Just a few people on the top and they don’t really matter much anymore.
(01:14:17)
In conclusion, with your vote this November, we are going to fire Kamala and we are going to save America.
(01:14:29)
With your support, we will cut your taxes, end inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages, and bring thousands of factories back to America and back to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We will build American, we will buy American, and we will hire American. I will end the war in Ukraine very rapidly. Would’ve never started if I were president. Should have never started. Should have never started, a horrible war. I will stop the chaos in the Middle East and I will prevent World War III from happening. We’re very close to World War III. We’ve never been so close.
(01:15:08)
We will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources, and respect that they so dearly deserve. They deserve this. They have to have that respect. We have to give them back the honor and the respect that they deserve.
(01:15:25)
We will strengthen and modernize our military. I rebuilt the military, but we’re going to now do upgrades. We will build a missile defense shield above our country, all over our country, and much of it will be made in Pennsylvania.
(01:15:40)
We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington, D.C. making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. We will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. I’m going to put in legislation immediately upon getting to Washington that makes it an absolute penalty to burn our American flag. One year in prison, one year. If you want to burn our American flag, you go to prison for one year. I looked at what happened two months ago in Washington D.C. with the horrible scene. They were burning flags all over the place and spraying spray paint on beautiful limestone. Beautiful limestone, but that’s my business. Real estate, look, limestone sucks in, it sucks in the paint. You’ll see that limestone, you’ll see that paint a hundred years from now. They were spray-painting the beautiful lions at the main entrance to a magnificent building. You burn our flags, one year in prison. They say it’s unconstitutional, but I can’t believe that.
(01:17:02)
We will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools and immediately. We will keep men out of women’s sports.
(01:17:19)
I will defend religious liberty, I will restore free speech, and I will defend the right to keep and bear arms. That’s your Second Amendment.
(01:17:29)
After years of building up foreign nations, defending foreign borders, and protecting foreign lands, we are finally going to build up our country, defend our borders, and protect our citizens maybe for a change. We will stop illegal immigration once and for all. It will be ended. You can come into our country, but you have to come in legally.
(01:17:56)
We will not be invaded, we will not be occupied, we will not be overrun, we will not be conquered. We will be a free and proud nation once again. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope and loaded up with the American dream.
(01:18:19)
But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda with a landslide that is too big to rig. Early voting is underway. Get everyone you know out there. All those people that raise their hands, please get out and vote. You got to vote. All the people that didn’t have to raise their hand, we really appreciate it. We really do because we’re going to have the biggest victory maybe in the history of our country. This could be the biggest in the history of our country.
(01:18:51)
After all we’ve been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of America. With your help, from now until election day, nine days, we will restore America’s promise. We will put America first and we will take back the nation that we love.
(01:19:12)
We’ve been on this journey now for nine years together. We’ve had the greatest rallies in the history of our country. It’s the greatest movement in the history of our country. It’s now coming to an end as we know it. It’s coming to an end. In one way it’s sad and another way it’s beautiful. I think it’s going to come to a very successful end and then a new period begins and that’s the next four years where we’re going to make our country so incredible and we’re going to do it so fast.
(01:19:47)
There’ll never be rallies like this, there’ll never be. In four years there’ll be somebody come in and they’ll call for a rally and they’ll have 200 or 300 people. There’s never been anything like this. Not in history and it’s a great tribute to you and the love that you have for this country and I will never forget it. I will never forget it.
(01:20:09)
Now we have to finish it off. We have to finish it off with a big victory on November 5th. The biggest, I believe it’ll be the biggest political event in the history of our country. That’s how big it’s going to be. Remember, we will be a nation in decline no longer from the day that happens.
(01:20:32)
We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. We will never give in, we will never give up, we will never, ever back down and we will never surrender. Together we will fight, fight, fight and win, win, win. November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country and together we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you Pennsylvania. God bless you all. Good luck fellas. Have a good life. Great people, thank you. Thank you everybody. Thank you.

We come before you today seeking your divine wisdom and guidance. Lord, we recognize that true wisdom comes from you alone. Help us to discern your will in our lives, especially in these challenging times for our beloved nation. May we seek to honor you not just with our words, but through our actions each and every day. Father, we ask for a deep-rooted love for America in our hearts. We thank you for blessing us all to live in the United States of America. We thank you for our Founding Fathers who, by your guidance, set the framework for our republic. We thank you for the people in attendance here today who love this country and ask you to protect it.
(00:48)
We thank you, God, for our public servants and leaders who have heeded the call for a greater good and place themselves in the service of the citizenry to protect and defend the constitution of the United States of America. Let us remember that this great land was built on the foundations of faith, hope, and love. May we strive to embody these values, shining your light in our communities and beyond. As we face the coming days, grant us the strength to stand firm in our beliefs and to act with integrity, reflecting your grace in every choice we make. We also lift up our leaders, especially President Trump. We pray for every candidate from school board all the way to the Oval Office.
(01:38)
Give them the wisdom, conviction, courage, and victory. We thank you for hope. We thank you for modern day miracles. We all watched you spare President Trump from an assassin who will go down in history as a failure while we give you the credit and honor for protecting this man who has promised to fight, fight, fight for the United States, surround him with your protection and strength, Lord. Equip him with the wisdom needed to lead with the courage, stamina, compassion, and discernment that America needs right now. May he be filled with your spirit, making decisions that align with your purpose and that serve the best interests of all Americans. Our hearts are hurting. We hurt watching our children suffer. We see them being led astray in our schools. We mourn as they’re abused, manipulated, and indoctrinated to accept lies instead of truth. Help us to be joyful warriors as we fight fiercely for them and their future.
(02:43)
We are fighting to raise them as they should go. We fight through persecution but we will not be stopped. Help us to be strong, joyful warriors as we fight for their future. We pray for safety and civility in our country. We yearn to return to a nation united in love for one another, not divided by hate and division. Finally, we ask for you to bless our country with faithful leaders. We pray for the candidates here today that they will gain victory in the polls. That voters will vote for these good men and women of integrity by a resounding margin. Be with our election workers. Bless us with a safe and fair election. We pray that as our people go to the polls, that you will deliver us a victory so great and wonderful that all will be amazed at the work of your hand.
(03:37)
We also thank you for what you’re going to do in our future as we continue to serve you. Together, let us commit to praying for our country and acting in ways that glorify you. Thank you for being willing to forgive those who ask for forgiveness and to use every single person to work for you for good. May our lives be a testimony of your love and truth, inspiring others to turn towards you. We thank you for hearing our prayers and we trust in your perfect plan. We pray and ask for all of this in your heavenly name. Amen.

I stood there on the tarmac watching you check your watch.

Speaker 6 (10:42):

The chaotic and deadly US evacuation from Afghanistan stunned Americans and the world and cost the lives of 13 US soldiers.

Speaker 4 (10:50):

Would you have done something differently?

Kamala Harris (10:52):

There is not a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 7 (10:54):

More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder have been caught at the border and then released into the United States.

Speaker 8 (11:02):

An Afghan national is in custody today after being accused of plotting an election day terrorist attack. The suspect entered the US on a special immigrant visa.

Speaker 9 (11:09):

Gut-wrenching new details in the murder of Georgia nursing student Lake O’Riley. The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuelan national who crossed the unsecured southern border back in 2022.

Speaker 10 (11:22):

Two men investigators say are in the country illegally from Venezuela are charged with capital murder in the death of Jocelyn Nungarei.

Speaker 11 (11:29):

A fifth illegal immigrant accused of attacking two New York City police officers over the weekend showed no remorse or regret.

Speaker 4 (11:37):

Would you have done something differently?

Kamala Harris (11:39):

There is not a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 12 (11:41):

Only 18% said the economy is in excellent or good condition. US inflation has hit a new 40-year-high, increasing by 9.1% over the financial year.

Speaker 13 (11:51):

Authorities say Tren de Aragua, which has been linked with more than a hundred criminal investigations here in the US has now been found operating its criminal enterprise in apartment complexes.

Speaker 4 (12:02):

Were you the last person in the room?

Kamala Harris (12:03):

Yes.

Speaker 2 (12:09):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage comedian, roaster, and host of the Kill Tony podcast, Tony Hinchcliffe.

MUSIC (12:18):

Bitch, I’m from Texas. Where we still ride in swangas and put diamonds in our necklace.
(12:34)
Pour drank inside my lemonade ’til it look like a Pepsi.
(12:36)
See, I come from the D where we got shags and we be flexin’.
(12:41)
If you ain’t from my state.
(12:42)
Then you should know-

Tony Hinchcliffe (12:43):

Madison Square Garden. How we feeling, huh? Wow. Isn’t this special? 17 years ago, I was sleeping in my car behind the Comedy Store in LA and I’m proud to say this is my fourth time performing at Madison Square Garden in the most famous arena in the damn world, the American dream alive and well right here. This is very different than where I’m used to performing though. I’m used to nighttime with people drinking, not so many babies in the crowd and people that are obviously only here for Lee Greenwood tonight. Normally, I don’t make my political beliefs a known thing. It’s divisive for a comedian to do that, but just know I sleep well at night knowing who I’m voting for.
(13:38)
Yeah, when I lay down and my head hits my My Pillow, it is a fantastic pillow by the way. I was staying at the four Seasons up by Central Park one night and I laid my head down and it felt so good and I thought to myself, what an amazing pillow. I have a little bit of money now. I could buy a good pillow and I took the pillowcase off and there it was. My pillow, my pillow, my pillow, and damn it, I bought four of them, and if you use the promo code Kill Tony, you can also buy four My Pillows.
(14:20)
There’s serious stuff happening, people. I live in the great state of Texas now, 18 years in Ohio, 20 years in California, and I got to see California turn to absolute horrendous, horrendous thing. And traveling the world, I got to see San Francisco turn into one of the most demented cities, one of the greatest downfalls I’ve ever seen, and that is where the other candidate worked for two decades and it’s absolutely wild to see. And in Texas, stuff is really, really crazy. We’re right there by a wide-open border. Where are my proud Latinos at tonight? You guys see what I mean? It’s wide open. There’s so many of them. It’s absolutely incredible. Believe it or not, people, I welcome migrants to the United States of America with open arms. And by open arms, I mean like this. It’s wild. And these Latinos, they love making babies too. Just know that. They do. They do. There’s no pulling out. They don’t do that. They come inside, just like they did to our country. Republicans are the party with a good sense of humor. Free speech is under attack people. I host a show and each week I get updates what words we’re allowed to use and not use anymore. It’s happening right now the past few years. It’s a real thing and used to be able to tell people to Google stuff. My mom’s a boomer in the state of Ohio and there’s no convincing her of anything. She’s eating the cats, she’s eating the dogs.
(16:14)
They’re eating the pets up there. It is absolutely wild times. It really, really is, and there’s a lot going on. I don’t know if you guys know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. Yeah, I think it’s called Puerto Rico. Okay. All right. Okay. We’re getting there. Now again, normally I don’t follow the national anthem everybody. This isn’t exactly a perfect comedy setup. There’s some people here. All right, very good. I like it.
(16:52)
I have other policies that I think should be implemented as well. Like me personally, I think football should be all year round. Yeah, so many great athletes. I don’t know about you guys, but I think that Travis Kelce might be the next OJ Simpson. Feels good in here. The other side’s got a lot of crazy endorsements. Swift, M&M, Leo DiCaprio, Beyonce. Every day the Democratic Party looks more and more like a P Diddy party. Oh, okay. Okay. That’s what you guys want. All right. Heck yeah. That’s cool. Black guy with a thing on his head. What the hell is that? A lampshade? Look at this guy. Oh, my goodness.
(17:49)
Wow. I’m just kidding. That’s one of my buddies. He had a Halloween party last night. We had fun. We carved watermelons together. It was awesome. You guys are… This is a groany little morning crowd, huh? It’s tough to follow this audition for the next Commissioner Gordon’s over here. It is though. It’s crazy times we’re living in. I mean, all these pointless wars. It is unbelievable what’s happening right now. It is incredible. Ukraine versus Russia, Israel. It’s like bad soccer games. Who even cares? What are we doing? Why is our money involved in these wars?
(18:36)
When it comes to Israel and Palestine, we’re all thinking the same thing. Settle your stuff already. Best out of three. Rock, paper, scissors. You know the Palestinians are going to throw rock every time, but you also know the Jews have a hard time throwing that paper. You know what I’m saying? All right, we’re having fun now. We’re cooking.
(19:07)
Hillary Clinton said that this is a Nazi rally here today. Can you believe that? For the most anti-war president of my entire lifetime, and she calls him Hitler. Let me remind you, Hillary, it was your husband who shot innocent people or as he called them interns? Yeah, Hillary. I bet you did not see that one coming. By the way, if I commit suicide in three weeks, I didn’t. I mean, it’s just obvious to me who the right candidate is. There’s a guy out here dodging bullets. It is unbelievable, right? He took it right in the ear. Unbelievable. I thought about this. I don’t know if you have coolest place to get shot, if you’re going to get shot anywhere on your body, that’s where you want it. Right there. Technically, he got shot in the head depending on if you’re a Democrat or a Republican, right? If you’re a Democrat, his ear was grazed.
(20:38)
If you’re a Republican, he survived a head shot. It is. It’s the best place to get shot. It’s the only part of the human body will drive a piercing through a little girl’s ear for no reason, right? There’s just no… Heals fast. Nobody cares. It’s the best place to get shot. He went down, saw blood on his hands, I’d imagine he thought right then, I think I just won this shit. Stands up and says the most American words I’ve ever heard in my life. No, no, no, no. Before that, there was one more. Let me get my shoes. Fearless. Perhaps still with an active shooter, he’s talking like a guy that just had the best one night stand of his life, right? Where’s my shoes at? I got to get the hell out of here. Let me get my shoes. And then the fight, fight, fight. What he did was so cool that Biden got COVID. Oh, yeah. Go back. Look at the timeline of everything again. Three days after that. That means Biden, he didn’t get that from hanging out with sick people. He was in a sterile room in the White House watching blood running down Trump’s face as he pumps his fist. Biden’s like, “Oh God, no.” It’s true. Trump survived an assassination attempt and Biden got COVID. We vote next week. God voted three months ago. Another great Austin, Texas resident, Elon Musk will be speaking here later today. Unbelievable. Genius. You guys saw him shoot that rocket in the outer space. The largest aircraft ever, fires it off in this space and then parallel parks it back to planet Earth. Meanwhile, Kamala supporters can’t parallel park their Toyota Priuses properly.
(23:13)
Sorry. I listen to Elon Musk, I follow his lead. The world’s smartest, richest man has my attention, except for when it comes to stock trading. Then I listen to Nancy Pelosi, but censorship is amongst us people. It’s a very, very, very big deal and I’m just here to say that you guys are for the right candidate. Tell your friends, let’s close it out and let’s make speech free again. Make America healthy again. Let’s beat the team from California. The team from New York should beat the team from California, not only in this election, but in the World Series of baseball, America’s sport. I love you New York. God bless New York. God bless America. Let’s make it great again. I love you. Thank you. Welcome.

Ladies and gentlemen, before we bring up our next speaker, please bring your attention to the video screens.

For spacious [inaudible 00:24:57].

Speaker 14 (25:02):

11 old girl shot in the face because of woke 2011 District Attorneys.

Speaker 15 (25:10):

This is a street performance. Seems like all the artists activists are on the left, except for Scott Lobaido.

Scott Lobaido (25:16):

I do not conform to the elitist isms of the art clubs and they have nothing like a redheaded stepchild. This is my medium in which I shall create, and this is my canvas. The front of the Brooklyn Museum. The first most important thing in school or anyone else, is the Pledge of Allegiance. This is not a pro-war protest. This has to do with the increasing level of anti-Americanism.
(25:44)
They don’t keep the criminals in jail. They’re not going to keep you in jail. This line is to show respect and honor to those who died, got shot in the (beep) shot in the head protecting us. You try to take that (beep) blue line down, I’ll paint it till the day I die.
(26:01)
When the towers came down, there was absolutely no doubt that feeling, so sorry, it was going to change my life and it did. When somebody’s complaining, it’s so cold out, the traffic, and here I am drinking with one of these guys who’s got one arm. He’s got a hook for another arm and he’s drinking a (beep) beer, having a laugh with me, and he’s not bitching about nothing.

Speaker 16 (26:26):

I present to you the recipient of this Year’s VFW Americanism Award, Mr. Scott Lobaido.

Scott Lobaido (26:35):

That’s it. I want to paint a flag on a rooftop in every state near a military base.

Speaker 17 (26:39):

As a veteran, we all fought for that flag in World War II, and today we want to see it flying.

Scott Lobaido (26:48):

They will never, as long as I am alive, they will never take the American flag down. You want to burn one? Then I will find out where you work and I will find a building across the street and paint a flag 50 by a hundred, so you have to see it every (beep) day.

Speaker 18 (27:10):

A pro-Trump sign on the front lawn of a Staten Island home was burned to the ground.

Scott Lobaido (27:15):

The hate I get is astronomical. If everybody liked me, I’d been doing something wrong. My mother’s advice, whatever you’re doing with your life, as long as you believe it in your heart and always take care of those less fortunate. My father’s advice was, son, take (beep) from nobody.

MUSIC (27:41):

[inaudible 00:27:35] about control and division. We must unite. We must take a stand. Are you ready?
(27:44)
Left, left, left, right, left.

Scott Lobaido (27:49):

God didn’t give me a gun and a bayonet. He gave me paint and a brush and I will fight to the (beep) death for this country.

Speaker 2 (28:04):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage artist Scott Lobaido to do a live painting.

Scott Lobaido (28:32):

Before I create some art. I got to say this, there’s a lot of creative conservatives out there who’ve been in the closet all these years. I came out of that closet 40 years ago and I got a lot of hell for it, but now you creative conservatives, it’s a new world. Come out of the closet and get the balance back.
(28:57)
Back in the 90s, I came to Manhattan to find my niche in the art world and the art world didn’t like me because I came from this place called Staten Island. Do I hear Staten Island in the house? The art world didn’t like me because I like God, girls, and guns. The art world didn’t like me because I refused to succumb to the America-hating isms of their agenda and they said I’d never make it in their world. Fast-forward 35 years, I’m standing on the greatest stage in the world, in the greatest city in the world, in the greatest country in the world, and I’m opening up for the greatest fucking president in the world.
(29:55)
So before I create this piece of art, I would just like to give the art world a little something. I got it here somewhere. Oh, here it is. Bam. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you New York, New York.

Donald Trump (34:04):

This is the final battle. With you at my side, we will demolish the deep state, we will expel the warmongers from our government, we will drive out the globalists, we will cast out the communists, Marxists, and fascists, we will throw off the sick political class that hates our country, we will rout the fake news media, and we will liberate America from these villains once and for all.

Speaker 19 (34:36):

Trump’s just outside of a fire station after leaving court. He’s got pizza for the guys.

Speaker 20 (34:42):

Former President Trump always promised to deliver, and he did just that today. He handed out pizzas to members of both the New York Fire and Police Departments.

Speaker 44 (34:51):

This is the same fire station he visited in 2021 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks.

Speaker 20 (34:58):

He also visited the plaque that honors a Green Beret who was awarded the Medal of Honor during Trump’s presidency.

Speaker 21 (35:04):

They all love him, because they remember what America was like under Donald Trump.

Announcer (35:23):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage radio host Sid Rosenberg.

MUSIC (35:35):

Let freedom ring, let the white dove sing. Let the whole world know that today.
(35:35)
Is a day of reckoning.
(35:35)
Let the weak be strong, let the right be wrong.
(35:35)
Roll the stone away…

Sid Rosenberg (36:09):

Hey there, how are you? I guess I’ll start with this. I can’t fucking believe I’m Madison Square Garden with all you people. I’ve been in this building many, many times. I’ve seen Mark Messier score game-winning goals, Ron Duguay score game-winning goals, Patrick Ewing make big baskets. Too young to remember Clyde and Frazier. Same building, of course, with Muhammad Ali, Billy Joel, and Frank Sinatra. A building made of champions and all-time greats. But ladies and gentlemen, don’t confuse the issue. The greatest champion of all will be backstage in about an hour. He is the 45th and soon to be 47th president of the United States, the great Donald J. Trump. So, I just got back from Israel about two weeks ago. They love Trump in Israel, just so you know, they love him. They love him and Bibi, they love them both. I’m in Israel, and had the opportunity to break the Yom Kippur fast with Bibi Netanyahu. What an amazing night that was. Cried with Israelis in the streets. They listen to me from Jerusalem, they really do, just like all of you listen to me, all of you. I get back and they go, “Sid, you want to speak at this MSG thing?” I go, “Sure.” Out of character for me to speak at a Nazi rally, I was just in Israel, but I took the gig. She is some sick bastard, that Hillary Clinton, huh? What a sick son of a bitch. The whole fucking party, a bunch of degenerates, low lives, Jew haters and low lives. Every one of them. Every one of them.
(38:15)
Look at my city. Look at my city. Yes, this building is beautiful, you’re all beautiful, look at you. But you can’t walk outside past about 10 o’clock at night here. If you’re a pretty woman, like my beautiful wife Danielle out there somewhere, you get punched across the face just for walking down the street. Who did that? Bill de Blasio, Eric Adams, shitty Democrat mayors.

Crowd (38:42):

Boo!

Sid Rosenberg (38:42):

Andrew Cuomo, Kathy Hochul, shitty Democrat governors.

Crowd (38:46):

Boo!

Sid Rosenberg (38:51):

You got homeless and veterans, Americans, Americans sleeping on their own feces on a bench in Central Park. But the fucking illegals, they get whatever they want, don’t they? Five star hotels, cash, probably get Yankee Dodger tickets tomorrow night. That’s all about the Democrat rule, folks. Whether it’s blue cities, blue states, or a blue administration, there’s only one person alive today that can fix all of it. Look at all your signs. He can fix it. You’re damn right he can fix it. That’s President Donald J. Trump.
(39:45)
I said to my dad when I was a little kid, I was born in 1967, before John F. Kennedy was assassinated, I couldn’t understand, until Thurman Munson died, why grown men cried in the streets over Kennedy. And then they shot my friend President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. And I sat at the end of my bed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin before the RNC, and I cried. And all of a sudden, I knew what it meant to have a man like that. Scared the hell out of me. But as you’ve seen tonight already with just two speakers… And Muhammad Ali fought in this building, is there a greater fighter ever in the history of our country than the great Donald J. Trump?

Crowd (40:39):

Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

Sid Rosenberg (40:39):

Give me some of that, let’s go.

Crowd (40:40):

Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

Sid Rosenberg (40:46):

Come on, come on, come on.

Crowd (40:48):

Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

Sid Rosenberg (40:50):

Come on! Fight! Fight! Ladies and gentlemen, we’re nine days away.

Crowd (40:53):

Nine!

Sid Rosenberg (40:54):

Nine days away. It’s really very, very simple. Really very, very simple. As I wrap this up, I get less time than comedians and painters. I don’t know why. Nine days, it’s very simple. You want to get cities like New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta back? You want to get the great states like New York and California running like the United States used to run again? You want to get an administration that cares about the Jewish people, the American people, women, men, and certainly our armed services? There’s only one choice to make. In nine days, you fight, fight, fight, and you vote like your life depends upon it for our great president, President Donald J. Trump! So, before this thing is all said and done today, do me a big favor in New York City, show the world, New York, why we’re still… Hi Nicole Malliotakis. Why we’re still the greatest city in the world, and tear the fucking roof off this place!

MUSIC (42:28):

Wolf Blitzer (42:30):

We can now project the winner of the presidential race. Donald Trump wins the presidency. What started off as unlikely-

President Trump.

President Trump!

Speaker 25 (42:37):

Donald Trump (42:41):

I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never ever let you down.

Jeanine Pirro (42:50):

We have a president who actually fulfilled the promises he made-

Speaker 26 (42:53):

President Trump-

Jeanine Pirro (42:54):

… during the campaign.

Speaker 26 (42:55):

He now has a record as president that’s pretty damn impressive.

Speaker 28 (42:57):

Breaking news out of Palm Beach, Florida.

Speaker 29 (43:01):

The FBI has executed an unprecedented search warrant at President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate.

Speaker 30 (43:06):

… warrant against a former president has both sides of the political aisle up in arms.

Speaker 31 (43:09):

… is a dangerous and unstable moment in American history.

Speaker 32 (43:12):

The Justice Department has just indicted former President Donald Trump.

Speaker 33 (43:16):

For seven years, they hated him, they targeted him, they hunted him.

Bill Barr (43:20):

This is the epitome of the abuse of the prosecutorial power to preempt political decisions.

Donald Trump (43:25):

I never thought anything like this could happen in America. The only crime that I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it. The more that a broken system tells you that you’re wrong, the more certain you should be that you must keep pushing ahead. They want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom. They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you. They’re not coming after me, they’re coming after you, and I just happen to be standing in their way, and I will never be moving. On November 5th, 2024, justice will be done. We will take back our country, and we will make America great again. America will always rise to every challenge and overcome every danger.

Matthew Whitaker (44:23):

Donald Trump seems to always get stronger when challenged. These types of things, I think, give him strength.

Donald Trump (44:31):

When I’m re-elected, I will totally obliterate the deep state. As long as we have pride in our beliefs, courage in our convictions, and faith in our God, then we will not fail.

You see, I put my MAGA jacket to trigger Hillary Clinton. There you go, Hill. Are you ready to make history tonight and make some liberals cry? The world first got to know me on the courtroom steps right here in New York City, and they thought they could take the greatest president down through lawfare, with lawsuits, fake charges, raids, and endless investigations.

Crowd (46:56):

Boo!

Alina Habba (46:56):

They thought so, it’s okay. They thought they could crush the man who built this city skyline. But they underestimated how hard President Trump would fight, fight, fight.

Crowd (47:14):

Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

Alina Habba (47:20):

This rally has rattled some of my favorite swamp creatures. Hey, guys. They are now scrambling and trying to call us Nazis and fascists. And claiming-

Crowd (47:39):

Boo!

Alina Habba (47:40):

Yeah. And you know what they’re claiming, guys? It’s very scary. They’re claiming we’re going to go after them and try and put them in jail. Ain’t that rich? Kamala, you want to talk about a fascist? No one has ever voted for you to become the Democrat nominee.
(48:03)
You see, I believe in something called the Constitution. And I believe in someone called God. And they tried to keep President Trump and his campaign in courtrooms being persecuted. But do you know what he did while he was in those New York courtrooms? He won the hearts and minds of the American people all from this city. You see, the deep state, they underestimate how smart we are.

Crowd (48:57):

That’s right!

Alina Habba (48:58):

And they want the American people to fall in line, like a bunch of sheep.

Crowd (49:02):

We’re the wolf!
(49:02)
Baa!

Alina Habba (49:05):

You know what they don’t realize, New York?

Crowd (49:07):

We ain’t no sheep!

Alina Habba (49:08):

We’re going to be the ones herding sheep out of the White House on November 5th. Because Kamala Harris, you are getting evicted from my president’s house. Let’s not forget one thing. Kamala said she wouldn’t change a damn thing. And look, look, it’s okay. She must be proud of her records. She’s got a lot of them. Record inflation, record crime, and record boarding crossings, with over 325,000 children who are being sex trafficked, murdered, and missing. Those are the records you hold, Kamala.

Crowd (50:10):

Boo!
(50:10)
They are evil!

Alina Habba (50:12):

Look at my family, I love my family. Yeah, that’s my family right there. By the way, where’s my Trump Bedminster people? Let’s go, Trump.
(50:24)
Don’t get me started on my boy Tampon Tim. You know, Timmy, in the words of your wife, we are ready to “turn the page” on your indoctrination of our children, your tampons in boys’ bathrooms, your deadly fentanyl pouring into our country through your wide-open borders, and your inflation that is crippling hard-working American people. He claims to champion women, yet he pushes policies that under women every… Every single woman here. By the way, they can’t even define what the hell a woman is. Get the hell out of here. They think we’ll be fooled. That we’ll believe their empty promises, and be bribed with garbage like loan forgiveness, and policies that will cost this country, and my children’s America, trillions of dollars.
(51:41)
But we are smarter than that, New York. This is the party of strength, resilience, and a voice that echoes around the world. Our voices cannot be silenced, and this movement will not be stopped. So when Letitia James, Alvin Bragg, Jack Smith-

Crowd (52:08):

Boo!

Alina Habba (52:12):

… and the Harris-Biden administration came for my client, President Donald J. Trump, they didn’t just come for him, they came for us!
(52:29)
So, on November 5th, New York, we are going to right this ship. In nine days, you’ll make the choice for an America that works for we the people!

Crowd (52:43):

The people!

Alina Habba (52:44):

Not the powerful. So Nancy, it’s time to sell your stocks. Take the cabal packing! The Clintons and Obamas can get out of our White House, because America has had enough with you all. Bye now!
(53:17)
In nine days, it’s your turn to cast a vote for the man who’s been in the trenches with you. The man who gets back up every time they try and knock him down. They thought they could break us, they thought they could scare us, they thought they could jail us, and they thought they could kill him, but they don’t know what doesn’t break you makes you stronger. New York, let’s show them what we’re made of. Let’s take this all the way to the ballot box. Let’s stand tall for our president, for our city, and for our nation, because New York, we don’t just survive, we thrive. And on November 5th, Donald Trump will tell Kamala one very important thing.

Crowd (54:26):

You’re fired!

Alina Habba (54:26):

You are fired!

Crowd (54:26):

You are fired!

Alina Habba (54:39):

I will see you at the polls, let’s make history together. God bless New York, God bless the USA, and God bless the greatest president this country has ever seen, President Donald J. Trump.

MUSIC (54:58):

DJ Khaled! Hey!

Yeah, we the best!

All I do is win, win, win, no matter what, what.

Got money on my mind, I can never get enough.
(55:03)
And every time I step up in the building, everybody hands go up.
(55:03)
And they stay there, there.

And they say, “Yeah!”

Yeah!

And they stay there.

Up, down, up, down, up, down.

Yeah, listen, Luda!

Joe Biden (55:30):

The total initiative relative to what we’re going to do with more Border Patrol and more asylum officers.

Donald Trump (55:35):

I really don’t know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don’t think he knows what he said either. Kamala definitely covered up his cognitive decline, and it was a rapid decline.

Ted Cruz (55:46):

When Joe Biden and Kamala Harris came into office, they inherited peace and prosperity. All they had to do was nothing. Just not screw it up.

Kamala Harris (55:54):

I am radical. I do believe that we need to get radical.

Jim Jordan (55:57):

We went from safe streets to record crime.

Meghan McCain (55:59):

Are you for defunding the police?

Kamala Harris (56:00):

How are you defining “defund the police”?

Jim Jordan (56:02):

We went from $2 gas to $4 gas.

Erin Burnett (56:04):

Would you ban offshore drilling?

Kamala Harris (56:05):

Yes. There’s no question, I’m in favor of banning fracking.

Jim Jordan (56:08):

We went from stable prices to record inflation.

Speaker 34 (56:10):

They are killing us without killing us.

Kamala Harris (56:13):

That is called Bidenomics.

Speaker 35 (56:17):

The very first task that Joe Biden gave Kamala Harris was to be the border czar.

Speaker 36 (56:22):

Do you have plans to visit the border?

Kamala Harris (56:26):

Not today.

Donald Trump (56:28):

She’s not going to have any border security.

Ron Johnson (56:31):

I want a number. How many people have you let into this country?

John Kennedy (56:35):

Does anybody know? None of you know.

Vivek Ramaswamy (56:37):

We’re in the middle of a war in this country. It is a war between those of us who love the United States of America, and a fringe minority-

Protestors (56:43):

[inaudible 00:56:44].

Vivek Ramaswamy (56:44):

… who hates this country and what we stand for.

Kamala Harris (56:47):

We got to let people know who brung it to them.

Mark Halperin (56:50):

Raise your hand if you think President Trump’s policies on the economy would be better for your family. All right, so that is everybody.

Speaker 37 (57:04):

The chaotic and deadly US evacuation from Afghanistan stunned Americans and the world.

Dana Bash (57:09):

Afghanistan.

Kamala Harris (57:10):

Yes.

Dana Bash (57:11):

Were you the last person in the room?

Kamala Harris (57:12):

Yes.

Speaker 38 (57:13):

It was because of Kamala Harris’ failed leadership why you had people hanging off the airplanes.

Donald Trump (57:17):

When Putin saw how incompetent we were, he said, “Wow. I’m now going to go into Ukraine.”

Speaker 39 (57:23):

This is what Russian president Vladimir Putin unleashed on Ukraine.

Speaker 40 (57:27):

It’s almost like they intentionally tried to set the Middle East on fire.

Norah O’Donnell (57:30):

Hamas terrorists went door to door, slaughtering anyone they could find.

Donald Trump (57:34):

I’ll tell you what, we had a safe world. Now we have a very, very dangerous world. We’re going to get rid of these people that have destroyed our country.

Speaker 41 (57:43):

He’s doing this for one reason and one reason alone.

Speaker 42 (57:46):

It is a rescue mission for the American Dream.

Speaker 43 (57:49):

Trump’s rescue mission: saving America.

Donald Trump (57:52):

This is a rescue mission. We’re going to make America great again, greater than ever before.

Grant Cardone (58:38):

Thank you. Thank you so much.

MUSIC (58:38):

I was shaking at the knees.

Grant Cardone (58:41):

Hello, New York. How you guys doing? And to everybody that’s online right now, I guess you’re on the internet consuming content that Donald Trump has just literally taken control of the internet in the last five days here to finish. And that’s where this game will be won. My name’s Grant Cardone. I’m an educator, small business owner, and a real estate investor. And in February of this year, I came to this great city to make a real estate investment and had to discontinue the deal, because of a scumbag liberal judge coming out with a $454 million judgment against Donald Trump.

Crowd (59:41):

Boo!

Grant Cardone (59:44):

No, no, it needs to be bigger than that.

Crowd (59:45):

Boo!

Grant Cardone (59:49):

Because folks, here’s the deal. I’m telling my wife I have to cancel these deals. And she says, “Why?” I said, “Because if they can do this to a former president, a man that lived in this city, that built this skyline, what can they do to me?” What will they do to you? This one decision, by the way, will cost this city, the city of New York, hundreds of billions of dollars of lost tax revenues. Have you guys ever noticed, go to any of these blue, Democratic, liberal cities, have you noticed that where they go, everything is more expensive? Everything. For instance, New York City, you have the highest rents in the country. You have the highest home prices in the country. You have the highest food prices, the highest transportation, and the most crime. And your politicians want more taxes, not less. This is insanity, folks. Okay? Why do the politicians in blue cities want to raise your taxes? Because they live off your taxes. This is how they get paid. And that brings me to Timmy. Timmy and Kamala.

Crowd (01:01:07):

Boo!

Grant Cardone (01:01:11):

No, no, bigger than that, come on.

Crowd (01:01:13):

Boo!

Grant Cardone (01:01:15):

That’s what I’m talking about. They’re going to ruin this country, folks. You guys need to get angry right now, the country’s pissed. And I’m not here to invalidate them. The whole world can see their incompetence. They’re complete tools of the elites. They’re mere puppets.

Crowd (01:01:35):

Puppets!

Grant Cardone (01:01:37):

That’s right, puppets. And a little common sense. Who’s got a little common sense in the room? Just a little bit. And literally, the math of a five-year-old tells you that their policies don’t add up. Common sense. For one, she wants to add 87,000 employees to the IRS.

Crowd (01:02:00):

Boo!

Grant Cardone (01:02:06):

For what? 800 billionaires? That’s 1,000 employees for every billionaire. No, she’s here for your pockets, your money, your small business. She’s here to audit everybody in this room. She passed a $3 trillion Inflation Reduction Act that created inflation, didn’t reduce it. She promised to build three million homes in her first year. She’s never built one house in her damn lifetime. And at the same time, let 20 million homeless people, illegal immigrants, into a country that has a housing shortage.

Crowd (01:02:47):

Boo!

Grant Cardone (01:02:47):

Come on, man. It don’t make sense. She proposes 20 million people to get new businesses. She’s going to give tax money to fund 20 million new businesses, while we have 22 million small business owners in America that are breaking even or losing money. And lastly, the most insane of the insane, she wants to tax unrealized capital gains.

Crowd (01:03:16):

Boo!

Grant Cardone (01:03:19):

No, no, no, no. No, this is in… Complete gone. Not even her simp Mark Cuban can sell this. Even Marky-boy says this would destroy the global economy, and take the USA down with it.
(01:03:40)
Ladies and gentlemen, Kamala Harris is the least qualified candidate to ever run for any political office in American history. She makes her boss look competent. She’s a fake. I’m not here to invalidate her. She’s a fake, a fraud. She’s a pretender. Her and her pimp handlers will destroy our country. They will. They’ve already crippled the dollar, manufactured inflation, imported a virus, censored your voices, funded transgender surgeries, and made empty promises to the middle class for 50 years.

Crowd (01:04:34):

Boo!

Grant Cardone (01:04:34):

This election has to be more than a victory, it needs to be a landslide. We need to slaughter this other people. We need to bring 100 million votes to Donald Trump. Not 74, not 81, 100 million votes. Can you do it? Because if you bring 100 million votes to this man, you send this finger to the elites. And you say, “We are done. We are done. We are fed up. We have had enough.” He’s given everything. He’s given everything. It’s us in this room now that need to give the rest. We have to give everything for nine days, okay? That’s not just coming to rallies. It’s about putting a sign in your yard, a sticker on your car. It’s about donating money. You’ve got to give, folks, today while you’re here, everyone, $5, $10, $25. These elections cost money. If you do that, invest in this election, you will go down as a contributor that will make history. We will be in the history books 100 years from now. They will say,

Speaker 45 (01:06:00):

They will say in 2024, “Something happened in America. Something happened, a phenomenon, and it was galvanized around a bunch of people called MAGA.” The MAGA people! The MAGAs! That’s right, a MAGA! They will say it galvanized around people called MAGA and a man named Donald J. Trump. Thank you. God Bless America. Thank you.

Greatness doesn’t discriminate. It doesn’t see where you’re from, what you look like, or who you know. Greatness is for those who work for it, for those who keep moving forward. Greatness is for anyone willing to fight for it.

Brooke Rollins (01:08:29):

Hello New York City! Hello to all of you in America’s most iconic city, the city that gave us the man who gave up everything to serve his nation, the once and the future President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. Only in America would a little girl raised by a single mom from a tiny town called Glen Rose, Texas, ascend to work in the West Wing for the most consequential president of our lifetime. And only in America with that same small town Texas girl end up here in this incredible city with all of you at the world’s most famous arena. Let’s go! Tell me, tell me, tell me, who here loves President Donald Trump? Then you are at the right rally. A few days back, Kamala Harris heard someone at one of her rallies say, “Christ is Lord.” Let’s give it up. She said, you know what she said, “You are at the wrong rally, sir.”

Crowd (01:10:12):

Boo!

Brooke Rollins (01:10:17):

But, maybe for once in her life, Kamala Harris was right. They were at the wrong rally, because the rally where people believe in faith, believe in America and believe that we are one nation under God is right here. Is right here. So let me ask you what you believe, New York. Do you believe in America? You are at the right rally. Do you believe in the power of faith and that America needs God?

Crowd (01:11:02):

Yes!

Brooke Rollins (01:11:02):

You are at the right rally. Do you believe that America needs back the Trump economy where every American had a real chance at the American dream with jobs and homes and families and healthcare, where it works? Do you believe that, New York City? Do you believe that Americans deserve to be protected from illegal aliens who come into our communities, and the best way to do that is the largest deportation in American history. Do you believe that? Then you are at the right rally. Our way of life, our history and our inheritance are all at stake. We don’t mind standing on the line for Donald Trump because he is the one who taught us that one man plus the truth really is a majority, and we also understand what that means. It means everything.
(01:12:15)
Everything we have been, everything that was meant depends upon what happens right now. With just nine days left, on behalf of an over capacity, six times oversold, Madison Square Garden Arena, tens of millions, tens of millions of grateful patriotic Americans across this country, hundreds of millions of people across the world, I close today with this message to my friend, my mentor, my former boss. Mr. President, you put everything on the line for us, even your life, and you have always had our backs and now, it’s our turn. And we will deliver for you, Donald Trump. My friends, we are going to win. And when Donald J. Trump wins, America will win. Now, let’s go get our country back. God bless you, God bless America, and God bless Donald J. Trump. Thank you all so very much. Thank you.

(01:14:20)
Looking at the promise of the Promised Land…

Rudy Giuliani (01:15:21):

Thank you. Thank you very, very much, and welcome to the capital of the world. That’s not me, that comes from Pope John Paul when he came to New York and said, “This is the capital of the world.” No one could dispute it after that. New York City, this is the city I was the mayor of for eight years. Sitting over there is my police commissioner, Bernard Kerik, who saved my life on September 11 and when I was mayor, I need to remind people, the Yankees won four world championships! You think they need my help now? What the heck does Adams know about baseball? And de Blasio is so stupid, he doesn’t know about anything. Oh, for the good old days when I used to be able to sit at Yankee games with Donald Trump, and George Steinbrenner would make us pay for our peanuts.
(01:16:57)
No, he was a great friend of both of ours, and he shared in common with Donald Trump something that I know as the mayor that many people don’t know, and they probably don’t realize why he gets so angry when he’s attacked and demonized. This is a very charitable, very good man. Yeah, I know he was a great president, but this is a very good man. He and George Steinbrenner would step up anonymously every time a police officer not just killed, but hurt, every time a firefighter, not just killed, but hurt. Every time something horrible happened in the city, they would call, they would offer services, money, help, a hotel room. And when I wanted to make it public, they would say no because they said that, “You got to save that. The credit you get for that, you get from God. If you make too much of it here, it gets used up.” As the mayor…

Speaker 48 (01:18:32):

We love you, Rudy!

Rudy Giuliani (01:18:36):

Thank you. As the mayor, you know that I reduced crime more than any mayor in history. I improved the quality of life in five boroughs, I lowered taxes. It was the biggest tax reduction in New York history. Not like Donald Trump’s tax reduction, not as big. You know why it was the biggest? It was the only one. I was only the third Republican mayor in 100 years, and we carried out the biggest welfare-to-work program in the world. We had 1.3 million people on welfare. And when I turned over to the city to Mike Bloomberg, it was down to 500, 000, and almost all of them were working. That word working is anathema. It frightens Harris. It frightens Biden. It frightens the radical Democrats today. None of these people they’re giving money to, they require to work, because they don’t care about them, because they don’t love them.
(01:19:55)
Because what are they? They’re votes? Who cares if they don’t learn a trade or have a job? We gather here today in the middle of Midtown Manhattan, and this is the most iconic venue of venues in the United States. This is where a Republican’s not supposed to come, which is why Donald Trump came here. There’s no place in America the president shouldn’t be able to come. Remember New Palestine, remember New Palestine when they had their subway derailment? Place was horrible. People are still dying. He went there, I went there. I did my television show from there. It took Biden a year to go there because those people are deplorables! Like you, like me, we’re deplorables! We don’t count. The Hollywood stars count, the big money counts. 20 million from China counts. But we don’t count.

Crowd (01:21:14):

Boo!

Rudy Giuliani (01:21:23):

Just four miles from here, just four miles from here we had the worst terrorist attack in the history of our country. I’ll never, never forget that through all the pain and misery, we came together, places of worship, hundreds of funerals, praying to God. What’s happened to God? We don’t pray to him anymore? We’re not allowed to? We don’t bring God back, we don’t come back. September 11 was our darkest hour. October seven was Israel’s darkest hour. They are our best friend. I worked for Ronald Reagan for eight years. Ronald Reagan said, “We have to be there for Israel always because they are always there for us.” Hamas is not there for us, Iran is not there for us, they want to kill us! And the Palestinians are taught to kill us at two years old. They won’t let a Palestinian in Jordan, they won’t let a Palestinian in Egypt, and Harris wants to bring them to you.

Crowd (01:22:54):

Boo!

Rudy Giuliani (01:22:59):

They may have good people. I’m sorry, I don’t take a risk with people that are taught to kill Americans at two. I’m on the side of Israel. You’re on the side of Israel. Donald Trump’s on the side of Israel. And they’re on the side of the terrorists! Like me, President Trump grew up here. He’s a New Yorker. That’s why some people get a little annoyed at him. He speaks his mind. But wouldn’t you rather have a president that communicates with you than one who sits in a basement babbling, or another one who, when asked, “Why do you want to be president?” She says, “My mother was from the middle class, and I have [inaudible 01:24:15]…” Then CBS puts in something done by a Harvard PhD. “I want to be be president.” Even that was stupid, the one they put in, but at least it was in English.
(01:24:32)
In any case, maybe you don’t like what Donald Trump says sometimes, maybe you don’t agree with it, but I’ll tell you what, you always know what he’s thinking, and we need that from a president. He built a great empire here. He built a great real estate empire. He built some of the most iconic buildings in New York. That skyline wouldn’t be as beautiful without him. That’s enough for a man’s lifetime. That’s enough! He’s built some of the greatest golf courses in the world. He’s had and created for himself a privileged life. And here he is, here he is fighting 24 hours a day, twice almost murdered. Twice! And why is he doing it? For you, for me, to save our country. He saw that we were on the path of destruction and he couldn’t sit by. He saw that the backbone of America, the people that he grew up with, the laborers that he and his father used to build their business, are people they cared about, people they loved.
(01:25:52)
People say, “Well, how can this billionaire relate to regular people?” Because he is a regular person. His father taught him how to relate to everyone. [inaudible 01:26:10] I owe him $10. Now, they tried everything, right? Russian collusion, wrong conversation with the Ukrainian president. Oh my god, everything possible. Phony cases with perjury, and they committed so many crimes trying to get rid of him, using a false story to unseat a lawfully-elected president. And then they indicted him four times, and it had to stop. If they indicted him one more time, he’d have been elected by acclamation. And now I don’t know, I don’t know, I’m not going to do conspiracy and I’m not not going to do conspiracy. But it’s kind of funny that they tried everything else, and now they’re trying to kill him. They better not try again.
(01:27:19)
Donald Trump answered the question without a doubt as to who can lead us out of this morass of socialism, fascism, and communism that the Biden regime has put it in. He answered it, oh, in so many speeches and so many rallies, and in the great work that he did as president four years ago, I don’t have to ask you, “Are you better off now than you were four years ago?” There are a few people in a nuthouse who think they are. Otherwise, we all know, things cost more. Donald Trump gave them a world at peace. They’re giving us a world at war! He’d have been a great president, even if this didn’t happen. But on July 13th of this year, after he came this close to death, when he was down on the ground, he couldn’t possibly have any idea how bad it was. Within seconds he got up. Did he run away, did he hide, did he crawl? Did he appease the people who might have been attacking him?

No!

Rudy Giuliani (01:28:42):

He stood up and he thought about you, and me, but I was really worried about him. And then when we saw him say, “Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!”

Crowd (01:28:52):

Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!

Rudy Giuliani (01:28:56):

That’s the man to lead us, to lead us back to the America we love! Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln believed that every American, because it isn’t just Donald Trump, you got to do it, every American should take an oath to make this country better than it was handed to him or her. If I died now, I would break that oath, because America is not better today than it was when it was handed to me, or than it was four years ago. But in a few weeks, we get a chance to change that. I want every one of you right now, every single one of you, to say yes when I say this. Do you swear to make America better and greater by voting for Donald Trump and JD Vance? Now go do it! Fight!

Michael Harris (01:31:49):

Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Madison Square Garden, I got to thank God for allowing me to speak in front of you today. I got to tell you something else. God is great. Can I get a second? I got to tell you another secret, though. If it wasn’t for Donald Trump, I wouldn’t be standing here today. So I want to thank President Donald Trump for allowing me to stand in front of you here today. It’s a bigger story, got to let you know about it. God spoke to his heart and Donald Trump signed with his heart my release after 33 years. God spoke to his heart. So I don’t have but a few minutes, so I want to say what I got to say. First thing I want to do is speak to this elephant in the room. Our nation has had a complex history with racism and sexism, and we can all agree that we got to do a little work there, but that’s not what we are here to talk about today.
(01:33:11)
What we are here to talk about is our similarities that unite us. We want to talk about family security. It’s important. We want to talk about economic development. It’s essential. We want to talk about education for our children. It matters. It matters. For example, Kamala Harris talks about an opportunity agenda for Black men, but there is no opportunity unless you have the foundation that starts with a strong education. And we cannot allow our children’s zip code to dictate the opportunities for our children’s future. School choice is like the First Amendment of opportunity agenda. The rest of the Constitution can’t work if you don’t have the right enshrines in the First Amendment. That is why we created Community First, to promote economic self-sufficiency, to increase access to capital, to expand educational opportunities.
(01:35:15)
And in order to do this, we need a commander in chief that has the ability to bridge the gap with government, business, private sector, and our communities. Maybe I didn’t mention, I’m the founder of Community First. President Donald Trump has committed to working with community First when he’s back in office. And in case you didn’t know, Community First is you, you and you, and people that look like me. So Community First endorses Donald J. Trump to be the 47th President of these United States of America! Opportunity and dignity for all. That’s what we get with Donald Trump. The President of the United States. We know that’s what he going to be. So I don’t act like I’m not the only one that know that, right? I think the world need to hear us say we want a real Commander-in-Chief in office to represent all of our communities! I love you. And thank you.

Only one man is fighting for America’s prosperity. Only one man is fighting for America’s security.

Speaker 49 (01:39:00):

Only one man is fighting for you. Will you join the fight? Fight. Fight. With only nine days left, it is so important for you to vote. It is so important that you drag every like-minded family and friend. Grab your grandma, grab your brother, grab your sister, your neighbor, and drag them to the polls. You are part of the greatest comeback story in history, because one man has refused to back down. In the last four years, we have witnessed the destruction of this once great nation. We have seen countless criminals cross our borders. We have seen our economy crippled. Prices are out of control. Ask yourself, are you better off today than you were four years ago? Ask yourself, can you afford four more years of Kamala Harris America? We have a solution for you. We must send Donald Trump back to the White House.
(01:40:22)
President Trump has reshaped our party and to the party of the working class, a party which values prosperity and security, a party which doesn’t want new wars in faraway lands. Kamala Harris today is crisscrossing the country with Liz Cheney. Well, we have a message for you. You can keep Liz Cheney and for that matter, Dick Cheney too. I am so honored to be with all of you tonight as we work to push President Trump over the finish line. You and I are witnessing the greatest movement in American history, a movement that will be remembered for generations, a movement that will be remembered long after we are gone. Nothing will stop Donald Trump.
(01:41:24)
He’s been indicted more than Al Capone. They have tried to imprison him, bankrupt him, and even kill him. Well, it didn’t work, because he will never stop fighting for you. There is nothing that can stop the America first movement or the man who started it all, the 45th and soon 47th President, my friend, Donald J. Trump. And if we do our job, we will be watching the CNN meltdown on November 5th, as Wolf Blitzer announces Donald J. Trump has been elected the 47 President of the United States. Thank you, and onwards to victory.

David Rem (01:43:30):

Thank you. On November 20, 1974, my father suffered a massive heart attack and died. I went to this Kew-Forest School, the same school as our President Trump attended. Three days after my father’s burial, there was a knock on the door, one school morning, about 7:00 AM. I answered the door.
(01:43:55)
There was a very distinguished gentleman standing in front of me and he said, when I opened the door, “Kid, call your mom down, please.” I called upstairs to my mom. “Mom, there’s some guy here, please come down.” And she came down, and he said to her, “I’m very sorry to hear about Joseph Rem’s death. I’m Fred Trump, Donald’s father.” And my mom said, “Yes, I know Donald Trump went to Kew-Forest School.” He said, “Yes, Mrs. Rem, but what you probably don’t know is that I’m still on the board of trustees. And this morning, I let Philip Rogers, who’s the headmaster at Kew-Forest School, know that from this day forward, I, Fred Trump, out of my own pocket, is going to be paying for your three children’s tuition at Kew-Forest, because I don’t want the kids to have to go back into the public school system.”
(01:45:02)
Now, who would do that, except the President Trump’s father? And the fruit doesn’t fall far from the tree. Can you imagine Kamala Harris performing a random, kind, generous act like that? Never. Never, ever. In fact, she is the devil, whoever screamed that out. She is the Antichrist. At her rally last week, she said that, “Jesus Christ followers are not welcome at my rally. You should go down the block to President Trump’s rally.” Let me say this, and maybe I’m speaking for the President and I shouldn’t, but I think that President Trump loves Jesus followers at his rally. And I think that President Trump, in what he has experienced, knows that Jesus Christ is king.
(01:46:17)
I was the victim of a violent armed with a gun carjacking, and I’m lucky to be standing here. If it wasn’t for this man, Jesus Christ, I wouldn’t be standing here. The mayor that we have here in New York, Eric Adams, is a disaster. I once called out Bill de Blasio. This mayor is worse than Bill de Blasio and David Dinkins combined. I just want to say this, the cross that I’m holding is the cross that my mother, Beatrice Rem, used to hold in the air when she prayed at night every night for Donald Trump and his family.
(01:47:05)
Because we knew, three years ago, that his life was going to be attempted to killed, because they don’t want to face Donald Trump at the ballot box. So they’ll do anything they can, imprison him, kill him. And I’m just going to wrap this up, and I just want to tell President Trump that I’m fluent in Spanish and I will follow you to the swing states and I will speak in Spanish to the Latino voters. And I will make a difference. Donald, you need the Latino voters. The Latino voters will switch this election for your favor.
(01:47:44)
And I just want to drop an announcement here. I decided I’m going to make a run for Mayor of New York City. Please go to David Rem, D-A-V-I-D R-E-M, for Mayor. And I just want to say that we need to make New York red. We need to make New York great again. We need to make New York healthy again. We need to make the world great again. And I want to say I love you, President Trump. I love your entire family. They give you nothing but grief. And to the fake media out there who won’t show my story or won’t back Donald Trump, I love you, Donald. God bless America and God bless the United States of America. USA, USA, USA, USA.

Wow. Hello, New York City. How’s everybody doing this evening? Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. Look at me at Madison Square Garden, the world’s most famous arena. Who would’ve ever thought? I’ve been with this man for 30 years, 30 years through it all. I joined with him in 2015, when we started running for the presidency, when nobody said we had a shot, when we were a joke. We were polling at 1%, then he won the presidency. I went to the White House with him for four years. It was an incredible journey. The President always behind the scenes will tell him, Team Trump will know what I’m saying here, sometimes on the plane or in the office, he’ll say, “You are all so lucky I took you on this journey, in good times and bad.” “Yes, Mr. President, we are so honored to be on this journey.” And you know what? You’re damn straight I’m honored to be on this journey through the good times and the bad for the right and to fight for this country in which we all believe in.
(01:54:37)
Hey, Hillary Clinton. She had some not nice things to say about this rally today at Madison Square Garden. Take a look, Hillary. USA, USA, USA.

Dan Scavino (01:55:01):

This has been the journey of a lifetime. The last nine years. have absolutely been incredible. But guess what? We’ve got nine days. Nine days till we go to the polls and we vote for Donald J. Trump to be the 47th President of the United States of America. And it’s going to happen. But you all need to get out and vote, vote, vote, and fight, fight, fight. Just stay strong. The President loves each and everybody in this arena. Quick story, Butler, Pennsylvania, an attempted assassination. We went to the hospital. I’m going to give you a behind the scenes with the President. We go to the hospital, shot on the air. The entire world is watching on TV. He’s in his hospital room asking how things are going.
(01:55:55)
I showed him that iconic photo of him raising his fist and said, “Sir, this is the most iconic photo, I think, in the history of, not only politics, but of all time.” He stared at the photo. I told him it was from Doug Mills, New York Times photographer, a great photographer. The President’s reaction was, “How is Doug? Is Doug okay? Reach out to Doug, see how he’s doing.” Of which I did, when we were in the hospital. Everything he had going on, just shot in the damn head, and the guy’s cared and concerned about how Doug is doing, how his team is doing, that’s with him at Team Trump.
(01:56:40)
The behind the scenes moments are things… I could go, honestly, I could go for 10 hours here and tell you stories, but I only have 31 seconds left. So I will wrap it up. You’ve got a fighter, behind the scenes and out in public. The guy loves the United States of America. He’s working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, campaigning, running all over the country. Loves this country. He’s a patriot. You are all patriots. I cannot believe looking at this Madison Square garden and just seeing it’s packed to the brim, there must be 20,000 plus people. Love my family.
(01:57:23)
Just do me a favor, go to TrumpForce47.com, check it out. Okay? Get on there. Get out and vote, vote, vote please. We got to win. We’ve got to win. We are going to win. We are going to have Donald J. Trump as the 47th President of the United States America, if you all go out and vote, vote, vote, and fight-

Speaker 2 (01:58:41):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage senior advisor for President Donald J. Trump, Stephen Miller.

Stephen Miller (01:59:18):

Hello, New York. Hello, Madison Square Garden, and hello to the United States of America, people watching in all 50 states. We are here tonight with a message for you. In nine days, your rescue is coming. In nine days, your salvation is at hand. In nine days, Donald J. Trump is going to go back to the White House. We stand here today at a crossroads, in the history of this nation, in the history of our civilization. This is a choice between betrayal and renewal, between self-destruction and salvation, between the failure of America or the triumph of America. I want you to think for a minute about the decades of abuse that has been heaped upon the good people of this nation, their jobs looted and stolen from them and shipped to Mexico, Asia, and foreign countries, the lives of their loved ones ripped away from them by illegal aliens, criminal gangs, and thugs who don’t belong in this country, a political system that punishes hardworking citizens, oppresses them at every turn, takes away the right to free speech, the right to political expression, the right to fundamental safety in their own country.
(02:00:42)
One man dared to step forward nine years ago and say, “Enough, no more. America gets its future back.” And what happened next? What happened after he stepped down that escalator, nine years ago? The system, the system he was fighting, tried to do everything in its power to stop him, to take away your voice, to take away your vote, to take away your right to have your own country. They lied. They defamed. They smeared. One witch hunt after another, one hoax after another, one betrayal after another, lie after lie, slander after slander, libel after libel, lawsuit after lawsuit. They tried to jail him. They tried to bankrupt him. They tried to imprison him.
(02:01:36)
And they even tried to take his life with not one but two assassination attempts. And let me ask you, when his life was on the line, did he falter? Did he waver? Did he yield? Did he surrender? Did he hesitate? Did he back down? Did he give one single solitary inch? Or did he stand up strong and proud and resilient, the warrior that he is, and raise his fist into the air and shout, on behalf of all of you, “Fight, fight, fight.” And what was he fighting for? He was fighting for your children, for your wives, your husbands, everyone that you love and know in the world, the right to live in a country where criminal gangs cannot just cross our border and rape and murder with impunity. Think about how corrupt and hateful and evil a system is that allows gangs to come into this country and rape and murder little girls.
(02:02:32)
I’m not just saying that. You’ve read the stories. It happens every day. You read one of these heartbreaking headlines. Who’s going to stand up for our daughters? Who’s going to stand up for the girls of America, the woman of America, the families of America? Who’s going to stand up and say, “The cartels are gone. The criminal migrants are gone. The gangs are gone. America is for Americans and Americans only?” One man. And that man, ladies and gentlemen, that man took a bullet for you. He took a bullet for democracy. And all we are asking in return, all we are asking in return is for nine days, for nine short, precious days, you have to vote, vote, vote. Vote for freedom. Vote for liberty, vote for sovereignty. Vote for your children. Vote for your families. Vote for the right of free speech, the right to the Second Amendment.
(02:03:27)
Vote for the right to have a secure sovereign border and for the right to have a government that puts American citizens ahead of illegal aliens. With your votes, you can smash this broken establishment. With your votes, you can end the corruption and graft. And with your votes, with your votes, you can deliver the future to your children that they so dearly deserve. So I’ll end with this thought, each and every one of you has been loyal to your country. You have loved your country, you’ve followed the rules, you’ve paid your taxes, you did everything right, and the system just keeps beating you down, beating you down, and beating you down. And I say to you, are you going to let that system win? Are you going to surrender? Or are you going to follow the example of President Donald J. Trump and fight, fight, fight to the finish and save this nation, save this country, save this civilization, and save this glorious republic. Thank you, New York. God bless you. God bless New York and God bless America.

Steve Witkoff (02:05:33):

How good of a song is that? Reminds me of the President, his truth is marching on. Good evening, New York, and good evening to a special six-year-old. Hi, Finley. It’s a privilege, it’s a privilege to be here with all of you tonight, right in the heart of the city, that means so much to me. This city shaped who I am, helped me to build my business, and gave me my roots. But I’ll tell you, this is not the New York I grew up in. Our city has drifted away from what it once was. But if there’s one man who can restore it to its greatness, it is my dear friend, President Donald J. Trump.
(02:06:28)
I’ve known the President for over 30 years, not just as a leader, but as a friend. When I talk about him, I talk about someone with incredible compassion and humility. He cares deeply about people, even when the cameras are not rolling. His kindness is quiet, but genuine, and it’s a side of him the media rarely shows. It’s unfortunate that a man who has done so much for so many has been painted in such an unfair light. Accusations of extremism, they couldn’t be further from the truth. President Trump is not just a man of vision and leadership. He’s a man of faith. He respects all faiths and has always stood for religious freedom. His unabiding belief in the value of every individual is grounded in his respect for God and country. President Trump embraces freedom and fights for the rights of all Americans. Despite facing constant opposition, he has persevered. He’s been targeted with lawsuits and accusations, yet he’s never wavered in his commitment to the American people. I know he’ll fight for each and every one of you, as he’s always fought for me. That’s the kind of leader we need, someone who never backs down when things get tough, but keeps pushing forward for what’s right. In a world, thank you, in a world that often feels uncertain, President Trump offers each of us clarity. His policies are rooted in common sense. He understands the importance of strength, both at home and abroad, and leads with courage.
(02:08:33)
New York deserves someone who’s ready to fight for it as the country does. We need President Trump’s leadership to bring back the city we all love. Now, let me leave you with a quote from one of my favorite presidents, Ronald Reagan, who said, “Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn’t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for. It must be protected and handed on for them to do the same.” While Reagan was an extraordinary president, there is no doubt in my mind that President Donald J. Trump is the greatest leader and president this nation has ever seen. President Trump understands that the fight for freedom is never over. If we fight for him, my fellow Americans, we can restore New York, restore this country, secure the future of this great nation for generations to come. Thank you. God bless you, God bless the Trump family, and God bless the United States of America

Grant Cardone (02:12:00):

… me. I was born in Brooklyn, New York. In New York, we refer to MSG as the mecca. We refer to it as the center of entertainment, and in nine days, it’s going to be the launch point for the center of making Donald Trump the 47th President of the United States.

Audience (02:12:27):

USA. USA. USA.

Grant Cardone (02:12:36):

I don’t even want to talk about Kamala. Why? Why would we waste our time? She doesn’t even want to talk about herself. She tells us she grew up in a middle-class family, but I don’t care, because there’s families today in New York, in Chicago, in Philadelphia, in Milwaukee, in Phoenix. They are struggling because of Kamala Harris and they are saying the same thing we’re saying. “We had enough. We need Donald Trump back.”
(02:13:15)
She broke the border. She broke the border and doesn’t even have the guts to tell you the truth, but that’s okay, because the next President of the United States, he’s going to fix the border, because he did it once and he’s going to do it again. She unleashed the massive inflation that has made it harder for every working family in our country. If she was around when I was a kid, it would’ve devastated my mom, who still lives in Brooklyn. Hi, Mom. How you doing?
(02:13:56)
And you think she has an answer for the people who are trying to find ways to get ahead? No, she doesn’t. Nothing but word salad. I like salad. Everybody should have some. It’s healthy. It’s good for you. But this word-salad mess is demented. It is meant to make you think that she’s smart and you’re somehow dumb. The truth of the matter is the common sense of the American people is what is needed today, and that will be brought by Donald J. Trump. Then you look around the world. Look around the world. She says she was the last person in the room after that disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. That withdrawal is seared into my mind. I remember watching Afghanis hold on to the sides of airplanes to escape the Taliban. And as I’m watching this, the one thing I know is that if Donald Trump was president, that never would have happened. Never would have happened.
(02:15:19)
But I have a special message to everybody around the world, especially those who want to find themselves getting into the business of other people or messing with our greatest ally in Israel. Donald Trump is going to stand by Israel 100% of the way. 100% of the way. And Donald Trump is going to get us out of these wars, because he did it once and he’s going to do it again.
(02:15:51)
But the last thing we’re going to fix, and it’s a big one. You see, I got three kids. They’re all boys, and I’ll be damned if you’re going to have some school tell my boys that they can now be girls. Not on my watch. Not on the watch of Donald Trump. I can promise you that. We’re going to have common sense in America again under Donald Trump. We’re going to get men out of women’s sports under Donald Trump. America will take its place again as the Shining City on the Hill, as the leader of the world, as the number one nation, as the great experiment, because he’s going to fix it once again. And it’s together, New York and around America. We are going to make America great again. God bless you, New York. God bless America. Let’s go win. Let’s go win.

Speaker 50 (02:17:52):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Chair of the House Republican Conference, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

Alina Habba (02:18:30):

Hello, New York. I have a message for the mainstream media, and I can say this as a born and raised New Yorker. New York is Trump country.
(02:18:51)
Wow. It is incredible to be here in the iconic Madison Square Garden. President Trump has been talking about this rally for years, and what a way to kick off the final week of the most epic campaign to save America. Every election we say is the most important in our lifetime, but this one really is. No matter where you go, whether it’s in New York City, upstate New York, or in any of the swing states, people understand there is so much at stake. And it is we, the people. When we vote for President Donald J. Trump, we, the people, will save America.
(02:19:48)
Just look at the crises that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have brought to our nation and have brought right here to New York. The border crisis: illegals swarming our streets, taking billions of our hard-earned taxpayer dollars, all because Kamala Harris is Joe Biden’s open-border czar. She owns this border crisis. She created it. Or the inflation crisis: the highest rate of inflation in our lifetime. And you know who was the deciding vote for Joe Biden’s? Inflation Expansion Act? Kamala Harris. And the crime crisis. Democrats are the party of defund the police, and Kamala Harris has turned her back on our men and women in blue. New Yorkers support our police. We will always back the blue.
(02:20:53)
And then take a look around the world. What is happening? You had the catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan. Kamala Harris was the last person in the room advising Joe Biden of that horrific mistake. You had Putin invading Ukraine, and then just over one year ago, we had our most precious ally, Israel, under attack from Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists, and Kamala Harris has turned her back on Israel. And what did we see? What did we see on our college campuses? We saw a skyrocketing of anti-Semitism. Let me ask you all, did you see that committee hearing with those college presidents, now former college presidents? That’s right. I asked the presidents of Penn, MIT and Harvard, “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your university’s code of conduct?” And one after the other said, “It depends on the context,” and the world heard. You are fired. Five have been fired, so many to go.
(02:22:10)
And compare that with President Trump. He brought us the most secure border in our nation’s history. He brought us the strongest economy. He proudly supports our law enforcement, and he has and always will stand with Israel. Donald J. Trump has fought for us, the American people, whether it was fighting against the sham impeachment, which I was a proud member of President Trump’s impeachment defense team, whether it was standing up for election integrity, or whether it was facing the witch-hunts by New York’s own Tish James, Alvin Bragg and corrupt judges.
(02:23:08)
After we fire Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, we’re going to fire Kathy Hochul, Alvin Bragg, Tish James. You’re fired. As I said, President Trump has fought for us. It is now our opportunity to fight for him. And New York, we made history when we fired Nancy Pelosi once and for all and flipped those five congressional seats. We need to make history again. So nine days. Flood the polls. Vote for President Donald J. Trump to save New York and save America. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much.

Speaker 50 (02:24:41):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Mike Johnson.

Mike Johnson (02:25:25):

Hello, Madison Square Garden. Is New York ready to make America great again? My friends, I came here tonight so excited to be with you. I came off of the field to give you a very important field report. Now, I’ve been traveling all around the country nonstop. We’ve been to the red states and the blue states. We’ve been to the safe districts and the swing districts. We’ve been all around America, and I’m going to tell you what’s happening right now. I’m here to report something. There’s something very powerful happening out there among the base, okay? I’m telling you, there’s an energy out there that we have not seen before, and I am convinced that in nine days, we are going to grow the House majority. We’re going to take back the Senate and send Donald Trump back to the White House.
(02:26:24)
Let me tell you why that is. Let me tell you why that is: because everywhere around the country, no matter where you live, everybody is fed up and they are fired up. They’re fed up. It doesn’t matter what demographic they’re in. It doesn’t matter what walk of life. They know that we cannot afford four more years of Kamala Harris in the White House, and we can’t possibly afford turning the House or the Senate over to the Democrats.
(02:26:46)
Let me ask you a question. Let me ask you what I asked these groups all around the country. Do you want four more years of open borders? I don’t think you do.

Audience (02:26:54):

No.

Mike Johnson (02:26:54):

No. No. Do you want four more years of high cost and inflation?

Audience (02:27:01):

No.

Mike Johnson (02:27:01):

Do you want four more years of rising crime in every community? No.

Audience (02:27:04):

No.

Mike Johnson (02:27:06):

Or how about four more years of woke ideology in our schools, in our military?

Audience (02:27:12):

No.

Mike Johnson (02:27:12):

Do you want four more years of wars and weakness on the world stage?

Audience (02:27:18):

No.

Mike Johnson (02:27:18):

Nobody does. American voters are sick of it and they want a change. Now, listen. For the last two years we’ve had a bit of a dilemma, right? The House has been the only firewall in Washington standing between Chuck Schumer and the Democrats in the Senate, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, and the American people. Now we played defense. We block their woke America-last agenda and we passed solutions to all the great challenges facing the country. But here’s the problem. They got stopped in the Senate. We also had the smallest Republican majority in US history.
(02:27:50)
But you know what the good news is? We’re about to grow that majority. That’s what’s going to happen on November 5th. New York is going to make that happen. You’re going to elect your incumbents here and our challengers and you’re going to make the big difference. And we need a Republican Senate so we can retire Chuck Schumer for good. And America needs, and everybody knows, no matter where we are in the country, we know we have to get Donald J. Trump back to the White House so we can get this thing fixed.
(02:28:27)
When we do that, we’re going to secure the border once and for all. We’re going to unleash American energy dominance again. We’re going to lower the cost of living. We’re going to support our allies and stand up to our adversaries. We’re going to defend our rights and our freedoms and the troops and the veterans who fought for them, and we will protect the values and the principles that made America the greatest nation in the history of the world. I’ll just leave you with this thought. We’re not in a battle this time just between two different political parties. It’s much deeper than that. There’s something much more fundamental going on. We’re in a battle between two completely different visions for who we are as a nation and who we’re going to be. We revere the founding principles. We revere our Judeo-Christian foundations. We revere individual freedom and limited government and the rule of law and peace through strength and fiscal responsibility, free markets, human dignity, secure borders.
(02:29:27)
But the other team doesn’t any more, my friends. This is not your father’s Democratic Party. They are now full-on to Marxism and socialism. They don’t envision for us to save the founding principles in the greatest nation in the history of the world. Instead, what they envision for us is that we would be some sort of European-style, Marxist, borderless utopia. We all know that’s a dangerous fool’s errand.
(02:29:56)
You know what’s going to happen in nine days? The American people are going to let their voices be heard. We are going to take this country back. We’re going to restore the foundations and we are truly going to make America great again. Thank you so much. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.

This is how legends are made.

Vivek Ramaswamy (02:31:35):

I’ll tell you something. I don’t follow the polls, I don’t follow the pundits, but I follow the energy, and this does not feel like second-place energy in here tonight. I had a friend of mine, smart guy, he’s a billionaire, texted me this morning, and he said, “Why the hell are you guys wasting your time in New York City instead of going to a swing state?” You want to know what I told him? I said, “Welcome to 2024. New York is a swing state.”
(02:32:21)
I got a message for Kamala Harris tonight. We’re feeling the joy in New York City tonight, aren’t we? And the only celebration bigger than this one right now is going to be on the evening of November 5th, when we send Donald J. Trump back to the White House as your 47th president and commander-in-chief. And I’m looking around here. There’s only one man who is going to be more happy than everybody else in this room when that happens, and that is going to be a man by the name of Joe Biden, actually. He is so pissed off about what they did then. And he’s thinking it, but I’m going to say it. Identity politics never works in America. When you select somebody on the basis of their race and their gender, it always ends up being a disaster. And I’m actually talking about Tim Walsh this time, by the way. It goes both ways.
(02:33:29)
So listen up, guys. Last year I became the youngest person ever to run for US president as a Republican. Thank you. I appreciate that. And I’ll tell you something about my generation. We are lost. We are hungry to be part of something bigger than ourselves, yet we can’t even answer what it means to be an American today. We’re in the middle of a national identity crisis. Faith in God, patriotism, hard work, family. These things have disappeared, only to be replaced by woke-ism and transgenderism, climatism, COVID-ism, depression, anxiety, fentanyl, suicide. These are symptoms of a deeper void of purpose and meaning in our country, and right now, we need to step up and fill that void with our own vision.
(02:34:20)
Answer, what does it mean to be an American in the year 2024? It means we believe in the ideals of 1776. It means we believe in merit: that the best person gets the job regardless of their skin color, that you get ahead in this country not on the color of your skin, but on the content of your character and your contributions. That’s why we’re done with the woke DEI agenda. Bringing in meritocracy to America. It means we believe in the rule of law, and I say this as the kid of legal immigrants to this country. That means your first act of entering this country cannot break the law, and that is why if we’ve had the largest influx of illegals into this country in American history, we will have the largest mass deportation in American history. That is now racist or xenophobic. That is what it means to stand for the rule of law in the United States of America.
(02:35:21)
It means we believe in self-governance: that the people we elect to run the government, for God’s sake, ought to be the ones who actually run the government, not unelected bureaucrats in the deep state that are running the show today. So you want another mass deportation? Let’s get 3 million federal bureaucrats out of the DC bureaucracy. That’s the mass deportation that saves the country.
(02:35:47)
What does it mean to be American? It means we have elections we can trust and believe in, and that means single-day voting on election day as a national holiday with paper ballots and government-issued ID to match the voter file. That’s how we save the country after we win at this time by voting early. These are not black ideas or white ideas. They are American ideals that set this country into motion. We’re in a war to revive them, and right now we need the commander-in-chief who will lead us to victory. That is your next president, Donald J. Trump.
(02:36:28)
If you want to seal the border, vote Trump. If you want to restore law and order in this country, vote Trump. If you want to grow the economy in this country, vote Trump. If you want to revive national pride in this country, vote Trump. If you want to stay out of World War III in this country, vote Trump. If you want to make America great again, vote Trump. I’m going to give you one more reason to vote Trump, and it’s this. It’s the one the media in the back, they won’t talk about this, but they know it to be true. Donald Trump is actually the president who will unite this country, actually, and we don’t talk about that enough.
(02:37:14)
America First includes all Americans, regardless of their race, their gender, or their sexual orientation. Our message to Black Americans tonight is this: we want you what we want for every American. Safe neighborhoods, good jobs, clean streets, a country where you are judged based on the content of your character, not the color of your skin or your political beliefs. That’s the America we know. Our message to gay Americans tonight is this: you’re free to marry who you want, if you want, without the government standing in your way. But that doesn’t mean that boys get to compete with girls in girls’ sports or you do genital mutilation and chemical castration on our children.
(02:38:08)
Our message to every legal immigrant in this country is this: you’re like my parents. If you came legally, you get the same American dream that everybody else does. Work hard, get ahead, make contributions to this country, love the nation, and that’s our message to legal immigrants. But our message to every illegal immigrant is also this: we will return you to your country of origin, not because you’re all bad people, but because you broke the law, and the United States of America is on the rule of law.
(02:38:47)
Our message to my generation, the Millennials, is this. You were sold a false bill of goods. You were told you’d become a gender-studies major in California. Somehow that gets you a headstart on the American dream, when it hasn’t worked out that way. Dead on your shoulders. The Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Yes, it’s true you were lied to. But we can’t just be cynical about our country, because this is still the last best hope that we have in the free world.
(02:39:11)
And our message to Gen Z is this. You’re going to be the generation that saves the country. You want to be a rebel, 18 years old, stand up on your college campus and call yourself a conservative. Be proud of it. Say you want to get married, have kids, raise a family and have a good job. That’s how we win in America. We don’t have to be this nation in decline. We are still on our way up. We’re still that country where we will look our children in the eye and mean it when we tell them, “You get ahead in the United States with your own hard work, your own commitment, your own dedication, and that, you know what? You are free to speak your mind at every step of the way.”
(02:39:51)
That is the American Dream. That is what we are running to and that is what we get when we send Donald Trump back to the White House this November. Thank you, God bless you in the great state of New York, and may God bless our United States of America. Thank you. God bless. Thank you, guys.

Faced with an army of vipers and lions.

I had to keep on reaching up, because it was my time.
(02:40:50)
To tear down the kingdom, call out the liars.
(02:41:06)
Got a jail on my heart-

Tulsi Gabbard (02:41:24):

Hello, New York. Join me as I say these words.

Audience (02:41:32):

[inaudible 02:41:35].

Tulsi Gabbard (02:41:34):

We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal and that we are endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, and that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
(02:41:54)
As we gather here today on this historic occasion, we stand together as proud Americans and understanding that these very rights are under attack. So we face this historic crossroads where our freedom and our future is in our hands. There’s never been a more clear choice in any election in my life, and our ability to live in a truly peaceful and free and prosperous country is on the line.

Audience (02:42:32):

Love you, Tulsi.

Tulsi Gabbard (02:42:33):

I love you too. And it is that love, that love that brings us together here today, that love for freedom, that love for our country and love for each other as fellow Americans, as children of God, that compels us to take action to save our country and defend our freedom. Now, this choice that we have before us is very personal to me. I’m a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve. I’ve served now for over 21 years. I’ve deployed to different war zones three times over that period, and I’ve seen the cost of war. For my brothers and sisters who paid the ultimate price, I carry their memories and their sacrifice in my heart every day. So this choice that we have before us as Americans is critical. It’s important to us. It’s important to those of us who served, who have volunteered to put our lives on the line for the safety, security, and freedom of our country and our people, and it’s critical to all of us.
(02:43:57)
Here is the choice that we have. A vote for Kamala Harris is a vote for Dick Cheney and it’s a vote for more war, likely World War III and nuclear war. A vote for Donald Trump is a vote for a man who wants to end wars, not start them, and who has demonstrated already that he has the courage and strength to stand up and fight for peace.
(02:44:32)
A vote for Kamala Harris is a vote for open borders, where known violent criminals and Islamist terrorists are streaming across our borders, placing us at risk. A vote for Donald Trump is a vote for secure borders and safe communities and a confidence that he will seek out those who seek to do us harm and get them out.

Tulsi Gabbard (02:45:00):

A vote for Kamala Harris is a vote for economic hardship, high cost of living, poverty and homelessness and a vote for Donald Trump is a vote for economic prosperity and opportunity for every single one of us as Americans. A vote for Kamala Harris is a vote for censorship and a complete erosion of our fundamental and constitutional rights and freedoms, a vote for Donald Trump is a vote for someone who will defend freedom and every one of our God-given rights that are enshrined in the Constitution and Bill of Rights. So, the choice is ours. History will look back on us at this moment for the choice that we make. Did we choose war or peace? Did we choose poverty or prosperity? Did we choose censorship or freedom?

Audience (02:46:01):

Freedom.

Tulsi Gabbard (02:46:06):

Our freedom and our future is in our hands. We have just a few days left to complete this no-fail mission that we have before us to save our country. Nothing short of our future is on the line. So, now, just as we’ve gathered here today in this historic place and this historic time, we will gather together all across this country, people of every race, ethnicity, religion and creed, to stand together and defend our freedom and ensure our right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Now is the time for us to send Donald Trump back to the White House to be the 47th president of the United States where we can stand together and make America great again. Thank you so much. Let’s get it done. Aloha.

This is not the party anymore of Martin Luther King, of Robert Kennedy, of John Kennedy, that was the party of peace, it was the party of constitutional rights, of civil rights, of freedom of speech, it was the party that wanted to protect and nurture the middle class, it was the party that stood up to censorship, to surveillance and stood up to the CIA, the military industrial complex and it was the party that wanted to protect public health and women’s sports. My uncle Ted Kennedy wrote Title IX which protected women’s sports in college. It was the party that believed in voting rights and fought for the right of every American to vote for the person of their choice.
(02:50:40)
Today’s Democratic Party is the party of war, is the party of the CIA. You had Kamala Harris giving a speech at the Democratic Convention that was written by neocons, it was belligerent, Ignatius, had talked about the domination of the world by the United States through our weapons of war, is the party today that wants to divide Americans, it’s the party that is dismantling women’s sports by letting men play women’s sports.

Audience (02:51:15):

Boo.

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (02:51:21):

It’s the party of Wall Street, it’s the party of Bill Gates who just gave $50 million to Kamala Harris.

Audience (02:51:31):

Boo.

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (02:51:33):

It’s the party-

Speaker 53 (02:51:33):

[inaudible 02:51:34]

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (02:51:38):

And the Harris campaign is very proud that it received the endorsement of 50 former CIA agents and officers.

Audience (02:51:45):

Boo.

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (02:51:48):

And of John Bolton and of Dick Cheney. These are the people that gave us a war in Iraq, the worst foreign policy catastrophe that’s ever happened to this country. These are the people that gave us the Patriot Act that launched the surveillance state. These are the people that are trying to undermine voting rights in this country by weaponizing the federal agencies against political candidates, including me and Donald Trump and all other political candidates, they can’t win an election. And instead of bringing in a candidate who wins the primaries, abolish the primaries and then pick two candidates, anoint them without receiving votes. We don’t even know how Kamala Harris received the nomination.

Speaker 54 (02:52:50):

[inaudible 02:52:53]

Speaker 55 (02:52:50):

[inaudible 02:52:55]

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (02:52:57):

And this is the party of Wall Street, of big banks, of big data, of big tech, of the military contractors and the parties of big pharma, big ag, big food and big chemicals. It is the party that’s given us the sickest children in the history of the world.

Speaker 56 (02:53:22):

[inaudible 02:53:24]

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (02:53:25):

When my uncle was president, 6% of Americans had chronic disease and we spend zero on chronic disease in this country. Today, 60% of Americans have chronic disease, this is existential for our country. We’re spending $4.3 trillion a year, five times our military budget. 77% of American boys cannot qualify for military service because of chronic disease diagnoses, this is existential for our country. President Trump called me three hours after his shooting and he said would I come and sit down with him and he said to me during that meeting, he said, “There are some things that we can agree on and some we disagree on but the landscapes on which we agree are so much larger.” He said, “I want to end the wars.”

Audience (02:54:30):

Whoo.

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (02:54:30):

“I want to end the surveillance and censorship.”

Audience (02:54:33):

Whoo.

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (02:54:35):

Whoo.

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (02:54:45):

“I want to end the surveillance, I want to end the weaponization of government against American politicians and I want to end the chronic disease epidemic.”

Audience (02:55:03):

Whoo.

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (02:55:03):

Now, don’t you think that we deserve a president in this country who’s going to restore the moral authority of the United States of America?

Speaker 57 (02:55:13):

Yeah.

Speaker 58 (02:55:15):

Yeah.

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (02:55:16):

Don’t you think that we deserve a president who’s going to end the warfare state and rebuild the middle class?

Audience (02:55:25):

Whoo.

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (02:55:27):

Don’t you want a president who’s going to put America first?

Speaker 59 (02:55:35):

Yeah.

Audience (02:55:36):

Whoo.

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (02:55:36):

And don’t you want a president who’s going to protect our children?

Audience (02:55:43):

Yeah.

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (02:55:43):

And who’s going to protect women’s sports?

Audience (02:55:48):

Yeah.

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (02:55:48):

And who’s going to stop dividing this country around long racial lines?

Speaker 60 (02:55:54):

Yeah.

Speaker 61 (02:55:54):

Whoo.

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (02:55:55):

And don’t you want a president who’s going to end the corruption at the federal agencies?

Audience (02:56:05):

Yeah.

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (02:56:05):

At FDA, at NIH, at CDC and at the CIA?

Audience (02:56:09):

Yeah.

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (02:56:14):

And don’t you want a president who’s going to make America healthy again?

Audience (02:56:26):

Yeah.

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (02:56:26):

And don’t you want a president who’s going to make America great again?

Audience (02:56:33):

Yeah.

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (02:56:34):

Then we need to go to the polls on November 5th and vote for Donald Trump. God bless you and God bless America.

Speaker 51 (02:56:40):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, Tucker Carlson.

Audience (02:56:40):

Whoo.

Tucker Carlson (02:56:40):

Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha. Thank you.

Audience (02:56:40):

Whoo.

Tucker Carlson (02:58:03):

Ah. I saw the Grateful Dead in this arena in 1987, I was seated right there. How weird. It’s such an honor to be here and it’s wild. Just another day following Bobby Kennedy, Jr. at a Donald Trump rally in Madison Square Garden. What? That’s totally normal. Liz Cheney’s out there with Kamala Harris and there’s Bobby Kennedy calling to protect the women’s sports at a Trump rally. It’s a realignment, it’s unbelievable and the fact that it’s here is even sweeter. Imagine if you’re … And just pause for one moment. Imagine you’re Donald Trump, you’re from New York City, you become famous in New York City, you make your fortune in New York City and, all of a sudden, the leadership of New York City decides they’re going to destroy you because they don’t like your politics and so, they-

Audience (02:59:02):

Boo.

Tucker Carlson (02:59:03):

Yeah, boo. Imagine if that were you though and they try and take everything that you have, they try and put you in prison, they try and put your children in prison. If that happened to you, how often do you think you’d be going back to New York City?

Audience (02:59:17):

Never.

Tucker Carlson (02:59:18):

How about never? And yet he’s here, it’s like getting thrown out of a bar. And you think to yourself, “Well, all my friends are in the bar.” And you approach the door and there’s the bouncer like, “You’re not allowed in here.” But from behind the bouncer, you hear the cheers of your friend, “Come on in,” and the bouncer hangs his head in shame. He’s embarrassed that he’s working for the man trying to keep the most popular person out of the bar. And that’s Donald Trump back in the city that produced him with no embarrassment at all in a room full of his friends. The stones that takes, the bravery that takes is incredible. Donald Trump’s going to win.

Audience (03:00:03):

Yeah.

Tucker Carlson (03:00:04):

He’s going to win. I know that that’s true. Why is Donald Trump going to win? The people he’s about to defeat have no idea. And they’re panicked, they have no idea why people like Donald Trump. And their first theory was, well, Donald Trump is evil so half the country’s evil also. And that’s one of the reasons they spent the last four years trying to destroy the country because they’re mad at its voters for liking Donald Trump. How much easier would it have been just to pause for 20 minutes and ask yourself honestly in some silent place why do people like Donald Trump. And if they had been honest enough to ask themselves that question, they would’ve come up with the two main reasons and here’s what they are.
(03:00:49)
The first reason that people like Donald Trump is because he likes them, that’s why. And it’s real, affection is something you can’t fake. I don’t care how many times Kamala Harris would tell me she loves me, I don’t believe her.

Speaker 62 (03:01:02):

Boo.

Tucker Carlson (03:01:04):

I saw her kiss her husband with a mask on, a mask on. That’s her version of love. It’s fake, it’s not real. They spent 10 years telling you Trump is a hater, do you feel that on him? No, you don’t.

Audience (03:01:22):

No.

Tucker Carlson (03:01:22):

Because it’s not there. I’ve spent a lot of time with Trump and there’s not one moment I’ve ever been with him off camera where he’s spending his time grousing about people he hates, ever. He’s talking about the people and the country he loves in his private time, trust me. And people know, in a country that has been taken over by a leadership class that actually despises them and their values and their history and their culture and their customs really hates them to the point that it’s trying to replace them, they know someone who actually has affection for them and that’s Donald Trump.

Speaker 63 (03:01:56):

Yeah.

Audience (03:01:56):

Yeah.

Tucker Carlson (03:01:57):

And it’s requited. It’s requited, they know. When he goes to McDonald’s and serves fries, he’s not faking that at all, that’s why that worked. Democratic media consultant is like, “How is that working?” Because it’s real, that’s why. And the second reason that people love Trump and I put myself in this category, it’s why I’m here today is because he’s liberated us in the deepest and truest sense. And the liberation he has brought to us is the liberation from the obligation to tell lies. Donald Trump has made it possible for the rest of us to tell the truth about the world around us and that’s the single most liberating thing you can do for people. If you want to enslave people, if you want to degrade them, force them to tell lies and they have. They forced us to lie about everything at gunpoint effectively. They put people in prison for refusing to lie.
(03:02:55)
And not just the obvious lies that men can become women or Vladimir Putin blew up the Nord Stream pipeline, no, honestly, he did. January 6th was insurrection, they were unarmed but it was very insurrectiony. Not even the obvious ones but the big lie. You know what the big lie is? The big lie is that they’re impressive, that’s what the big lie is. That the people in charge have somehow earned the right to rule over you and they haven’t and you know that. These are the single most useless people in the United States, they have no skills whatsoever.

Audience (03:03:29):

Yeah.

Tucker Carlson (03:03:29):

They’ve got three quarters of the money and they didn’t earn it. They set up a system precisely for the purpose of awarding themselves wealth and power when it’s undeserved. You look at Liz Cheney and you ask yourself honestly, what skill could she possibly have that allowed her to send hundreds of thousands of people to their deaths? Did she earn that? I don’t think she did. No fair system would make Liz Cheney powerful. No fair system would make Larry Fink rich. No fair system would elevate someone like Kamala Harris to a presidential nomination. She’s never been accused of doing anything useful, she has precisely no achievement, she’s a nominee without getting a single vote. She’s a metaphor for the system they created to make themselves rich and powerful and then they have the gall to lecture you that people can actually change a flat tire and repair a power grid, who have useful jobs, who pay your taxes and work 40 hours a week, lecture you that you are somehow immoral.
(03:04:37)
And Donald Trump has empowered the rest of us through mostly just sticking around in the face of their hate and abuse and persecution, he has given the rest of us the right to call BS on the charade. No, you are not better than us. No, you are not smarter than us. No, you do not deserve what you have, you probably stole it. No, you’re not going to bully me into silence anymore. And I can promise you, at this point, nine days out when Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Elon Musk and Tulsi Gabbard and pretty much every high school senior and college shorty girl in the country has come out and finally say, “Yeah, I am for Donald Trump, actually.”

Audience (03:05:18):

Yeah.

Tucker Carlson (03:05:18):

When the entire country has realized there is nothing embarrassing about this, what’s embarrassing is to take a perfectly great country and destroy it as they have. I’m not ashamed, you should be. At that moment, it’s going to be pretty tough for them 10 days from now to look in the eye to America with a straight face, it’s going to be pretty hard to look at us and say, “You know what? Kamala Harris, she got 85 million votes because she’s just so impressive.” As the first Samoan, Malaysian, blow IQ, former California prosecutor ever to be elected president, it was just a groundswell of popular support and anyone who thinks otherwise is just a freak or a criminal. At this stage of the game after nine years of listening to their lies and finding every single one of them totally false, no, it’s not safe and effective and, no, she’s not impressive. It’s very hard for me to believe the rest of us are going to say, “You know what, Joe Scarborough, you’re right, you’re right. She won fair and square because she’s just so impressive.”
(03:06:28)
I don’t think so. And to me, that is liberation. It’s the freedom to say what’s obviously true as a free man and not a slave. And I just want to say thank you, Donald Trump, for that.

Audience (03:06:43):

Whoo.

Speaker 51 (03:06:43):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, professional wrestler, Hulk Hogan.

Audience (03:06:43):

Whoo. USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.

Hulk Hogan (03:10:07):

Well, let me tell you something, Trumpamaniacs, welcome to the house that Hulkamania built. You know something? Usually, when I’m in Madison Square Garden, I’m body slamming giants, I’m winning world heavyweight titles and I’m cracking people over the heads with steel chairs and the energy in Madison Square Garden is off the Richter scale. But today, Trumpamaniacs, the energy in here is something like I’ve never felt. The energy of all these Trumamaniacs is the most powerful force in the universe and, today, this is Donald Trump’s house, brother. You know something, Trumpamaniacs? I don’t see no stinking Nazis in here, I don’t see no stinking domestic terrorists in here, the only thing I see in here are a bunch of hardworking men and women that are real Americans, brother.

Audience (03:11:10):

Yeah.

Hulk Hogan (03:11:19):

When I hear my president and our president Donald Trump speak, he sounds for real, brother, he sounds like he has a heart of gold, this all for the USA. But when I hear Kamala speak-

Audience (03:11:36):

Boo.

Hulk Hogan (03:11:36):

… it sounds, yeah, it sounds like a script from Hollywood with a really, really bad actress. Kamala is responsible for the border crisis and Kamala is also responsible for inflation. And then you know something? She acts like she’s the victim. And then, all of a sudden, she flips, she flops, she spins and turns it around and acts like she’s going to be the hero.

Audience (03:12:20):

Boo.

Hulk Hogan (03:12:24):

But we all know Trump is the man that can fix this country today.

Audience (03:12:30):

Yeah.

Hulk Hogan (03:12:34):

And with Trump as our commander in chief, peace through strength will fix all the problems in the Middle East. I’ve been coming to this building month after month after month and I’ve seen sold out crowds over and over again for over 40 years. And for 40 years, I’ve always asked the question, “What you going to do?” Over and over and over again, “What you going to do?” Well, today, after feeling the energy in this building, I finally got the answer and the answer is vote for Trump.

Audience (03:13:22):

Yeah.

Hulk Hogan (03:13:28):

So, now, I got a couple questions for you. What you going to do about the border invasion?

Audience (03:13:40):

Vote for Trump.

Hulk Hogan (03:13:40):

What you going to do about inflation?

Audience (03:13:45):

Vote for Trump.

Hulk Hogan (03:13:45):

What you going to do about keeping America safe, brother?

Audience (03:13:51):

Vote for Trump.

Hulk Hogan (03:13:51):

And what you going to do about putting God in our homes, in our country and our schools?

Audience (03:14:02):

Vote for Trump.

Hulk Hogan (03:14:03):

So, I guess we’re all on the same page so I got one final question for you. What you going to do and who’s going to make America great again?

Audience (03:14:17):

Donald Trump.

Hulk Hogan (03:14:18):

God bless Donald Trump, he’s our next president.

Audience (03:17:29):

Whoo. USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.

Hulk Hogan (03:17:30):

Thank you, guys.

Dr. Phil.

Audience (03:17:51):

Whoo.

Dr. Phil McGraw (03:17:51):

Thank you.

Dr. Phil (03:18:36):

You guys look just like you do when I’m on TV. Except for you, you look a little different. Listen, I love you guys for caring enough about the United States of America to come out here tonight. Thank you so much for caring enough to come out here tonight. I have to tell you, I love this country. I do. I love this country. I stand up when our flag goes by. I put my hand over my heart when they play our national anthem, and I’m so proud to see so many people take time out of their day to come out here and stand up for this country. And strangely enough, I’m not here just to stand up for Donald J. Trump. Lord knows he doesn’t need me to stand up for him. He’s tough as an old Army boot. He’s got lots of enemies, different groups that are scared, and between them, they have impeached him, indicted him, raided him, railroaded him, shot him and sued him. And where is he? He is still standing. He just keeps on coming because he loves this country too. I can be honest because we have free speech in America.
(03:20:29)
I can be honest and say I don’t like or agree everything that Donald J. Trump does or says. Come on. Nobody agrees with everything or likes everything somebody else says or does, right? No human is perfect. We don’t strive for perfection. We strive for excellence, but you don’t have to love everything about someone in order to love them. And the last thing he needs is some celebrity endorsement. What the hell do I know? I know I’m no celebrity to begin with. And celebrities don’t know anything about policies or politics. Only difference between me and them is I’m willing to admit it.
(03:21:28)
Why am I here? I’ll tell you why I’m here. I’m here to talk to and stand up for the people who have declared their support for Donald J. Trump, or they got found out, or they want to do it, but they’re too intimidated. Because you know what happens when somebody in this country says, “Hey, I’m going to vote Republican. I’m going to vote Donald J. Trump.” They get canceled, intimidated, marginalized, excluded, or even fired or boycotted. And you know what that means? In short, that adds up to being bullied.
(03:22:15)
And now we’re talking about something I know a hell of a lot about. Now you’re in my wheelhouse, buddy. I may not be an expert in politics, but I am an expert about bullying, and bullying is when you seek to harm somebody, you seek to intimidate, coerce, cause distress, fear, risk to their well-being, and it can be physical, verbal, relational or cyber bullying. And it’s always wrong. You said it my friend. It is always wrong when you bully somebody. And that’s what’s going on.
(03:22:59)
Now, let me tell you what the critics are going to say when they hear me talking about this. They’re going to say, “Now, wait a minute. Come on. Isn’t Trump a bully?” And let me tell you why the answer to that question is no. Because to be a bully, there has to be an imbalance of power. And when there’s not, it’s just called a debate and he’s just better at it than anybody else. It is called debating. It’s called arguing. It may even name-calling, but it’s not bullying unless there’s an imbalance of power. And whoever he talks to, they’ve got a microphone, they got on their big boy pants, they got a stage, they got everything else. He’s just better at it.
(03:23:50)
And the same thing is true. When the Democrats or Harris call him fascist, Hitler, racist, misogynist or a crook, is that bullying? Not really. It’s ugly. But with the first amendment, which we all want to keep, there’s no imbalance of power, so it’s not bullying. It’s just like when he does it. It may not be the best use of energy. But when you attack civilians, when you attack a citizen and you use the power of the internet, you use mob mentality, you incite people to gang up and cause boycotts, then it’s beyond ugly. And that’s what’s happening in this country right now. And that’s not okay.
(03:24:41)
There is an imbalance of power there and it’s time that every one of us close ranks. We have to stop this now. It’s time that we push back against cancel culture. It’s time that we push back against intimidation tactics. And that is exactly the reason that I launched Merit Street Media, which, by the way, we didn’t choose the name for that by random. Merit Street Media. This country was built on hard work, added value and talent, not on equal outcome, not on DEI. This country was built on hard work and it needs to continue to be built on hard work.
(03:25:33)
And the legacy media has sold out. The legacy media has sold out. And I’ll tell you, one night, I was sitting at dinner with my wife, Robin, and I was complaining as we were flipping around and listening to the spin, spin, spin on what’s supposedly news. And I said, “Damn, I’m tired of listening to all this media spin and everything.” And without even looking up, she said, “You are the media. Why don’t you do something about it?” She said, “You got bigger ratings than the four of them combined. Why don’t you do something about it?”
(03:26:15)
As usual, she was right. And that’s why I launched the new network because we want people to think for themselves. You guys aren’t dumb. You don’t need to be told what to think. You just need the facts. And you’re here because you have the facts, right? You’re here because you recognize when legacy media edits answers and gives you what they want you to hear instead of the truth. And when they start editing their candidate’s answers, they’ve lost their moral compass, they’ve lost their way. And I would love to say it’s equal on both sides, but I’ll guarantee you, when Beyonce, George Clooney, De Niro and Lizzo come out and say they’re for Kamala Harris… When they all come out and say they’re for Kamala Harris, did you read anything or hear anything in the media criticizing it? No. But you watch what happens tomorrow morning when people find out I came here to talk to you. You say this in Hollywood and all of a sudden you ain’t got a job. The problem is I don’t need one. I don’t need a job. I got you and I’ve got a question for all of us. Have we lost our minds? We have the first amendment in America, where our government has said we will pass no laws to infringe on our freedoms for religion and speech. That’s the law, but we’re muzzling each other. What is going on? We have a law that protects free speech, so we start taking it away from each other. Are you kidding me? We can’t allow that to happen. We cannot encourage it. And let me tell you something about bullying. Bullies are bad, right? Let me tell you what else is bad bystanders. If you are a bystander, if you are watching somebody get picked on, if you’re watching somebody get bullied and you don’t do anything about it, you’re just as guilty as the bully that’s doing the bullying. Am I right? Am I right? I have talked to so many children in schools that tell me the worst feeling they’ve ever had is being bullied and feeling alone and abandoned when they are picked on and intimidated, when they wished even one person, even one other kid would step up and say, “Hey, come sit with me at lunch. Don’t sit in a stall in the bathroom and cry your way through lunch and eat alone. We are not going to let you be alone.” And it’s the same thing with adults. Adults don’t want to be cut out of the herd and feel like they’re alone. The number one need in all people is acceptance. The number one fear is rejections and bullies. They prey on that. We must claim the right to our point of view. We must be critical thinkers. And when you see somebody being picked on, then you’ve got to be willing to step up and say, “Hey, I’m with you. Don’t let that happen.”
(03:30:13)
And you’ve got to know why you’re strong on the issues you’re strong on. You’ve got to know why you’re strong on affordability and safety and security in the border and family care for men and women and law and order and your core values, for your children’s education and our military. Know why you’re where you are and when you come to your friends and coworkers being bullied, don’t be a bystander. Don’t be a bystander. You can’t let it happen.
(03:30:45)
When you say you love America, that’s a verb. That also means you love Americans. You’ve got to push back and call out the bullies. You’ve got to stand with those that have targets in their lives, targets, if they’re picking on them by calling their jobs to get them fired, boycotts or kicking them out of their jobs at church or their groups at church. I’ve spent 45 years listening to people and I was just in North Carolina after the hurricane hit down there, and you know what? I saw neighbors helping neighbors and not one of them asked are you a Democrat or a Republican? I saw neighbors helping neighbors. And we need to unify this country. You have the right to vote for who you want to vote for for president, and we need to step up and claim it and we need to stand with each other. There are so many who want to, but they’re bullied, so they’re afraid to. And let me tell you something. One of the most important days in American history was 9/12/2001. Not 9/11. We all know what happened on 9/11. One of the most important days was 9/12 because on 9/12 we all woke up and we were all Americans on 9/12.
(03:32:20)
If you were an American on 9/12, stand up right now. If you were an American on 9/12, stand up right now. That’s who we were. That’s who we are. And the difference between winners and losers is winners do things losers don’t want to do. And we have to stand proud to help our neighbors who want to vote their conscience and not be afraid. No one should be alone. No one should feel abandoned. No one should have their business boycotted. If you hear somebody’s getting their business boycotted, you should get your friends and make sure their business gets doubled. If somebody pulls their advertising from your friend’s business, you should let those advertisers know you’re going to spend their rest of your life making sure that advertiser is boycotted until they do the right thing.
(03:33:16)
You need to let people know, this is over in America. We’re going to unify this country. We’re going to listen and not be intimidated. We’re going to go out and lead by example. Let’s quit complaining about what is and start doing something about it. If your neighbor wants to vote the other way, say, fine, go vote the other way. I’ll love you anyway. Let’s lead by example. If they want to do it, let them do it. Love them anyway.
(03:33:47)
But as for you, the collective you, I don’t want you to just listen and say nice talk, Dr. Phil. I want you to march in your life. I want you to march with your beliefs. I want you to not be intimidated. Don’t be stopped and don’t just vote. Take five people with you. Like I said, the difference between winners and losers is winners do things losers don’t want to do and what they do is they take actions toward known outcomes. They deal with the truth, they set goals and they go after them with passion. And it’s time for us to bring it home.
(03:34:28)
It’s time for us to bring it home. It’s time for us to be winners. Winners, winners, winners. I started by telling you I love this country, I’ll finish by telling you I love this country, and I love you for loving this country. God bless you and God bless the United States of America. And before I leave, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next Vice President of the United States Senator JD Vance.

Vivek Ramaswamy (03:36:29):

It is an honor to be here with all of you at Madison Square Garden. Now, think about this: For more than a century, America’s most celebrated heroes and legends have made history inside this iconic arena. Where we stand is where the greatest of all time, Muhammad Ali, faced Joe Frazier in the fight of the century. It’s where the king, Elvis Presley, played for 80,000 screaming fans. It’s where the immortal Hulk Hogan pinned the Iron Sheik and let Hulkamania run wild. And now, on the eve of the most important election in our history, the greatest champion of them all, Donald J. Trump, has come to Madison Square Garden. And I believe, in just eight short days, we are going to turn the United States of America red and make Donald J. Trump the President of the United States. Now, my friends, I’ve got the easiest job in American politics. Think about this: All I’ve got to do is remind people what life was like when Donald J. Trump was President of the United States. We had peace, we had prosperity. Take home pay was rising the fastest that it had in 40 years. Inflation was at 1.5%, the lowest that it had been in a generation. Gas and groceries were affordable. And when Donald Trump was President, we had the most secure border in the history of this country. That’s the Donald Trump record and that’s a record that’s going to win in just nine short days. Now, I’m going to maybe surprise a little bit of the folks in this arena because I’m going to be a little bipartisan here. I’m going to talk about Governor Tim Walz and I got to be honest with you, I feel bad for him. No, no, no. We ought to spare a prayer for Governor Tim Walz because he’s got the hardest job in American politics. He’s got to convince the… You all can say that. I probably shouldn’t say that. But think about… Our friend Tim Walz has got to convince the American people that Kamala Harris is going to somehow fix the very problem she’s been creating over the last three and a half years. He’s got to pretend that Kamala Harris didn’t open up the southern border and let millions of illegal aliens in, even though we know she did. He’s got to pretend that Kamala Harris didn’t cast the deciding vote on trillions of dollars of new spending, which created the worst affordability crisis in 40 years in this country. And he’s got to pretend that Kamala Harris actually has ideas in her head for how to govern the United States of America.
(03:40:36)
Now, if you are the praying type, and I imagine a lot of us are, please say a prayer for Tim Walz because they’re asking him to do the impossible. Kamala Harris acts like she’s the candidate of change when she’s been in office for four years. She says she can fix everything. But Kamala, day one was 1400 days ago. What the hell have you been doing that whole time?
(03:41:08)
Now, my favorite Kamala Harris moment is that when somebody asks her for specifics on how she’ll make life more affordable or groceries cheaper, she’ll say, “I grew up in a middle class family.” You say “Kamala Harris, how are you going to close down the southern border because for four years you’ve left it wide open?” And she’ll say, “I made the hash browns when I worked at McDonald’s and I was pretty good at it.” And anybody with a lick of common sense is saying, “Kamala Harris, you didn’t answer the question. You didn’t actually tell the American people how you’re going to fix what you broke.” And I got to be honest with you, even on that McDonald’s answer, I’m not sure that she ever worked at McDonald’s. In fact, I think our president, Donald J. Trump, has probably worked at McDonald’s for longer than Kamala Harris has.
(03:42:11)
Now, I’m going to say one thing in Kamala Harris’s defense. She does one thing very well. Look at this. You guys. You weren’t expecting me to be so bipartisan, but I will say this for Kamala, that every time she does an interview, I think Donald Trump picks up about 100,000 votes.
(03:42:43)
Now, we’re, of course, in one of the proud baseball cities in the United States of America, so you know the problem with a softball interview is that you’ve got to be able to hit a softball still. And that’s the problem with Kamala Harris is I don’t think that she could hit a tee ball based on what we’ve seen over the last couple of weeks. When she was asked what she would do differently, compared to Joe Biden, she said, “Nothing comes to mind.” She’s running. She’s running on how she’s going to be different, but she couldn’t name a single thing that she would do differently than Joe Biden. Now, I will say, that could be the Kamala Harris official campaign slogan. Kamala Harris, nothing comes to mind.
(03:43:35)
Now, the other day, CNN asked if she had made any mistakes as Vice President. Now, here’s what she actually said, and I’m quoting word for word. She said, “In my role as Vice President, I’ve probably worked very hard at making sure that I am well versed on issues and I think that is very important.” It’s a mistake not to be well versed on an issue and feel compelled to answer a question.
(03:44:20)
Now, I have no idea what any of that means and, frankly, neither do any of you. None of us know what the hell she says. Now, she may not be able to name any of her mistakes, but the American people sure can. And nine days from now, we’re going to tell Kamala Harris, you’re fired, go back to San Francisco where you belong. Get the hell out of the White House.
(03:44:53)
Now, together, Donald J. Trump and all of us, as part of this movement, are going to unleash a golden age of American prosperity. We’re going to make life affordable again in the United States of America. We’re going to put the American dream of home ownership within reach for millions of American young people. We’re going to secure our border and we’re going to keep our family safe. We’re going to protect your right to free speech and religious liberty. And we’re going to do it all thanks to the leadership of one man.
(03:45:42)
Now, we have to remember, that one man, Donald J. Trump, eight years ago, go back eight years, he had everything. He had fame, he had fortune, he had family, he had friends, but he gave up the easy life to save the United States of America. When they couldn’t beat him, they tried to bankrupt him. When that didn’t work, they tried to impeach him. When that didn’t work, they tried to put him in federal prison. And when that didn’t work, they even tried to kill him. But as sure as the American flag still waves, Donald Trump still stands ready to fight, ready to win, and ready to make America great again. God bless you all. Thank you so much. Let’s do it.

Speaker 65 (03:47:28):

Please welcome Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization, Eric Trump, and co-chair of the Republican National Committee, Lara Trump.

Eric Trump (03:48:40):

New York City. The greatest president we have ever had is right behind us, let’s make some noise for him. Guys, this isn’t politics. This isn’t politics. This is a family. It’s hard… But we love you too. We love you too. This is so much more than a political movement. This is the greatest family in the world. We are fighting for a country we love. We are fighting for the American flag. We are fighting for the Constitution. We are fighting for our liberty. And as a family, we’ve been out there every single day over the last 10 years.
(03:49:38)
They’ve tried everything they could to destroy my father, to destroy us. Dirty dossiers, Russian hoaxes. They tried to impeach him twice. They went after his Supreme Court nominees. They threw him off of Facebook. They threw him off of Twitter. They threw him off of Instagram. They tried to take away his first amendment right. Guys, they tried absolutely everything. They weaponized every DA and every AG in this country to try and take down my father. Here in New York, they did exactly that. Alvin Bragg, Letitia James. They tried to destroy his life.
(03:50:26)
They tried to take him off the ballot in Colorado. They tried to take him off the ballot in Maine. They tried to subdue the vote of literally hundreds of millions of Americans who absolutely adore the guy. Guys, it’s been political lawfare every single day. And then somebody tried to kill him. And despite that, every single time he stands up and he says, fight, fight, fight. And how do you think it feels for them, as we’re back in Madison Square

Eric Trump (03:51:00):

… Garden, the greatest arena anywhere in the world. Guys, I saw the Rangers play here and win the cup in ’94, every Knicks game, every concert, the greatest arena anywhere in the world. And you better believe the entire party who has failed at taking down Donald Trump, an entire party who has failed at taking down his family, they’re sitting there on those cameras right now watching all of us, watching all of you. Almost 200,000 people tried to get into this event tonight.

Audience (03:51:44):

USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.

Eric Trump (03:52:16):

The streets, Fifth Avenue, all the way from Trump Tower, all the way down to Madison Square Garden, 10 people deep. That’s how much love there is in the greatest city anywhere in the world. Guys, in nine days, we’re going to win. We’re going to win. And not only is he going to make America great again, he’s going to make New York City great again. So on behalf of our entire family, thank you. Thank you for being on the greatest ride I could have ever possibly been a part of. Thank you for 10 incredible years. I want you to know, and I speak on behalf of my entire family. I want you to know that we will never stop fighting. My father will never stop fighting. Lord will never stop fighting. I’ll never stop fighting. We live in the greatest country in the world. We are not going to allow that to slip away. And I promise you guys, the best days of this nation are ahead of us. I love you very much. New York, it’s an honor to be here.

Speaker 66 (03:53:42):

All right. Y’all, aren’t done with us just yet. I’ll say a few things if that’s okay with everybody here. Can I just say how honored I am to be the co-chair of the Republican National Committee for you guys? I’ll tell you something, we’re making sure that we have free, fair, and transparent elections and nobody’s cheating in 2024. Guys, we are nine days away from making sure we send a loud and clear message to the mainstream media, to the establishment, to the Democrats, to Hollywood, that it is not them. It is we, the people who choose our president. And we’re choosing Donald J. Trump.
(03:54:37)
And I got to tell you, it is incredible to be here in Madison Square Garden, in New York City, the greatest city on Earth, in the greatest country on Earth, the United States of America. Because if you think about it, New York City made Donald Trump, right? But Donald Trump also made New York City.
(03:55:06)
He changed the skyline of this city, rebuilt it. Remember whenever they couldn’t get an ice skating rink, Wolman Rink in Central Park? Donald Trump rebuilt the ice skating rink for New York City. By the way, under budget and ahead of schedule if I’m not mistaken, because that’s how we like to do things in the Trump family. And when nobody else was doing it, Donald Trump put his heart and soul right here in New York City. It’s true. And this is the city that made him a household name. This is the city that put Donald Trump in so many rap songs, by the way, right? And truly made him the American dream.
(03:55:52)
But I’ll tell you something, being a New Yorker teaches you something else, doesn’t it? It teaches you how to be tough. It teaches you that it doesn’t matter how hard you get hit, you get back up and you keep fighting.

Audience (03:56:08):

Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.

Speaker 66 (03:56:16):

When they impeach you, you keep fighting. When they indict you, you keep fighting. When they take a mugshot of you, the greatest mugshot in the history of the world, you keep fighting. And when an assassin’s bullet strikes you, you don’t lay down. You get up, you stand strong, and you keep fighting. Right? Now, in case you don’t know, Donald Trump likes to go places nobody expects him. Anybody hear about a little rally up the street in the Bronx?

Audience (03:57:05):

Yeah.

Speaker 66 (03:57:07):

Does anybody know the last time a Republican president campaigned in the Bronx? It was Ronald Reagan, and ladies and gentlemen, he turned New York red. I’m just saying, it is the honor of my life to be part of this movement. And Eric is right, this is not just about politics. We are all a big family and we’re a family who loves this country. And I can tell you something, nine days from now, it is going to be the sweetest comeback because we know the art of the deal. We also know the art of the comeback from Donald Trump that this country has ever seen. Everybody get out, vote early, take a friend to vote. Let’s make America great again. We love you New York.

Speaker 67 (03:59:07):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, Donald Trump, Jr.

Donald Trump, Jr. (03:59:45):

Wow. Hello, Madison Square Garden. Are you guys ready to take your country back?

Audience (03:59:53):

Yeah.

Donald Trump, Jr. (03:59:55):

Are you sick of the insanity?

Audience (03:59:59):

Yeah.

Donald Trump, Jr. (04:00:00):

Guys, this is not my first rodeo. This is the third go around. But you think this could have ever happened four or eight years ago in the heart of New York City?

Audience (04:00:12):

No.

Donald Trump, Jr. (04:00:16):

The king of New York is back to reclaim the city that he built. My father changed the skyline of this city. He fixed the things that incompetent bureaucrats couldn’t handle. He did that against all odds. He did it for our country too. And now everyone recognizes it. What’s unique about this election, folks, you’ve had four years under both leaders. The media would like to pretend that Kamala Harris started her political career about a month ago in a coup. The most democratic process to ever not have a single vote. She’s going to be a moderate, folks. She’s going to be a moderate. A radical San Francisco liberal. The daughter of a Marxist professor is now magically going to be a moderate. No one’s buying it anymore. You know why? Because they’ve been lying to you for the last nine years and you are not buying their crap anymore. You’ve had enough. The fact that I could drive here today with my father for like 25 blocks and watch the streets of New York lined up with red MAGA hats tells us everything you need to know. You had four years under Donald Trump and despite the most vicious opposition from the media, from big tech, from the Democrats, and even from the weakling Republicans, you got results. We got peace deals done. Our enemies weren’t invading their neighbors. The economy grew. Inflation was next to nothing. And then Kamala Harris and Joe Biden took over and everything went to hell like that. I keep watching it in the news. It’s amazing. Kamala Harris is going to fix all these things. I say, “You know what? Why hasn’t she started fixing them? You’ve had four years. Why didn’t you maybe get going? You’re going to wait until January 20th? Americans are suffering. People can’t make rent. Businesses are going under. Grocery prices are too expensive.”
(04:03:21)
I tell a story, last summer, last summer, I was coming back from a fishing trip with two of my boys, and we went to McDonald’s. And it was $48 for a 10-year-old, a 14-year-old, and me. And guys, let me tell you, if Donald Trump, Jr. has sticker shock at McDonald’s, we have a serious problem. It does not have to be this way, guys. We can change it, but it’s going to take all of you. These days, everyone is a tough guy. Everyone is a tough guy on the keyboard, on the internet. Everyone is a badass. But when you get shot in the face and you come back defiant ready to fight, that’s a badass. That’s the guy. That’s the guy that can fix the problems that we have. That’s the guy that’s going to keep our enemies in check.
(04:04:26)
That’s a guy that’s going to fight for each and every one of you. He’s done it once. Let’s send him back to Washington DC with an overwhelming mandate to fix the nonsense once and for all. Guys, look at the people who have spoken here tonight and look at some of the people who are still coming. When did you think you’d be able to get RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Elon Musk.
(04:05:09)
People from all different walks of life, incredible skill sets, whether it be health, whether it be technology, everything. You have them on one unified ticket. Think about that. Compare that to Kamala Harris and Tampon Tim. It ain’t the same folks. Timmy ain’t fixing anything and neither is Kamala. We have a once in a lifetime opportunity to change, to change Washington, to put in common sense practices, to put Americans first, because they’re not first right now.
(04:05:52)
The Democrat party has forgotten about Americans. Rather than cater to Americans, they decided, “You know what? It would just be easier to replace them with people who will be reliable voters.” The insanity has to stop. And the fact that we can pack Madison Square Garden in the heart of New York City shows me that the spirit of the American people is there. That same spirit my father showed on July 13th, that’s the spirit of America. That’s the spirit we need going into election day.
(04:06:31)
So for the next nine days, each and every one of you, you line up like you’re the third monkey on line for the ark, and it’s starting to rain. You vote, you vote early, and then you bring your friends so that we can take back our country once and for all.
(04:06:56)
And when we do that, guys, we’re not just going to make America great again, we’re going to make the world great. We’re going to make the world safe. We’re going to fix it all. Get out there guys, and just like you’re going to fight, get out there and vote, vote, vote. Thank you, New York City. Love you guys.

Dana White (04:08:37):

Ladies and gentlemen, we are nine days away from the most important election of my lifetime. Stakes have never been higher, and the choice has never been clearer. President Trump and I have been friends for 25 years. I’ve said this before and I’m going to say it again. He is the most resilient, hardest working human being that I’ve ever met in my life. I know he’s a great leader. This is not my opinion, not my hope. He’s proven he can build the strongest economy in American history. He’s proven he can secure our borders and keep our nation safe.
(04:09:27)
He’s proven to be the strong leader, allies and adversaries alike must respect. He’s proven he loves this country so much, he’s literally put his life on the line for it. What has the other candidate proven? She can get your party’s nomination without even facing voters. What else? What else can she offer the American people other than vague promises and no plan? She talks a lot about the need for change and her hope for the future. Hope and change. Does that sound familiar?
(04:10:13)
She can use the old Obama playbook, but she’s not Obama and she is no agent of change. She is the sitting vice president of the United States right now. What she hopes is voters will focus on the future because she doesn’t want us looking at the last four years to see what we really need to change. We need change from sky high inflation. According to Yahoo Finance, the cost of groceries is up over 25% during the Biden-Harris administration. Food is unaffordable for most Americans. That has to change. We need change from wide open borders.
(04:10:57)
BBC News reports illegal immigration reached record levels since they took office with an estimated 10 million border crossings. That’s a 300% increase compared to the Trump administration, and that’s not included in the unknown millions who cross undetected. That is the record of the other candidate, the border czar of the Biden administration.
(04:11:27)
We need change from week foreign policy. According to the Institute for Economics and Peace, a nonpartisan think tank, think about this, there are more active armed conflicts now than anytime since World War II. Weakness from the Biden-Harris administration has invited aggression and conflicts around the globe. When President Trump was our commander-in-chief, the world was a much more peaceful place. JD Vance touched on this, but I want to hit it again. Vice President Harris was asked recently by the objective journalists of The View. If there’s anything she would’ve done differently than Biden over the past four years. And again, her answer was, there is not a thing that comes to mind. So don’t take my word for it, take hers. She will not change a thing. Hope is nice, but hope is not a plan. Change is needed, but change won’t come from the status quo, and she is the status quo.
(04:12:46)
If you want real change, you’ll vote for proven leadership. If you want to return to economic prosperity, border security, and global stability, you’ll vote for the one candidate who’s proven he can deliver all of that. My fellow Americans. If you want what’s best for your family in this country, you’re going to vote. Donald J. Trump as the 47th President of the United States. Thank you, New York. Have a good night.

Hello, New York. I mean, it was not on my bucket list, okay? People like me, do not get to play Madison Square Garden. This place rocks. All right. Most of you in New York, maybe you know my story. My company is called Cantor Fitzgerald, and we were located on the 101st to the hundred and 105th floors of the World Trade Center. I get to be here today because I was taking my son Kyle to his first day of kindergarten that morning, 23 years ago. I lost 658 of my friends and colleagues.
(04:15:25)
I had 960 who worked in New York that day and we lost 658 people. And we rebuilt that company to take care of the families of those that I lost. So we took care of those families. Each of my employees, they took 25% of their salaries and they gave it to the families of the people we lost because that’s what New Yorkers do, and we gave those families $180 million. So the first thing, we must elect Donald J. Trump president because we must crush Jihad.
(04:16:51)
I love this city. I love this city. And Donald Trump loves this city. No matter how crappy they treat him, he is back because he loves you and he loves this city. We all say make America great again. But let’s just go over for a minute what that means because we all say it as a slogan. When was America great? At the turn of the century, our economy was rocking. This is 1900, 125 years ago. We had no income tax, and all we had was tariffs. All we had was tariffs. And we had so much money that we had the greatest businessmen of America get together to try to figure out how to spend it.
(04:18:04)
That’s who we were then. But then we had World War I and we had World War II, and we felt we had a duty to rebuild the rest of the world. So here’s what we did. We took down our protection, we took down our tariffs, and we turned instead, and we taxed Americans so that we could export the power of our economy and save the rest of the world, which we did.
(04:18:42)
Now, let me ask you a question. What decade should that have ended? Should it have ended in the ’80s, the ’90s, 2000? What in the world are we doing? We’re letting the rest of the world eat our lunch, and it is time to make America great again.
(04:19:19)
All right. What does America first mean? We all say America first. What does America first mean? American citizens employed first. NAFTA. NAFTA? Bill Clinton’s favorite I hate Michigan move. Open the border, take all car manufacturing and move it to Mexico and screw over everyone in America who works in the auto industry. We don’t make cars here. I mean, they make our cars in China and ship them here. It’s got to end. So when he says America first, let’s be crystal clear. He’s saying employ American citizens first. Okay. The Harris-Biden administration has set us up with a $6.5 trillion spending budget on our taxes of $4. 5 trillion as they screw our children’s future to the wall. We lose $2 trillion this year, 2 trillion. And Donald Trump is going to build the greatest team to ever walk into government. And we are going to balance our budget. And when we balance our budget, the world is going to feel what it feels like to unleash the full power of the United States economy and its amazing workforce. Okay. So ladies and gentlemen, I have the honor to introduce the co-founder with me of the Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE. Madison Square Garden, ladies and gentlemen, give it up for the greatest capitalist in the history of the United States of America, Elon Musk. All right.

Elon Musk (04:23:06):

As you can see, I’m not just MAGA, I’m dark, gothic MAGA. The energy in this room is incredible. What a great group of people.

Howard Lutnick (04:23:33):

All right. I’ve only got one question for you, and then I’m getting out of here because this is your stage. But we set up DOGE.

Elon Musk (04:23:39):

Yes.

Howard Lutnick (04:23:40):

How much do you think we can rip out of this wasted $6.5 trillion Harris-Biden budget?

Elon Musk (04:23:49):

Well, I think we can do at least 2 trillion.

Howard Lutnick (04:23:50):

Yeah.

Elon Musk (04:23:50):

Yes.

Howard Lutnick (04:23:50):

2 trillion.

Elon Musk (04:23:56):

I mean, at the end of the day, you’re being taxed. You’re

Speaker 68 (04:24:00):

… being taxed. All government spending is taxation. So whether it’s direct taxation or… All government spending, either it becomes inflation or it’s direct taxation. Your money is being wasted and the Department of Government Agency is going to fix that. We’re going to get the government off your back and out of your pocketbook. And America’s not just going to be great, America is going to reach heights that it has never seen before. The future is going to be amazing.

Speaker 68 (04:25:39):

Yes. Now I have something I want to ask you to do though, because obviously we’re somewhat preaching to the converted in this stadium, but there’s a lot of people out there who need to vote for President Trump. Okay. So this is a real battle. This is a real election battle. So you need to get friends and family to vote. Make sure they vote early. This is important. We’re going to be putting up a scorecard, an early vote scorecard, state by state, county by county. What is the scorecard? Vote early. Vote now. Yeah. Make the margin of victory so big that you know what can’t happen.
(04:26:55)
Massive, overwhelming sweep of every swing state and even some of the states that people don’t think are swing states. Massive crushing victory. Get everyone, friends, family, people on the street. Put the signs up, put the hat on. Let’s go. And with that, it is my honor to introduce the First Lady, Melania Trump.

Good evening, New York City. Hello, Madison Square Garden, our hometown, where architectural symbols of strength, courage, and unity create a canvas for the world’s undisputed capital of industry, where tidings of finance, fashion, and entertainment convene among an iconic range of superior design, structures and accomplishments, and American [inaudible 04:30:09] blossoms among determined citizens who race across city streets and between offices striving for success. It is you who are the heartbeat of this great metropolis. It’s you who are the poles of this America. Yet, New York City is unforgiving. In fact, our lives are complicated even during the best of times. And sadly today, a declining quality of life coupled with economic instability makes it difficult for business to thrive. Love you too.
(04:31:09)
Crime is on the rise, while public safety diminishes, creating an environment where families with young children choose to relocate. And this story repeats itself from coast to coast across our nation. This is America. For generations, this town has produced America’s most fearless leaders whose mark changed the course of the world. New York City and America needs their magic back. A country of tomorrow that will shape our future and reset expectations for the generations. Envision a wonderful America where the seeds of security, prosperity, and health are sown once again for benefit of our families. Let us charge together with a shared vision that builds on American greatness. Let’s seize this moment and create a country for tomorrow, the future that we deserve.

Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you very much to a very popular former First Lady, hopefully First Lady again. And I just want to say a very big hello to a special place, New York, and to an incredible arena, Madison Square Garden. Incredible. And then we have all of the people that could fill it up 10 times. You take a look at outside what’s going on all the way down to the river, the beautiful, beautiful Hudson River. They’re outside watching this now at levels that nobody’s ever seen before. They’ve never had it. And I want to thank Jim Dolan. He’s been incredible. He’s been just incredible. The job they’ve done, job they’ve done. Thank you. But I’m thrilled to be back in the city I love and thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots, you’re with me. We’re all together. We’ve always been together. And I’d like to begin by asking a very simple question. Are you better off now than you were four years ago? I’m here today with a message of hope for all Americans. With your vote in this election, I will end inflation. I will stop the invasion of criminals coming into our country and I will bring back the American Dream. We need the American Dream to come back home. Our country will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer, and stronger than ever before. This election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of gross incompetence and failure, or whether we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country. We will achieve success that no one can imagine. We will have the strongest economy, the most secure borders, the safest cities, the most powerful military, the best trade deals, and we will dominate the frontiers of science, medicine, business, technology and space.
(04:40:03)
And I’m asking you to be excited about the future of our country again. I’m asking you to dream big again. We’re going to dream big again. We haven’t been dreaming big at all. This will be America’s new golden age. It’s going to happen quickly too, very quickly. Every problem facing us can be solved, but now the fate of our nation is in your hands. Next Tuesday you have to stand up and you have to tell Kamala Harris that, “You’ve done a terrible job. That crooked Joe Biden has done a terrible job. You’ve destroyed our country. We’re not going to take it anymore. Kamala, you are fired. Get out. Get out. You’re fired.”
(04:41:12)
Early voting is underway in every swing state, and we are setting all-time records. The voting, I tell you what, I don’t want to talk about it, but we have to keep it going. You got to get out and vote. We just have to get out. And who would’ve thought this was going to happen? We’re leading in every swing state, but it doesn’t mean a thing. It only means how are we doing at the end? We have nine days from now and we’re going to defeat Kamala Harris and we’re going to win back the beautiful White House and we’re going to make America great again and it’s going to happen fast.

Crowd (04:42:01):

USA, USA, USA, USA.

Donald Trump (04:42:10):

Thank you.

USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.

Donald Trump (04:42:18):

In less than four years, Kamala Harris has shattered our middle class. She cast the deciding votes that launched the worst inflation in the history of our country. She cost the typical American family over $3,000 in a short period, but over $30,000 over the last three years. She killed 50,000 manufacturing jobs this year alone. Now, Kamala wants to raise the typical family taxes by nearly $3,000 a year and impose a 33% tax hike on all domestic production. If Kamala Harris gets four more years, our economy can never recover. If I win, we will quickly build the greatest economy in the history of the world, which is what we had in our last term. We will rapidly defeat inflation and we will very simply make America affordable again. We’re going to make it affordable.
(04:43:51)
I will massively cut taxes for workers and small businesses, and we will have no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on social security benefits for our seniors. And I’m announcing a new policy today that I will support a tax credit for family caregivers who take care of a parent or a loved one. It’s about time that they were recognize, right? They add so much to our country and are never spoken of, ever, ever, ever. But they’re going to be spoken of now. Thank you all very much. I’ll also make interest on car loans fully tax-deductible, but only for cars made in America. Have to be made in America. And we will achieve energy independence and we will do something. We want it so badly. We’re going to do something.
(04:45:11)
You know what we’re going to do front row Joes? You know I got front row Joes here. I got the ladies from North Carolina number 249. This is the 249, and you look so beautiful. We have a lot of people, they followed us. But we are going to do something. The ladies can tell you what we’re going to do. We’re going to drill a baby drill and I will terminate the green new scam and we’ll cut your energy prices in half. 50% within one year from January 20th. Is the fake news hearing that? Whoa. Look how much. Wow. That’s a lot of fake news. That is a lot of fake news. Look at that. Wow. That’s got to be a record Mr. Speaker. I think that’s a record. That is a lot of fakers back there. To bring back millions of jobs, we will give our companies the lowest taxes, the lowest energy costs, the lowest regulatory burdens, and free access to the best and biggest market on the planet.
(04:46:31)
Remember this, if we keep going like this, we won’t have the biggest and the best. We won’t have a market. We won’t have a country. But only for those who make their product here in the USA and hire American workers for the job, and if these companies don’t make their products here, then they will pay a very stiff tariff when they send their products into the United States for the privilege of competing with our workers and our now protected companies. We’re going to protect our companies. They’re not leaving anymore. They’re not leaving anymore. We’re also going to pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act, meaning if China or any other country charges us 100% or 200% tax or tariff, we will then charge them a 100% or 200% tax or tariff. It’s called an eye for an eye.
(04:47:33)
And I will never apologize for defending America. I will protect our workers. I will protect our jobs. I will protect our borders. I will protect our great families, and I will protect the birthright of our children to live in the richest and most powerful nation on the face of the earth. As we rescue our economy, I will also restore our borders. There’s never been anything like it. It’s bigger than inflation. It’s bigger than the economy. What they’re doing to our country, they’re allowing criminals from all over the world to enter our country. Over the past four years, Kamala Harris has orchestrated the most egregious betrayal that any leader in American history has ever inflicted upon our people. She has violated her oath, eradicated our sovereign border, and unleashed an army of migrant gangs who are waging a campaign of violence and terror against our citizens. There has never been anything like it anywhere in the world for any country. Kamala has imported criminal migrants from prisons and jails, insane asylums and mental institutions from all around the world, from Venezuela to the Congo. A lot of people are coming from the Congo prisons.
(04:49:10)
They’re coming from all over the world. Over the last month, 181 countries violated our laws and she has resettled them into your communities to prey upon innocent American citizens. But the day I take the oath of office, the migrant invasion of our country ends and the restoration of our country begins. One of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gangs that Kamala has imported into our country is the savage Venezuelan prison gang. Nice group of people. They got together in prison. The worst prison in the world, they say. It’s called Tren de Aragua. And that is taking over apartment complexes and unleashing a violent killing spree all over America, and especially in Aurora, Colorado, where we have a governor who’s petrified of them and maybe he should be. But now they’ve even taken over Times Square. Take a look.

The United States is now an occupied country, but it will soon be an occupied country no longer. Not going to be happening. Not going to be happening. November 5th, 2024, nine days from now will be Liberation Day in America. It’s going to be Liberation Day. On day one, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. Going to get the criminals out. I will rescue every city in town that has been invaded and conquered and we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail. Going to kick them the hell out of our country as fast as possible. And to expedite removals of Tren de Aragua and other savage gangs like MS-13, which is equally vicious. I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Think of that. That’s how far back. That’s when they had law and order. They had some tough ones. Think of it. the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. You hear that Mr. Speaker? Get ready to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil. And there are lots of them.
(04:54:32)
We don’t have the same country anymore. You know that. And when you look at the polls and they say about the economy, and they have all these different things, the worst nightmare that we’re facing is what they’ve done to us on our borders. We had the safest border in the world. In fact, there’s a chart, which I hope they have because I didn’t tell them I wanted it. But there’s a chart that I love very much because I wouldn’t be here without it. That’s it. I love it. I’m in love with it. I love that chart. Even if it had bad numbers, I would’ve loved that chart. But it doesn’t. It has great numbers. And if you look at the arrow on the bottom, you’ll see that was the day I left office. That was the lowest illegal immigration that we’ve ever had in the recorded history of our country. And then look at it. It was like an Elon Musk rocket ship. Look at what happens. Look at what happened after that. And if they come back into our country, it’s an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole.
(04:55:55)
And I’m hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer.

Donald Trump (04:56:25):

Under Kamala, America is a sanctuary for criminals. And for illegal aliens that are in our country illegally, I will immediately ban all sanctuary cities in the United States. Kamala’s gross incompetence disqualifies her from being president of the United States of America. She is grossly incompetent. All you have to do is look at her interviews. Look at what she did the other night

Donald Trump (04:57:00):

… tonight on fake news, CNN, just take a look. She couldn’t answer a question. She’s unfit for office. Everyone knows it. No one respects her. No one trusts her. No one takes her seriously. Everyone knows she is a very low IQ individual. From humiliating our country in Afghanistan to the war in Ukraine to the nightmare on our border to her inflation catastrophe, all done in conjunction with Sleepy Joe. But he was largely sleeping, wasn’t he? After four o’clock, it’s time to go to bed. To his and her egregious hurricane response, the worst response in North Carolina and other states since Katrina, but I think it was even worse than Katrina. They haven’t even responded in North Carolina. They haven’t even responded. There’s nobody… They don’t see any FEMA. You know why? They spent their money on bringing in illegal migrants so they didn’t have money for Georgia and North Carolina and Alabama and Tennessee and Florida and South Carolina.
(04:58:17)
They didn’t have any money for them. They spent all of their money on bringing in illegal immigrants and flying them in by beautiful jet planes. They flew in. We just found out about a year and a half ago. Remember, we said, “What’s going on? A lot of planes going over there. What are they?” They would fly them into the middle of our country, our beautiful, beautiful country. And you know what happened? You take a look at Springfield, Ohio. Think of this. Think of this, where 30,000 illegal migrants were put into a town of 50,000 people. No place can withstand that. Or take a look at Aurora in Colorado. Colorado is going to vote for us. You know why? Typically, they go a little bit the other way. Of course, with their voting system, I’m not so sure about that. But you know why? Because they tried to throw the leading candidate of both parties, meaning me… I was leading both parties off the ballot. And the people of Colorado, including Democrats, are very angry about it. They are a threat to democracy, to use their term.
(04:59:36)
Isn’t it nice to have somebody that’s your president that doesn’t need a teleprompter? We haven’t been on teleprompter for a long time. I haven’t been on this teleprompter. No, it is nice. You saw the other day where Kamala got a little stuck on the teleprompter, went a little bad. It stopped doing… If you’re a politician, you have to be able to handle that. Remember, you have to do the weave, he says. Got to do the… You’ve got to do more than the weave. But it happens a lot as a politician. It happens… I mean, we have so many politicians here, great ones. Some are not so good, but great ones.
(05:00:19)
And when Newt or when the speaker or when Tommy Tuberville, who’s here someplace, the great senator from Alabama, or when any one of our literally 75… By the way, should I introduce all of them by name? I should. Should I? No? Yes? I don’t know. It’s a lot. Speaker, should I? I don’t know. Will they be angry? Yeah, they will. It’s a lot of introducing, right? Let’s keep going with this speech. But when you’re in this profession… I have a friend who wanted to come in. I said, “Do you like speaking?” “Well, I do, but I have a great fear of speaking.” I said, “Don’t be a politician.” If you have a fear of speaking, don’t be a politician. But one thing you have to know is that no matter how good your people are that operate this machinery, it’s going to break. And you’re going to be out there all by yourself a lot.
(05:01:22)
And you’ve got to be able to do so. Three weeks ago she was saying there was only 32 days left, right? And she’s reading it like, “Ah, it’s 32 days,” and it stopped. And she went this, “32 days, 32, 32…” And I was watching, I said, “This isn’t pretty.” 32, she was gone. And then damn it, it kicked back on. She was gone. We’ve had it. It happens a lot. And don’t forget, you got all those people back there. Now they don’t talk about her. But if that ever happened to me… It happens all the time. I was campaigning in Ohio for a very, very… Bernie Marino, he’s doing a good job. I think he’s maybe going to win in Ohio. The problem he’s got his opponent, Sherrod Brown, he’s taking ads in like he’s my best friend. He never votes for me. He’s not my best friend.
(05:02:33)
Ohio’s been very friendly to Trump. We win it all the time by a landslide. But the opponent is taking ads. I got four of them… I think we have four of them, right? They’re taking ads. All of a sudden, they love Trump. “We agree with Trump on tariffs. We agree with Trump on the border. We love Trump.” And they are Democrats. Their friends are calling up, “Did they switch to the Republican party?” But it happened with Bernie Marino. I was in Ohio to try and get him over the initial primary hump and it was 45 mile an hour winds. And these suckers were blowing like… You ever try reading a teleprompter where it’s moving about two feet in each…?
(05:03:19)
But I didn’t have to worry about that because even worse, they ended up blowing off the stage, a lot of it. So I’m now in the first sentence and I got 28,000 people and millions of people watching on television, I got no teleprompter. And did I do a good job, Mr. Speaker? And he won. And he won, huh? Thank you, Matt. And he won. See, when you’re up there all along, we don’t go, “32, 32, 32. Oh my God.” Kamala Harris is a train wreck who has destroyed everything in her path. To make her president would be a gamble with the lives of millions and millions of people. She would get us into World War III. We’re very close to World War III. If you don’t have a smart president, if you don’t have a president that gets it, if you don’t have a president that is respected by the other side… And they did respect us four years ago.
(05:04:17)
They really respected us. Iran was broke. They had no money. Russia wouldn’t have played with us at all. Russia would’ve never gone into Ukraine. Israel, October 7th would never, ever have happened, would’ve never have happened. All those people would be alive right now, those people that were killed on that horrible day. But if you don’t have a president that gets it… You know what else you wouldn’t have had? You wouldn’t have had the most embarrassing day in the history of our country, in my opinion, Afghanistan, the way they… Not that they got out. We were getting out, but we were going to get out with dignity and strength. We got out an embarrassment, the likes of which this country has never suffered. And because of that, Putin looked at us and they probably figured we were a paper tiger and he went into Ukraine and the rest is history.
(05:05:10)
It would’ve never happened with us and you wouldn’t have had any inflation. We had the best economy, we had no inflation. And inflation has destroyed a lot of seniors on fixed income and a lot of people in this room have been virtually destroyed by inflation. You wouldn’t have had inflation. They screwed up our energy and it went up so much. And then they started spending far too much money on things like the Green New scam, which is just a scam, just a complete scam. They actually admitted that if you think about it. But she would get us into World War III because she’s incompetent. Can’t do the job, unfit for it. And then all of your sons and daughters will end up getting a little notice. They’ll say, “Mom, dad, what is this little green piece of paper?” ” Darling, that’s a draft notice. They’re drafting you to go and fight in some country that I’ve never heard… I’ve never heard of this country before. Oh no, I don’t want my baby to fight. I don’t want my baby to be killed.”
(05:06:17)
What they did in Afghanistan with those 13 great soldiers, I’ve gotten to know the parents so well and leaving all of that equipment behind and leaving Americans behind, and many, many people with no legs and no arms, all because of incompetent people. But we don’t want your sons and daughters to get a little draft notice and you have to explain to them what it means. We’re tired of fighting. I’m the only president in the last 84 years that didn’t start a war. Remember Crooked Hillary? Remember Crooked Hillary Clinton? Crooked Hillary, oh, she was a beauty. During one of our many debates., She said, “Look at him. Listen to him. He’s going to start a war. Listen to his rhetoric. He’s going to start a war.”
(05:07:16)
I said, “No, no, no. My rhetoric is going to keep us out of wars.” And that’s what happened. 82 years… Other than I finished off ISIS but that was already started. We had stupid generals like Milley and Mattis, weak, stupid people, but fear not, we have great generals, just not the ones that you see on television all the time. And we wiped them out very quickly. It was going to take five years. Mattis said it would take five years, and, “I’m not sure we could do it.” It took us like four weeks. We have great generals. We have the greatest military in the world, just a lot of people don’t know that. And everybody knows it. I saw the other day a report that they issued that if we end up in a war with China, we cannot win. We’re not strong enough. So I said to myself, “Assuming that’s true, how stupid are you to put out a report like that? How stupid? Why would you put out a report?”
(05:08:20)
Then they’ll say, “Oh, Trump is not truthful.” No, I’m smart. You don’t put out reports like that. And it’s not true. We would kick their ass. It’s not true. Our enemies are laughing at her. They want her to win so badly. Oh, they don’t want Trump. They don’t want Trump. I’ve made this position a very dangerous one because of that, that’s why. It’s a very dangerous… If you drive a race car, you have one-tenth of 1% chance of dying. If you ride the bulls… I think the bulls are pretty nasty, right? You have about the same, one-tenth of 1% of dying. If you become president of the United States, you’ve got a hell of a shot at dying.
(05:09:17)
I never knew that when I ran. I never thought about it. But here we are. Here we are, and I’m okay with it. And I would rather be here than any place in the world. It’s called a very dangerous profession. But if we win, our enemies won’t be laughing anymore. They’re not going to be laughing. And you know what the truth is? I got along with all of them. I got along with Putin. Ukraine was the apple of his eye. But I said, “Vladimir, don’t go in.” Remember, I ended the pipeline in Europe. I ended the pipeline in Europe, and then when Biden came in, he approved it, but he ended the Keystone pipeline, the one in America. So he got it a little mixed up, didn’t he, huh? Nord Stream 2. I said, “We’re ending Nord Stream 2.” Everybody said, “What is Nord Stream 2?”
(05:10:17)
I said, “That’s the massive Russian pipeline where they’re going to make a fortune, where they’re going to Germany and all countries in Europe.” So I said, “You mean we’re fighting to help them with NATO and spending all of that money and they’re paying the person and the group that we’re fighting billions of dollars a month? What the hell are we doing?” I ended it. It was dead, and Biden came along and he approved it. Weak… Look, 30 years ago, he was not considered smart either. So now he’s really that smart. If we win, America will be respected and even if it’s necessary, feared again. It’s not the worst word. On issue after issue, Kamala broke it, but I will fix it. But we’re going to fix it.
(05:11:14)
But we’re just not running against Kamala. I think a lot of our politicians here tonight know this. She means nothing. She’s purely a vessel. That’s all she is. When you see her up there talking about, “The grass on my front lawn, I grew up in a middle class neighborhood and I had grass on my front lawn…” But we’re asking, “What would you do to fix the country? And why didn’t you do it yet? Almost four years, why didn’t you do this stuff?” Now she’s becoming more MAGA than those politicians I just told about from the different states. She can’t put two sentences together.
(05:11:57)
She’s really just like, in many ways, crooked Joe Biden. And she never said to us, she never told us that Joe was not functioning properly. She should have, because we’re talking about the life of the most important country in the world. We need very smart people. We’re running against something far bigger than Joe or Kamala and far more powerful than them, which is a massive, vicious, crooked, radical-left machine that runs today’s Democrat party. They’re just vessels. In fact, they’re perfect vessels because they’ll never give them a hard time. They’ll do whatever they want. I know many of them. It’s just this amorphous group of people, but they’re smart and they’re vicious, and we have to defeat them. And when I say the enemy from within, the other side goes crazy, becomes astounded. “Oh, how can he say…?” No, they’ve done very bad things to this country. They are indeed the enemy from within, but this is who we’re fighting. These are the people who are doing such harm to our country with their open border policies, record-setting inflation, Green New scam, and everything else that they’re doing. But we’re not going to let it happen any longer. We’re going to have the biggest victory in the history of our country on November 5th. It’s going to be the biggest victory in history. We’re going to make America great again, everybody. On top of it all, Kamala says she would not do one thing differently from Joe Biden, which is totally disqualifying. And you have to remember this, all of the mistakes he made… And you know what? Maybe it is the worst, but they’re all so bad.
(05:13:56)
Think of this. 325,000 children are missing, dead, sex slaves, or slaves. They came through the open border and they’re gone. Their parents will most likely never see them again, almost any of them. Think of the number, 325,000 children are missing or dead. Take a look at this, please.

Speaker 69 (05:14:25):

Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?

Kamala Harris (05:14:31):

There is not a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 71 (05:14:33):

I stood there on the tarmac watching you check your watch.

Speaker 70 (05:14:36):

The chaotic and deadly US evacuation from Afghanistan stunned Americans and the world and cost the lives of 13 US soldiers.

Speaker 69 (05:14:44):

Would you have done something differently?

Kamala Harris (05:14:46):

There is not a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 72 (05:14:48):

More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder have been caught at the border and then released into the United States.

Speaker 8 (05:14:55):

An Afghan national is in custody today after being accused of plotting an election- day terrorist attack. The subject entered the US on a special immigrant visa.

Speaker 73 (05:15:03):

Heart-wrenching new details in the murder of Georgia nursing student, Laken Riley. The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuelan national who crossed the unsecured southern border back in 2022. Two men, investigators say, are in the country illegally from Venezuela, are charged with capital murder in the death of Jocelyn Nungaray.

Speaker 74 (05:15:23):

A fifth illegal immigrant accused of attacking two New York City police officers over the weekend showed no remorse or regret.

Speaker 69 (05:15:30):

Would you have done something differently?

Kamala Harris (05:15:33):

There’s not a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 75 (05:15:35):

Only 18%. So the economy is in excellent or good condition.

Speaker 76 (05:15:39):

US inflation has hit a new forty-year high, increasing by 9.1% over the financial year.

Speaker 77 (05:15:45):

Authorities say Tren de Aragua, which has been linked with more than a hundred criminal investigations here in the US, has now been found operating its criminal enterprise in apartment complexes.

Speaker 69 (05:15:56):

Were you the last person in the room?

Kamala Harris (05:15:57):

Yes.

Donald Trump (05:16:05):

So if you want to end this disaster, you got to get out and vote. Just go out and vote. You got to get out. We have to put it away. We’re close. We’re so close. Usually the Republicans are losing in the first week and the early voting. Now we did something that has not been done. I don’t think, Speaker, this has been done yet, but it’s been done for us. We’re leading every one of the swing states, all seven of them. We usually get them from behind because Republicans like to vote on a thing called election day. In the old days, we had election days. Today we have election periods. They go on forever. And last time they went beyond and start early, start late, do whatever the hell you want. We got more votes in 2020 than any sitting president in history by millions. And we did great. Obviously in 2016 we won, but we did much better in 2020. But nothing compares to what’s happening. I mean, you have tens of thousands of people standing outside watching us on a television and we love you out there. We love you. They’re watching. But both of those great races, both of them don’t compare to what’s happening now. In Florida, we took a massive lead and all of these places… I mean, there’s something happening that’s really good. There’s something happening that’s really good. But let’s close it out. Pretend you’re one point down. Would everybody pretend? Let me just do a poll. Who has already voted?
(05:17:55)
Who is going to vote? That’s what I like. That would be better than the other way, if you’ve already voted. So I’d say 16, 17, maybe 20%. And we’re leading. And most of you haven’t voted, but you promise you’re going to vote? Everybody promise? Promise, Donald. There’s a lot of people in here. Well, the beauty is that a Republican likes to vote late and they like to vote and make sure their vote’s in the box. They want to vote. They just feel better about it. And so we had a lot of people voting, but really that’s the same… I do it in every event. I say, “Who’s voted?” For the last three events. Last night, I was at Penn State, a great place. I actually met, this is amazing, the national championship wrestling team. Penn State won the national championship. But listen to this, 11 out of the last 13 years… Even Jim Jordan would be impressed by that.
(05:19:03)
Jim Jordan is a great guy. He’s a great wrestler. All American wrestler, Jim. You can see it by the way he acts. Not afraid of anything, right? And I looked at those guys and they’re rough as hell. I said, “You may be the only people that can take Tren de Aragua in a fight.” And it won’t even be that easy for them. They’re tough people. But it was great to meet that team and those great champions, amazing, really great champions. And we were packed at Penn State. We were packed. No matter where we go, we’re packed, no matter where we go because there’s something happening and the something happening is they want to take back their country. People want to take back their country. You love the country. I love the country. We want to take it back.
(05:19:48)
I could be right now on the most beautiful beach in the world. I could be at Turnberry in Scotland. I own it. I could be anywhere. I got that greatest… I don’t have to be here, but I would much rather be at Madison Square Garden with you. So we’re thrilled to be joined today by an incredible group of patriots who are going to help us save our country, including our next vice president, JD Vance, and a man who was so incredible last week. I watched that rocket ship come down. I’ve never seen… I told this story last night. I was on the phone with a very, very important person. And I’m talking to him and I’m watching the television while I’m talking. And this guy’s boring as hell. And I said, “Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Wait a minute.”
(05:20:59)
I’m looking at the screen and I see this rocket pouring the fire, the flames. It’s all over the place. It was white a week ago and now it’s pitch black from the burning coming down at 10,000 miles an hour. It’s coming down at a… There he is. You know what he was doing for the last week? Campaigning in Pennsylvania. He’s a sweetheart too. So I’m talking to this guy, very important guy, big, big guy. And I have the television screen on and there’s rockets coming down. It was pure, beautiful white when it left, but it’s burned from the fire and the flame. And it is… And now I see it coming down like this and it’s like 20 stories tall or something. It is massive. And it is coming down. I say to the guy, “Hey, do me a favor. Will you hold on a minute? Just hold on. I’ll talk to you…”
(05:21:56)
This is one of the most important people. I’m watching. I said, “Just hold on.” I put the phone down. By the way, I never picked it up again. You know what these people are going to say? “He’s cognitively impaired. He’s cognitively impaired.” Oh, oh, you don’t think so? They’re the worst. They are the worst. So I put it down and I’m watching this rocket and I see the engines. I say, “Oh, it’s going to crash.” It was looking right next to gantry. I guess they called it the gantry, whatever the hell they call it. The launching pad. And it’s coming down at a bad angle. Elon, I wasn’t happy. And I was a little worried. You might’ve been worried too. I said, “Oh no, it’s not going to be good.”
(05:22:36)
And then all of a sudden I saw the flame on the bottom left and it was ripping… The flame was pouring out of that sucker and it straightened it out like this. And it came down and it landed. And then two of these big beautiful arms grabbed it and they held it tight. I wasn’t sure if it was a movie. I thought it might be one of these crazy movies. And I said, “I got to call Elon.” And I called him. I said, “Elon, was that you?” This is like about four minutes after. “Was that you?” “Yep, that was me.” I say, “Elon, you’re a genius. You are a genius. You are.” He is special. He is special. And you know what he wants more than anything else? For our country to be really well run, solidly run, to be run democratically, all the things that everybody in this room wants. I mean, honestly, he left that pad and he went to Pennsylvania to campaign. Can you believe it?
(05:23:51)
And I asked him a couple of questions. I said, “Elon, let me ask you a question. Can Russia do that?” “No.” “Can China do that?” “No.” “Can anybody do that other than you?” “Nobody else can do it. Nobody else can do it.” Pretty good. And he said, “And they won’t be able to for 10 years,” you said, right? They won’t be able to for 10 years. Now, he’s amazing. And he’s a great guy too. He really is. Got to remember him. This is a piece of work. We had a black hat, right? You saw him with a black hat at Butler. He was there and it was beautiful. We had 101,000 people celebrating a great firefighter, a great guy, Corey. And Elon got up… And I didn’t even know we made a black hat. I’d never seen anybody wear it. I’d seen the red hats all over the place, the white hats. I see all different… But I never saw black.
(05:24:53)
But he liked the black. He’s a little different. It’s a black hat with black letters. It’s called understated. And I said, “You like that hat?” He said, “I love that hat.” “I call it Dark MAGA.” But you know that after that evening, that became our number one best-selling hat, that one. All I have to do is put something on him. No, you are great. And thank you very much. Thank you very much. It’s great. Thank you. And we also have somebody that is great. And look, we’re not going to let him go too crazy, Elon, with the oil and gas stuff because Robert F. Kennedy cares more about human beings and health and the environment than anybody, and he’s going to be absolute… Having him is such a great honor.
(05:25:47)
I’ve been friends of his for a long time, and I’m going to let him go wild on health. I’m going to let him go wild on the food. I’m going to let him go wild on medicines. The only thing I don’t think I’m going to let him even get near is the liquid gold that we have under our feet. I don’t know, Elon. He might not like liquid gold. It’s oil and gas, sometimes referred to as oil and gas. JD, I think we’re going to have to keep him away from the oil and gas. What do you think? Howard, yes? But where is Robert? He’s around. He gave a beautiful speech. He’s a great guy. He truly cares… I mean, he truly cares about this and it’s an honor.
(05:26:27)
And we’re also pleased to be joined by my beautiful wife. She’s got the number one bestselling book in the whole universe, New York Times number one best-selling. Go out and buy one of them. It’s a great book. It’s a great… You know what? I was nervous when I read it. I said, “I wonder if she said some bad stuff about me.” I was very nervous. But she’s great. Congratulations, honey. That’s a big deal. Number one in the New York Times list. Now if she’s number one and her name is Trump on the New York Times list, that book definitely was number one, I guarantee you that. Thank you, honey. Great.
(05:27:12)
And we have a fabulous, brilliant woman. Top, top student. Top student at Yale Law School. They were both top students. They’re going to have very smart kids if you believe in that. I believe in it strongly. I would like to have their children because they are going to be smart. Yale Law School, top of the class, both of them. Usha Vance. Thank you, Usha, for being here. Thank you. Thank you very much, with their two beautiful children and my children here, Don and Eric and Tiffany, along with Lara, Kimberly, and Michael. We have great people. We have Baron at home. He’s watching. That Baron is watching. He’s the king of the internet. He’s the king of the internet. Oh, who was that?
(05:28:07)
That’s very nice. My sister Elizabeth is here. She’s great. I don’t know where she is, but she’s great and we love her. And speaker, Mike Johnson, is here and he’s doing a great job. It’s not easy when you have a majority of three, but he’s done a great job and he’s going to continue to do a great job and we like him. He is a terrific person. I watched him just totally decapitate a fake reporter on NBC. Meet the press, meet the fake press. What he did to her was… I think probably she’ll never be the same. Nobody would… Look at him, such a nice looking guy. Just that little beautiful face with the glasses. Got the little glasses. Everyone says, “Oh, he’s so nice. He’s such a nice person.” He’s not a nice person. He’s not nice at all, right, Matt? But great job. We think he’s great and he’s going to be around for a long time, I predict.
(05:29:07)
We have a senator here who I love, Senator Tommy Tuberville. And he is from a great place, Alabama. I love Alabama. I’m up in Alabama by 49 points, 49 points. We’re up by a lot in a lot of different places but it’s a great place. And thank you, Tommy, and all of our other great Congressmen. We have so many. If I ever named them, we’re going to be up here a long time. They’re going to angry. They won’t speak to me for probably a month or so, but it’ll calm down after that, right, Matt Gaetz? It’ll calm down. It’ll calm down. But we have great, great people and they’re really doing a job. And we’re going to turn this country around. With me, we got to get the Congressmen elected and we got to get the Senators elected because we can take the Senate pretty easily.

Donald Trump (05:30:00):

And I think with our little secret, we’re going to do really well with the House, right? Our little secret is having a big impact. He and I have a secret. We’ll tell you what it is when the race is over. I also want to thank Jim Dolan and everyone at Madison Square Garden for an unbelievable… This is unbelievable. I’ve watched the Knicks and Rangers here, and what a location. They tried to talk Jim out of this location, ” We’re going to move you to the river. We’re going to move you all over the place.” And he’s tough. He said, “I don’t know.” They offered him all sorts of money. “We’re going to move… It’s a very prime location. We’re going to move it to the river.” Well, we’re right on top of every train hub in the… It’s like the world or something right here. And he didn’t like it that much, but he was offered a lot. Man, did he make a good decision. That would’ve been peanuts compared to the value. But there’s no place like Madison Square Garden. Thank you very much to Jim and all of your people.
(05:31:06)
But here are the facts, Kamala Harris is a radical left Marxist rated even worse than crazy Bernie Sanders or Pocahontas. She destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of defund the police. Can you believe it? She was one of the originals for defund the police. And anybody who wants to defund our great police for even one week is not worthy of being President of the United States. Because that’s where her thinking is. Kamala vowed to abolish ICE. You know those tough people you’ve been looking up at the screen? They’re the ones that get them out of our country. I know a lot of people right in these rows, they’re very tough. They don’t want any part of it. They got to go in there [inaudible 05:31:54] to move them.
(05:31:56)
We had a case in Long Island where MS-13, one of the other really bad gangs, killed two young girls, 16 years old, walking to school. They didn’t shoot them. They knifed them and they cut them into little pieces because it was so painful. Perfect, perfect, young, beautiful girls were cut up into little pieces by knives. MS-13, they’re animals. And you know who took care of it for us? ICE. ICE, they had no problem. Kamala wants to defund ICE. We’re not defunding ICE, right? We’re not defunding ICE. We’re not even going to think about it. She’s never going to get the chance. There’s no way she becomes president. There’s no way. Radical left lunatic who destroyed… She destroyed San Francisco. She destroyed, along with Gavin Newscum, the governor who’s the worst, one of the worst governors in the country. They destroyed California and she’s not going to get a chance to destroy our country any further. We’re going to get it back fast.
(05:33:08)
She wants to ban fracking. And as California Attorney General, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon, and rape of an unconscious person as a totally nonviolent crime. She pledged to confiscate your guns. Is there anybody in the room that would like to give up their gun to…

Audience (05:33:33):

No.

Donald Trump (05:33:37):

I had a feeling you might say that. And endorsed a total ban on handgun ownership. I don’t think that’s good. When a criminal crawls into your house at night, it would be nice to be able to at least have a chance, wouldn’t it? Wouldn’t it be… She even called for free sex change operations on illegal aliens in detention at taxpayer expense. Think of it. At taxpayer…
(05:34:07)
She said they’re caught, they’re illegally detained, but if they want a sex change operation, she’s all in favor. Now, she gave this stuff up about a year ago, a little more, because it didn’t work. It wasn’t working too well with the electorate, but she’ll be back to it because that’s where… She’s a radical left person from San Francisco. She destroyed the place. But she lied about that, but she also lied about something very important. For years and years, she said she had a job at McDonald’s.
(05:34:41)
And the reason I went there last week… Do you know that I got a call from Sundar, very smart guy at Google. He said, “This is the most amazing thing. We’ve had just about more hits on this crazy McDonald’s story.” And I went there just to prove a little point. So you never know how something’s going to work out. Mr. VP, do you? But he called and he said, “We’ve had more hits on McDonald than…” I think he said anything we’ve ever had, but let’s say it’s close. And did anybody watch Joe Rogan recently? So she lied about McDonald’s, she lied about everything. She’s got ads on saying Donald Trump is this, he’s going to do this, he’s going to do… It’s the exact opposite what my policies are. She’s got me doing this. “He doesn’t want to frack. No, no, I’m all for fracking. And I have been for…” One thing I have been even the enemy because they are the enemy. What they’ve said, even that enemy too. And they’re really the enemy. They’re the enemy of the people, the press.
(05:35:48)
They said one thing about me that I consider a great compliment. They said, “This guy is the most consistent person we’ve ever seen.” Because I’ve been against cars and car factories being taken out of Detroit and being taken out of our manufacturing of automobiles, being taken out of our system, out of our country for years. I’ve been against all of the things that are happening and have happened. We stopped it and now it’s happened again when you hear 50,000 manufacturing jobs lost in just a short period of time. But I’ve been the most consistent because we’re going to bring our manufacturing back to the United States. It’s all coming back. So get ready. Get ready. You’re going to have your choice of great jobs.
(05:36:33)
And on top of all this, Kamala tried to turn our military woke. So tonight, whether you are a Republican Democrat or independent, conservative or liberal, I’m inviting you to join the greatest political movement in the history of our country. It’s really [inaudible 05:36:51]. It’s the greatest movement in the history of our country. I tell the story, years ago, there’s a guy, great guy, older guy now, very old, but he was great. Conservative guy. Pat Buchanan, right? We know Pat Buchanan. He came in second in the New Hampshire primary. And for 45 years, he made an unbelievable career of it. He was a hot item. He was on every show. I came in second in one primary. We came in first in 50 primaries. We then had a great election that we won, we then had another great election that we did a hell of a lot better in and bad things happen. We’re not going to let that happen. COVID. They used COVID to cheat. But we then had an election.
(05:37:42)
But now, we have the election of, oh, this will be, in my opinion… I have to say if, because there’s always risks, I guess. But if we pull this off, this will be the biggest political event in the history of our country. Right? And we’re building the biggest, broadest, most diverse coalition in American history, including union workers and Border Patrol agents. By the way, the Border Patrol gave me last week their complete and total endorsement. They said, “He’s the greatest president in the history of the country.” But we don’t have to go that far. And they said, “There’s never been anybody like him on the border.” They said to him, the fake news said, “Has she ever called you?” “No.” They didn’t like that answer, by the way.
(05:38:38)
Then they asked her, “Have you ever called?” “No, she never called.” Almost four years, she never called, not once, the Border Patrol. And she was the border czar. She was in charge of the border. Think of it, four years she’d never called. Now, she’s trying to say, “Well, I was really not the border…” Whether she was the border czar or not, she was put in charge of the border by Sleepy Joe. And then he went to bed, he put her in charge, went to bed. She did the worst job on the border than anybody has done in the history of the world. There’s never been a border like this in the world. And a third-world country would fight people with sticks and stones to stop them from pouring into their country. And we let them just come right in. What a shame. What a shame.
(05:39:27)
Police and firefighters also. We have every endorsement from virtually every sheriff’s department, police department. I don’t think they have one cop. They’re looking for just one cop. Is there one? Well, it’s not going to be a New York’s finest. By the way, how good are the police outside? New York’s finest. And I want to thank Mayor Adams because Mayor Adams has been treated pretty badly. When he said that this whole thing with the migrants coming into New York, “This is just not sustainable. We can’t do it. We’re trying to run a city. We got 100,000 migrants covered. We can’t do it. It just can’t do it. It’s not feasible. It’s not good.” He said it very nicely. I said, “Well, he’s going to be indicted by these lunatics [inaudible 05:40:25].” A year later, he got indicted. I think they upgraded his seat in an airplane. [inaudible 05:40:34] this is a very serious charge. They’ve upgraded my seat a lot too. I used to fly commercial. I don’t fly it so much anymore, but they’d see me back there and, “Sir, would you like an upgrade?” I don’t know. Maybe it’s something else. But I have to tell you, he’s been really great. And he said that they shouldn’t be calling Trump a dictator because it’s not true. That’s nice. That was nice. Very nice. So we want to thank Mayor Adams, going through a hard time with these people. These are lunatics, by the way. They’ve weaponized the Justice Department against their political opponent. I am under investigation more than the great late Alphonse Capone.
(05:41:18)
My father’s looking down on me right now. He was a tough guy but he was legit. And I know my mother’s in heaven. I’m not 100% sure my father, but it’s close. But he’s looking down at me right now and he’s saying, “How the hell did this happen to my son? He’s not a bad person.” I’m a good person. All we want to do is straighten out our country. But all of the veterans are with us, all of the steel workers. I saved our steel. I saved our steel plants. And I don’t like Japan buying U.S. Steel. U.S. Steel used to be like Elon Musk 70 years ago. The biggest, the best company in the world. You know that, Elon? You wouldn’t know. He’s too young to know. U.S. Steel was the big baby. That was a big… I don’t know, there’s something nice about U.S. Steel being the biggest as opposed to Google. It’s like a different kind of a company.
(05:42:15)
But we sort of need steel in this country. Like we’re not going to go to war with me as your president, but if we… On the long shot that we do, we don’t want to say, “We need steel. Can we get it from China or can we get it from someplace else?” It’s always a possibility. But I will tell you, you’re not going to have a war with me and you’re not going to have a Third World War with me. That, I can tell you. But we need steel. And I would not approve U.S. Steel being bought by Japan. I wouldn’t do it, just out of… Psychologically not good. We’ll help them out, but I don’t like it. We’re seeing historic levels of support among our Black population, Hispanic population, and our Asian population. Jews, Muslims.
(05:42:59)
By the way, did anybody see yesterday? Did anybody see what took place? I was with the Muslims yesterday in Michigan. And when the polls first came out, they had 100%, I had 0. And yesterday, I watched this anchor on CNN almost choke. She said, “Something’s happening in Michigan. Big population, couple of hundred thousand, a lot of votes. Something is happening. The poll just came out. Trump is at 59, Kamala is at 8 with the Muslim population.” They never saw anything like that [inaudible 05:43:42]. And these are people, by the way, they’re great. They just want peace. They want to have peace and it’s great.
(05:43:49)
So Jews and Muslims and Catholics and Evangelicals and Mormons, and they’re all joining our cause in large numbers, larger than anyone has ever seen in this country before, larger than they’ve ever seen in any country. And the Republican Party has really become the party of inclusion. And that’s something very nice about that. And we’re a big powerful party. And they’re losing it. They’re really losing it. Together, we will lift America to glory beyond your wildest dreams. It’s going to happen fast too.
(05:44:25)
So in conclusion, with your vote this November, we are going to fire Kamala and we are going to save America. We will cut your taxes, end inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages, and bring thousands and thousands of factories back to America. We’re even going to get Elon to bring that stuff back. We will build American, we will buy American, and we will hire American. I will end the war in Ukraine, which would’ve never happened if I were president. I will stop the chaos in the Middle East and I will prevent World War III from happening. We will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources, and respect that they so dearly deserve. We will strengthen and modernize our military. I rebuilt our military in total. We built all of our military. Built 571 miles of wall too. I took it out of the military because I couldn’t get it from the people in Congress that should’ve given it to us. So I considered it an invasion.
(05:45:39)
I said to a couple of generals, I said, “Congratulations. This is an invasion of our country.” So I took it out of the military. Had nine lawsuits and won them all. We will build a massive defense shield all made in the USA. We’re going to build a beautiful dome over our country. And a lot of it’s going to be made right here in New York. We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington, D.C., which has become a very dangerous and badly managed place. We’re going to make them safe, clean, and beautiful again. We will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag.
(05:46:28)
And as long as the Speaker of the House of Representatives is here, I would like to put forward a bill, because I watched two months ago as some very bad people, radical left people, by the way, nothing happened to them, in Washington, D.C., burned our American flags. They were burning flags. And I would like to suggest that we put in a bill. If you burn the American flag, one year in jail. We will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools. And we will keep men out of women’s sports. I will defend religious liberty. I will restore free speech and I will defend the right to keep and bear arms. Our Second Amendment is under siege. After years of building up foreign nations, defending foreign borders, and protecting foreign lands, we are finally going to build up our country, defend our borders, and protect our citizens. It’s called America First. And it’s going to happen at levels never seen before. And I’ll tell our friends, our allies, who sometimes treat us very badly, that it’s about time we take care of ourselves. And we will stop the illegal immigration that’s taking place at levels never seen before. We will stop it cold and once and for all. We will not be invaded. We will not be occupied. We will not be overrun. We will not be conquered. We will be a free and proud nation once again.
(05:48:26)
Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. And very much so it will be filled with the American dream. We’re bringing back the American dream and we’re going to bring it back at the highest level that you’ve ever seen. But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda with a landslide that is too big to rig. So you need to get out and vote. Get your husband off the couch. The football game doesn’t mean a damn thing. You got to get out and vote. Get up, Harry. Come on, Harry. Get up, Harry. Let’s go. You’re going to vote for the president, Harry. We’re going to save our country. For the past nine years, we have been fighting against the most sinister and corrupt forces on Earth. With your vote in this election, you can show them once and for all that this nation does not belong to them. This nation belongs to you. It belongs to you.
(05:49:33)
No city embodies the spirit energy and potential of the American people more than where we are gathered tonight. We want to win our country, but we also want to win New York and make it safe and strong and beautiful and affordable and vibrant again. And we’re going to do that. And we’ll work with the mayor and we’ll work with the governor. We’re going to do that. We’re going to make it great. When I left for Washington eight years ago, we had a horrible mayor named de Blasio, who’s a horrible, horrible. And things you could see, they weren’t being properly done, but still, it was a place that people wanted to be and all. But since then, our federal government, what they’ve done to this place, what they’ve done to the state, and I mean, to force hundreds of thousands of really rough people into this beautiful, I call it a beautiful oasis.
(05:50:36)
When I left New York, was the place you wanted to be. And now, people just don’t speak well of it. But we’re going to bring it back and we’re going to bring it back strong. And I hope you go out and vote. You got to vote for… You got to vote. It would be such an honor to win New York. Hasn’t been done in decades, hasn’t been done in so long. It hasn’t been done in so long. They all say, “Sir, you’re wasting your money.” I don’t think so. Your crime is through the roof. Everything is through the roof. I remember during debate they said, “No, sir.” This stupid person named David Muir from ABC fake news. He said, “Sir, crime is not through the roof. Crime is down.” I said, “No, it’s not.” I said, “It’s not down. It’s up.” “It’s down.” I was debating three people. I had him, I had that person next to him who I never even heard of.
(05:51:31)
But it turned out the following day, they released the stats and crime was up 45%. And what a shame. What a shame. We really need a fair press in this country. If we have a fair press, that’s going to be 50% of the battle of bringing it back. But this is the city where I was born and raised, and this is the town that taught me that Americans can do anything when they want to. So no matter our differences, when we work together, there is nothing that we cannot achieve. From New York to Las Vegas, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Charlotte, from Atlanta to Detroit, this nation was built by generations of American patriots who gave everything they had for our rights, our future, and for our freedom. Through freezing cold winters and hot scorching summers, through storms and setbacks and conflicts and danger, our American ancestors pushed onward, marched forward, and overcame every single obstacle that stood in their way.
(05:52:42)
Together, they crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up those mighty skyscrapers, built the highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and launched American astronauts to the moon. It was hardworking patriots like you who built this country. And nine days from now, it’s hardworking patriots like you who are going to save our country. After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of the USA. With your help from now until election day, we will restore America’s promise. We will put America first, and we will take back the nation that we all love.
(05:53:45)
We bleed the same blood, we share the same home, and we salute the same great American flag. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. We will never give in, we will never give up. We will never, ever back down. And we will never, ever, ever, ever surrender. Together, we will fight, fight, fight, and we will win, win, win. We’re going to win, win, win. November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country. And together, we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, New York. God bless you. God bless you all. Thank you.

Thank you very much, everybody. Oh, this is a nice crowd. Thank you.
(00:39)
Well, a very, very special hello to Greensboro. Hello Greensboro. And another hello to North Carolina, because I’ve been at North Carolina a lot lately, you probably see. I followed that horrible storm and then I came back and we spent a lot of time here yesterday. I met some incredible people. What they’ve done is unbelievable. They haven’t had much help from our government in Washington, I can tell you that. But come January 20th when you take office you’re going to be seeing a lot of me. We’re going to fix it up and make it better than ever. And I’m thrilled to be back in this incredible state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. And that’s what you are.
(01:31)
And I’d like to begin by asking a question. Are you better off now than you were four years ago? I don’t think so. I don’t think so. So I’m here today with a message of hope for all Americans. With your vote this election I will end inflation. I will stop the invasion of criminals into our country. And I will bring back, as your president, the American dream. We’re going to bring it back. Our country is being crippled and destroyed by Kamala Harris, but it does not have to be this way. It won’t be this way for long, hopefully what we’ve put up with, with the two of them. What we put up with the two of them with your support on November 5th, America will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer and stronger than ever before. This election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of incompetence, failure and disaster, or whether we’ll begin the four greatest years in the history of our country. We’ll do something that nobody will even believe. After all of the catastrophes that she has caused. Kamala, Kamala, ayayay. She can’t say one thing. Not one thing did she’d do differently. They said, “Would you do anything differently?” “Well, I can’t really think of anything.” She’s terrible. We need smart people. Now it’s time for smart people. Not time for these people.
(03:18)
So I’m asking you to be excited about the future of our country again. And this will be America’s new Golden Age. We’re going to turn it around so fast your head will spin. Going to stop all of this craziness. Every problem facing us can be solved. But now the fate of our nation is in your hands in North Carolina. You have to stand up and you have to tell Kamala Harris that you’ve had enough. You can’t take it anymore. We’re not going to take it anymore. You’re the worst vice president in the history of our country. And you’re aligned with the worst president in the history of our country, who by the way likes me more than he likes her. But I won’t say that. Kamala, you’re fired. Get out, Kamala. Get out. Get out.
(04:12)
No, I think she probably does. I think he likes me slightly more. He hates me. But when you think of what happened to him, think about it. He was doing okay and then he had sort of a bad debate and his numbers went down a little bit. And that’s to be expected. And then they went to him and they really just took the presidency away from him. And he’s got a lot of anger in his heart. He’s got a lot of hatred in his heart. And much of it goes to her, because she was the first one out. She failed. 22 people who going for the Democrat nomination and she was the first one. Think of it, she was the first one out and now they’re a threat to democracy as they like to say. “They’re a threat to democracy.” But nobody would’ve thought that was possible.
(05:05)
And now she’s cratering in the polls. You see it, because they’re learning who she is. She’s a radical left lunatic. Yesterday I was here in North Carolina, outside Asheville where I witnessed the terrible devastation of Hurricane Helene. To every family who was lost a loved one or a home or they lost so much. Our hearts are with you and we are praying for you. The polls are open for early voting in North Carolina. And every day from now until November 2nd. And then on November 5th, oh. If you think about it, that has a chance to be the biggest day in American history. That could be a very exciting day. It’s going to be the most important election in American history. I really believe it, because our country has lost its way. We are a failing nation. I don’t like saying that, but we are indeed a failing nation. What a nice crowd this is. Well, a lot of people. No, we don’t like saying it, but it’s…
(06:18)
Thank you. Great.
(06:18)
What people, people. We are going to take care of you. We’re going to work together. We won twice here and we won twice everywhere, if you want to really know. We won twice everywhere. Too big to rig. We got to make it too big to rig. Everybody get out. But we’re going to make it too big to rig. But if you’re displaced due to the storm, you do not have to return to your home county to vote. You can request a ballot to your temporary housing location and go to trumpvote2024.com/nc for more details.
(07:12)
You know what the amazing thing in the fake news is picking up? That’s a lot of fake news tonight. That’s a lot. And up there I would say you have about 9% of decent people. It’s like about 9%. It’s unbelievable. Boy, it would be nice. You know what? If we had an honest press, a press that wrote the truth, we would be so much further along as a country. But that’s a big group back there. You know where Kamala is today? They don’t want to tell you. She’s… No, no, no. You don’t know where she is. You know where she is. She’s sleeping. She took a day off. She’s got no energy at all. Her speeches last for about 15 minutes. Peter knows that by Peter. Her speeches last for about 15, 20 minutes. He’s out of there.
(08:19)
So think of this, we have 14 days to the most important election in the history of our country. It’s actually only important for us. It’s important. For them I don’t think it’s that important. I really don’t think it’s that important. But you know what she did? She took a day off. How do you take a day off? 14 days, you don’t take days off, right? I’ve gone 52 days now I got 14 more. We don’t take days off. We got to win this thing. If we don’t win it, our country’s in big trouble. Our country’s in big trouble. No, I heard it today and she’s taking another day off tomorrow, they say. What the hell? Maybe she knows something that we don’t know. Do you think she knows some kind of result that we don’t know about? Maybe. Maybe she knows something. I doubt it. No, she’s bad news.
(09:17)
With your help 14 days from now we’re going to win North Carolina. We’re going to defeat Kamala Harris. And we’re going to make America great again. We’re going to make it so great, right? This state was once the beating heart of American manufacturing. You know that. You know what happened. But year after year, globalist after globalist, radical left politician after radical left politician. Kamala Harris and her party sold you out, allowed your jobs to be plundered and stolen from you by other countries. After NAFTA and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization some of the worst things that ever happened to this country, North Carolina lost over 300,000 manufacturing jobs like taking candy from a baby. Including 60% of its furniture manufacturing jobs. I used to come here to buy furniture. I’d come here. The artists you had that were artisans that were incredible. I’d like to see a new handle on the chair. And you’d have a guy, “Oh, yes sir, ding, ding, ding, ding.” I mean the most incredible talent. But stupid politicians took that away from you. Really stupid, horrible politicians.
(10:42)
They took it away. They took it away. It went to China and lots of other places. And you heard when I bought some furniture, the chairs would break. People would sit in the chairs, they’d break. I end up getting sued all the time. I like North Carolina much better, if that’s okay. Under Kamala, the United States lost 50,000 manufacturing jobs just this year alone. I don’t even mention Biden anymore. I don’t know what the hell’s going on there. Who do you tell? Who’s running this place? We’re close to a nuclear war and we don’t know who the hell’s running our country. Is it him? He goes, “Obama’s, running it.” Obama. That’s another beauty, Obama. He did great, didn’t he? he Did great. If you like a divided country, he was a great… He was fabulous, Obama. He was a real beauty. But under the Trump administration we’re going to take back what’s ours. We’re going to take it back. We’re going to bring it all back. We’re going to end the looting, ransacking, raping, and pillaging of North Carolina in our whole country, because you’re one state. But this has happened to many states. Look at what’s happened in Michigan with the automobiles. I mean, they were the capital of the world for automobiles. Now they’re really just hanging by a thread. And because of me, I just stopped the largest plant anywhere in the world being built in Mexico, owned by China. They were going to make cars.
(12:20)
And they were going to… You know this story. A year ago they announced, “Largest plant in the world.” They were going to make cars, sell them into the United States and destroy Detroit, Michigan and all of Michigan. They were going to make more cars in that one plant than all of Michigan makes as a whole. And I said, “You’re not going to do it.” And I said, “You know what? I’m going to run for president and I’m going to put tariffs on that damn plant. And you’re not going to do it.” And I just heard last week they’ve abandoned the plant, because of Trump. Because they think we’re going to get elected. And they say, “If Trump gets elected, we’re going to lose our ass. And we’re not going to do it.” So they decided they’re not going to build the plant.
(13:05)
But you know what? If she gets in, they’ll start the plant like your head will spin. And they’ll be selling hundreds of thousands, millions of cars into our country with that big monstrous plant. There are a number of plants. They’re all stopped. Every one of them. Because they think I’m going to come in impose 100, maybe 200 or do whatever’s necessary. They’re not going to have one car come into our country and destroy Michigan and South Carolina and Tennessee and a little bit of North Carolina. But South Carolina has been very big with that. But we’re not going to let them destroy our country, our states that do the auto things. You do a little bit of it and sometimes a lot depending on your mood.
(13:49)
You have a lot of things in the state. You cover a lot of territory. Peter, they cover a lot of territory in this state. But the one that I liked best, I loved, and I really mean it, I loved what you did for furniture. Isn’t that terrible? I had such a heart for furniture here. It’s hard to come back. It’s hard to come back. But we’re going to bring it back. We’re going to bring all of it back. More than you ever had before. We’re going to bring it all back. We’re going to bring it all back. I’ll tell you what, if she becomes president of this country, this country is finished. This country is finished. And I don’t like to be that way. And I wasn’t that way even with Crooked Hillary. I wasn’t talking that way. This woman is a radical left lunatic who has no right even running. She doesn’t deserve to be able to run. She came in last in the primary. Now she’s running, because they want to be politically correct. I’m not going to let this happen.
(14:53)
Starting in January, we will give our companies the lowest taxes, the lowest energy cost, the lowest regulatory burdens, and free access to the best and biggest market in the planet. But if we keep going like this, we’re not going to have the best market anymore. We’re going to be like Venezuela on steroids, okay. That’s what we’re going to be. And I used to say that. And if I don’t get elected, that’s what’s going to happen. You’re going to end up in a 1929 style depression. If you look at what her policies are, she has no idea about business, she has no idea… Frankly, she has no idea about anything. She destroyed San Francisco, which was really the best city, I think maybe the best city in the country. She destroyed it. She helped destroy California along with Gavin Newsom, who was one of the worst governors in the history of our country. But only if they make their products here, they’re going to get these benefits. Only if they make their products here in America. And they hire American workers to do the job. It’s very simple. And if these companies don’t make their products here, then they will pay a quite stiff tariff. Nice tariff. We’re taking a lot. You know how much China paid us during my time? Hundreds of billions of dollars. No other president got them to pay not 10 cents. Go through all these great presidents. Oh, they were so great. Not 10 cents. China didn’t pay 10 cents. And they were ripping us left and right. That’s why I got into politics, if you want to call it that. I don’t feel I’m a politician, but what the hell? Call me whatever you want. But it really was trade. And you know what? It morphed from trade. And now I say most important thing to me, trade. Always trade with me. We’re going to bring jobs back like nobody’s ever seen. But the border, it’s so horrible what they’re doing to us on the border. To me, if you look at the polls, it’s the economy and it’s inflation, and then it’s the border. I think the border is the biggest.
(17:12)
Thank you.
(17:17)
So I think the border has become… To me, it’s the worst thing I’ve ever seen where we’re allowing criminals to come in. Hundreds of thousands of criminals to pour into our country. They come from jails, they come from places unknown, from countries we’ve never even heard of. 181 countries were represented as of last night. Think of it, 180. To me, number one is our border. We don’t want murderers. We don’t want people from mental institutions coming in. We don’t want people coming in who are terrorists. And I think it’s number one. And then number two would be economy. And number three is inflation. Or you could put them together, do it any way you want. But I think that the border is the biggest threat to this country, other than of course some horrible, horrible radical left lunatic politicians that we have. That’s a pretty big threat to our country also.
(18:15)
But I will never apologize for defending America. I will protect our workers. I will protect our jobs. I will protect our borders. I will protect our families. And I will protect the birthright of our children to live in the richest and most powerful nation on the face of the earth. And we’ll have it back there very soon. We’re going to have it back there very soon. With four more years of Kamala Harris, North Carolina will be an economic wasteland. That’s what’s going to happen. The rest of your companies are going to move out. Everybody knows that. The smart people know she’s the only one that doesn’t know it. Low IQ. She’s a low IQ individual. And we’ve had that for four years. We don’t need another four. No country could take that. Can you imagine what President Xi… I got to know him very well. He’s a fierce individual. The press, the fake news hates when I say that he’s a brilliant man. He runs 1.4 billion people with an iron fist. If I say he’s a brilliant man, they say, “He called him a…” Okay, he’s not a smart man at all. These people are crazy back there, I’m telling you. Am I allowed to say he’s smart? Is he smart? He’s a smart man. He’s a fierce man. I got along with him very well. Putin. These are people that are tough people. Kim Jong-un, North Korea. Nuclear weapons all over the place. I said, “You ever do anything else? Go to a game? Do something?” He loves producing nuclear weapons. That’s what he likes producing. And he’s got a lot of them. And he has no respect for our leadership now.
(19:56)
And he doesn’t respect… He didn’t respect Obama. He thought Obama was a real jerk. A real jerk. And I think he’s a real jerk, because I’ve watched him campaign over the last couple of days. I watched him campaign. What a divider he is, right? What a divider he is. He divided this country. He couldn’t care less, him and his little group of people. He was terrible. But I’ve watched what he’s done. He’s trying to campaign, because she’s incapable of campaigning. So they send him in to try. He’s not going to do it. You know who he helped? He helped Hillary Clinton. How did that work out? He came out for Hillary. So they sent out the same thing. But the fake news, they don’t talk about that. They said, “Oh, they’re bringing out Barack Hussein Obama.” Oh, Barack remember Rush. Barack Hussein Obama. Rush Limbaugh. We miss him, don’t we? Don’t we miss him, Peter. They’re bringing out Obama. I say, “Oh, they did that with Hillary. Clinton. Good, I’m glad they’re bringing him out.” The reason they’re bringing him out, he doesn’t even want to do it.
(21:15)
I think he’s exhausted. I watched him talking. I think the guy’s exhausted. And I never say a guy’s looking old, but he’s looking a little bit older, isn’t he? There’s nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong. But he’s exhausted. He’s exhausted. But the reason they bring him out, and other people, they’re bringing out all these other people. Nobody goes to their rallies. Nobody goes there. So you know what they do? They bring in so-called stars. Stars that I’ve never even heard of. These are not stars to me. These are not stars to me. But they bring out some people. And what happens is the star comes in, they get a little bit of a crowd. They don’t get crowds like this. And they have guitars, I don’t, okay. I got nothing up here. And they bring him out and they get an audience. They perform for a couple of minutes. And then they leave. And then the candidate gets up. There’s nobody in the room. They got to do it the other way around. Let her speak first.
(22:12)
But they bring him out because they need help, because she cannot talk for more than 15 minutes. And when the teleprompter goes out. Remember 32, 32, 32 days. I said, “What the hell is going on with her?” I was watching. You always want to watch your opponent, right? I was watching her and she started doing that 32. She was just about gone. And then that sucker snapped back on. It’s a dangerous business. If you’re a teleprompter reader it could be dangerous, because no matter how good these guys… I have a great guy, but about 5% of the time you lose a teleprompter.
(23:11)
Sometimes it breaks down and snaps. We call it a snap back. It’s gone. And now you’re on your way and then you go ping and it’s back. But no matter how good they are, you lose it 5% of the time. And I thought she lost it. And I just wanted to see a little bit longer. I just wanted to see, because she was over. But if you’d like to go into politics, you got to be able to make a speech without reading a teleprompter. Because if you need a teleprompter like her, you’re in trouble.
(23:46)
We got two of them, Biden and her. How about Biden? She’d make his, “Hello.” And then he could never find… I don’t want to hit him too hard anymore though, because you know? I really want to keep it this way where he likes me better than her, because I think it’s. No, but think of it. They stole the presidency of the United States. They took it. I don’t want to use the word coup. Nobody knows what the hell that means. It was a coup, but nobody knows. Here’s simpler, they stole the presidency. They walked in, they said, “You’re getting out.” I mean, he didn’t have to do that. And then they say, “He was so brave in getting out. He was so brave. It was such a wonderful that he got out. He’s a great American hero.” They threw him out. They took him out.
(24:36)
Crazy Nancy Pelosi, she’s crazy as… She did a nut job, by the way. And Schumer, I was with Schumer the other night at the big Catholic dinner. How did I do with that dinner? The Al Smith dinner, big dinner. 77 years almost without fail every candidate goes to that out of respect to Catholics. And she said she’s not going. It never happens. It hadn’t happened in decades. And the last person… We know who that was. The last person lost let’s say he lost everything but one state. You know what state it was? Minnesota, the home of the worst, the stupidest man I’ve ever seen run for office. Is there something wrong with that guy? He’s always bouncing. He’s going with his heart. Yeah, I never got that. But there’s something wrong with that guy, I am telling you.
(25:46)
And you know, that should enter in… And I have somebody the exact opposite. A brilliant guy, J.D Vance, who’s really very solid, very solid. Kamala’s inflation has already cost the typical family over $30,000 on higher prices. And now she wants to raise the typical family’s taxes by nearly $3,000 a year. Take a look at this.

Video (26:16):

Kamala Harris is going to significantly raise taxes.

Kamala Harris (26:22):

Taxes are going to have to go up.

Video (26:23):

Kamala’s Plan will raise family’s taxes by nearly $2,600 a year. Under Kamala prices have already soared. Now, she’d make it worse with even higher taxes.

Kamala Harris (26:32):

Taxes are going to have to go up.

Video (26:34):

President Trump will cut taxes again, no taxes on tips overtime or social security. Our president Trump approved this message.

Donald Trump (26:51):

Thank you.
(26:51)
Remember when I said no taxes on tips? And then like a month later, she goes, “We will have no taxes on tips.” And the place was booing her. They said, “A little bit late.” Anyway, and you never heard it. I haven’t even heard her say it again after that, because that just shows you the kind of dedication they have to their statements. No, she’s the taxing queen. And she’s also demanding a shocking 33% tax hike in all domestic production along with the largest capital gains tax hike in history. This is going to be the largest tax anybody’s ever had to pay. And every business is going to leave our country and go to another country. They don’t have to stay here. They have a lot of opportunity. It used to be you’d go to a different state, now they go to a different country. They’ll go to Asia, they’ll go to Europe, they’ll go to different countries.
(27:40)
And you’ve had that. And all you’re doing is forcing them out and with them goes the jobs and the money. By contrast, I will massively cut taxes for workers and small businesses and do just as you saw, no tax on tips. No tax on overtime. And no tax on social security benefits. Here’s something that I think is going to be great. Think of this. And I just made a decision to do it a little bit differently, because I’m only going to do it if they build that particular product, namely an automobile, in the United States. Listen to this. I will make interest on car loans fully tax deductible, because affording a car is essential to restoring the American dream.
(28:23)
So I had calls from the biggest people in Wall Street, “Where did you come up with these ideas? The no tax on Tips. Who gave that to you?” Actually, it was a waitress at Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. I didn’t pay a consultant $5 million to come up with the idea. Waitress said, “It’s terrible the way they’re treating us with tips.” And a lot of them, I mean a lot of people don’t report those tips anyway, really? I guess it’s a weird kind of a thing. “How do you tax it?” Somebody puts $5 in their pocket. Let’s see. But she gave me the idea. But they said, “How did you come up with this thing on deductibility of interest on automobiles?”

Donald Trump (29:00):

… Automobiles. I said it was just an idea I had, but I had a better idea because here’s what I’m doing. I don’t want it to benefit other countries. I want it to benefit us, so its deductibility of interest is great, but only if the car is manufactured in the United States. Is that a great idea? Why the hell would we give them taxes if they manufacture the car in China, or Japan, or lots of other places that stole our business over the years? Mexico is a very big threat. I’m telling you, it’s a big threat. So, we’re doing that now and I think that’s going to be great for Detroit. And we’re leading in Michigan, by the way, by good margin because of the brilliant mandate that next week you’re going to be forced to drive all electric. Everybody’s going to have an electric car.
(30:16)
They don’t go far. They cost too much. And by the way, they’re great. You know what? They’re great. And Elon makes the best of them, as far as I’m concerned. And he’ll be the first to admit it’s a certain market and it’s a certain market for certain things, but you have to have gasoline powered. Here we have more gasoline, we have more oil and gas, we have more liquid gold than anybody in the world, and we’re trying to go all electric. So, we want that. We want hybrids. We don’t want hydrogen cars. We don’t want hydrogen. Would anybody like a hydrogen car? You know what a hydrogen car? It’s a great car. It’s a wonderful car, except if it happens to explode, then you are unrecognizable.
(31:04)
They said they have it down, they don’t think more than 10 or 20 will explode a year, but if it does, you’re gonzo. So, we told them, “Let’s not spend a lot of money on that.” That’s one of those things, no matter how good it is, you don’t want it. But other than that, they said it works quite well. On day one of the Trump administration, I will terminate Kamala’s insane electric vehicle mandate and we will end the Green New Scam once and for all. The Green New Scam, you know whose idea that was, right? AOC, young girl. Very nice person. She never even studied the environment in college. Average student at best. She was an average student.
(31:52)
She walked in one day, she said, “We’re going to all be dead in 12 years because the oceans are rising.” Well, it’s been more than 12 years. What’s going on? No, we have a much bigger threat. We have a threat called nuclear weapons and having stupid people running our country. And if you talk about global warming, that’s the real global warming, not this nonsense of the ocean’s going to rise over the next 400 years by one-eighth of an inch, and we’re going to be wiped out. No, we have a threat right now. We better get smart because we’re very close to World War III. If you take a look at what’s going on, we’re very close. So, we have a couple of different areas, but we’ll have more than that.
(32:32)
And you can look at the side, look at the teams. They’re already being divided up. You see what’s going on with Iran, and Russia, and China, and now other countries are adding into that group, North Korea. No, no, no. We have very stupid people letting this happen. That should have never happened. Now they want to attack our dollar. They want to take our dollar away from us. They want to take our dollar and not have that be the standard any longer. And that would be like losing a world war, then we would be indeed third world status. And if I’m elected, they’re not doing that. I guarantee you that. No chance.
(33:11)
Just like Russia would’ve never attacked Ukraine. Zero. By the way, even a Democrat congressman was on television, and many Democrats are saying that. And by the way, for four years, they didn’t. So, it’s not like, oh, gee, they won’t. For four years, they didn’t. I think what happened is when Putin saw how weak we were, how pathetic we were with the stupid Milley and these generals that aren’t even generals as far as I was concerned. What a stupid group of people they were. Mattis, Milley. You know the real ones, the ones that I used to defeat ISIS? We defeated ISIS. They were the real generals. They were the real generals. They weren’t the television generals. They weren’t the dumb ones. They were the ones that were warriors.
(33:55)
But we’ll quickly become energy independent and we will frack, frack, frack, and we will drill, baby, drill. We’re going to drill. And in 12 months from January 20, that’s the day we take office, I will cut your energy prices by 50, 50%, 50% within one year. And we can do it. No other country can say it. Very few countries can say it, but no other country can say that we have more liquid gold. We’re going to drill. Your prices are going to come down. Then everything else is going to start coming down, too, because you’re paying too much. You know what people tell me mostly? Groceries. A simple word, groceries. The overall effect of bacon, and lettuce, and all of this stuff is the biggest, the worst we’ve ever had. We’ve never had anything like it.
(34:48)
How about interest rates? Think of this: When I was president, interest was 2.2%. Now it’s 10% and you can’t get any money, so it’s much higher than 10%. And I have really good news, because I keep hearing people say, “2.50, 2.25 a gallon.” So the other day I’m looking at some things and some statistics. So, we had $1.84 a gallon. That was the real price that you had. $1.84 compared to now it’s about $4, but it was up to $5, and California was 7 and $8. We were at 1.84, and everybody was happy. It was nice to drive to Washington D.C. But the problem with Washington D.C., too dangerous. We’re going to clean that city up, but we’re going to make it greater. We’re going to make it safe so you can go down and you can see the Washington Monument.
(35:47)
You can go see honest Abe and you can see Thomas Jefferson. They wanted to rip that down. Remember, they wanted to rip down the Thomas Jefferson? And I said, “That’s not going to happen.” Remember I passed that law, the old law that was… They came into town, they wanted to rip down our statues. And I said, “Well, do they have a point?” A couple of them were a little rough. Then I said, “Well, now I heard they want to rip down honest Abe Lincoln.” Now you’re getting a little bit nasty. And I went out and we were tough. I said, “Give me that law. I want to sign it immediately.” We took it. It was an old law from early 1900s.
(36:28)
And it basically said that if you so much as look at or touch any monument anywhere in the country, federal monument anywhere in the country, you get immediately 10 years in jail with no early getting out stuff. And I signed it with a news conference. Remember I said, “Anybody that wants to play games with me, you can play games, but it’s not going to work out well.” And we had a lot of people in Washington, they were having a lot of fun thinking about which statue they’re going to take down. And as soon as I signed it, I watched the backs of those people, I don’t want to use the word asses. I watched the backs of those people leaving town. They all left town very nicely. We had no problem.
(37:12)
But just recently, a month ago, they were in Washington and they’re spray-painting beautiful limestone lions and doing tremendous damage, fighting with the police. And by the way, nothing happened to those people. When you spray paint over limestone, you’ll see it in 100 years from now because limestones are very poor. I was really good at real estate and building. Limestone’s very poor, as poor stone. And that stuff goes right into that. You can’t get it out unless you want to do it with a chisel and that’s not going to work. And you’re going to see that in 100 years from now… And it’s very, very sad. And nothing happened to those people. Nothing.
(37:50)
I watched it very closely, and they did great destruction and they had fistfights with our cops. They had fistfights. They were rolling on the grass and fighting our police. Nothing happened to them. Under Kamala’s economy, millions of Americans are suffering because of inflation. They’re losing their jobs. They can’t afford housing, groceries or a car, and yet Kamala is importing millions of illegals across our borders and giving them taxpayer benefits at your expense, while taking the jobs from African-Americans and from Hispanic Americans at levels that we have not seen. You’re going to see reports coming out very soon. They’re trying to hold it until after the election. Hopefully, it won’t matter because we’re going to win by so much.
(38:35)
But let them give you the reports of what’s happening to our African-American population, our Hispanic population. They are taking the jobs of our African-Americans and Hispanic Americans, and it’s tremendous numbers. And they’re going to release these numbers sometime after the election, and everyone’s going to be upset and nothing they could do. You’re going to have to wait four more years. And I’m not sure we can wait four more years, because I don’t know that we’ll have a country in four more years. So, you ought to start looking at that to the fake news media. Show them what’s happening to the Black population and to the Hispanic population, with these people that are coming into our country illegally.
(39:27)
You are witnessing the economic oppression of Americans to reward and enrich illegal aliens. They come into hotels, and they stay in hotels, in luxury hotels paid for by the government. And they walk past our veterans who are sleeping on the street right in front of that hotel. But all of that stops two weeks from tonight. It all stops. For four straight years, Kamala Harris has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from prisons and jails, from insane asylums and mental institutions all around the world, from Venezuela to the Congo, not just South America. This is all over the world.
(40:25)
We’re the dumping ground for the whole world to put their criminals into. And she has resettled them into your communities to prey upon innocent Americans. And that’s what they’re doing. You just take a look at what’s going on in Colorado. Take a look at what’s going on there. They’re taking over. They’re in the real estate business like I am. The only difference is I go out and borrow nice money from a bank. They do it with guns. You see what’s going on in Aurora? But it’s not just Aurora. It’s hundreds of communities. They don’t want to talk about it, because they don’t want to destroy the reputation of the community. And they better start talking about it because they won’t have a community.
(41:03)
When I win on November 5th, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins. It’s going to begin. Are you from yesterday? Is that you? Is that you from yesterday? Yesterday? One of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gang that Kamala has imported into our country. She’s, “Let him just come in.” Remember, she’s a stupid person. Open borders. Open borders. As soon as I saw it, I said, “Well, wait a minute. I know the world.” I know many of the leaders of the world, other than the ones that were changed. Not that many. I know them. They’re smart. They’re street wise. Very street wise people. I said, “Wait a minute, they’re going to let all their prisoners out into our country.” When you have open borders, there’s no check-in, there’s no vetting.
(42:06)
And very importantly, border patrol, they’re phenomenal. They endorsed me last week with the strongest endorsement that you’ve ever seen. Unanimous. Unanimous. And in the endorsement, they said, “She’s so bad, there’s never been anybody bad.” That by itself should cause her… Thousands of people voted for me, unanimous endorsement of the border patrol, because we had the safest border. But bring down my favorite chart. I love this chart. I sleep with this chart. I kiss this chart every night. I love it. I love this chart. I love that. Beautiful. Every night I roll it up and I kiss it, because I wouldn’t be here right now without that chart.
(42:58)
I look to my right and I said, ” What the hell happened?” But look at that arrow on the bottom. That’s when I left office. That’s the day I left office right there. That’s the lowest we’ve ever had. This was done by border patrol, by the way. And look what happened after I left. There was an explosion like one of Elon’s rocket ships. Look at that. How good is Elon, by the way? Is he good? Here’s a guy, when you talk about… He is so smart. We are inside beautiful place, beautiful arena packed, nice, probably 71 degrees. We finally have air conditioning. Some of these things don’t have air conditioning. It’s brutal.
(43:39)
Congratulations to the people who own this place, whoever the hell owns it. We appreciate the air conditioning, but it’s like 71 degrees. It’s beautiful. Elon is right now in Pennsylvania politicking, because he thinks this is the most important election in history. And he says, “We won’t have a country.” How cool is that? And he’s registering voters. He’s an amazing guy. How cool was the rocket ship that landed the other day? I never saw it. I don’t want to… if you heard it, just turn off your ears for a second. I’m talking to a very important guy and I have the no sound on the teller muted, and I’m looking at the teller and talking to this guy.
(44:24)
Very important, but quite boring to be honest with you. I hope he doesn’t watch me say this ,because he’ll be able to figure out who it is. But anyway, I said, “Wait a minute, would you hold on please, just for a second?” Because I’m looking at the screen. I’m seeing this 20-story, huge tube pouring down and fire’s pouring out of it. And it used to be white, but the heat is thousands of degrees coming down. They say thousands and thousands, so it’s been beat up in that trip down. And I see this massive tube is coming down, and the fire’s burning, and brights for us, exploding all over the place. I said, “Oh, my, this is terrible. It’s going to crash. What the hell is it?” I wasn’t even sure. Maybe it was a movie.
(45:06)
But I’m looking, it’s the news. And I see it and then all of a sudden it’s going to hit the gantry, and a flame comes out of the left, and pushes it over like it was nothing. I say, “What the hell?” And then… And then these two giant arms come. They envelop it like a beautiful… I won’t say it. I get myself into too much trouble. When I say that stuff, it’s so great. I’d like to, but I’m not going to because I’m going to be politically correct, if you don’t mind. You know what Elon says? “Like two giant chopsticks.” See, wouldn’t I be better off if I said that? Wouldn’t that, Mr. Wall? This guy is the greatest guy. Stand up. I love this guy. Comes to so many of these.
(45:58)
And he’s a very successful guy, but he likes these rallies. He’s had a lot of them. And we have the ladies from North Carolina here too. Would you stand up? I call them the beautiful ladies from North Carolina. And you’re not allowed to call ladies beautiful anymore. It’s the end of your political career. If you say, “Aren’t they beautiful?” That’s the end of your political career, but who cares? You are beautiful. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. What number is this? 230 or 240 or something? And they’re happily married, because I’ve met their husbands. Their husbands are really nice. I don’t know how the hell they put up with this stuff, but at least here we’re in North Carolina. How long a trip was this? Pretty short, right?

Speaker 1 (46:40):

Two and a half hours.

Donald Trump (46:41):

Well, that’s a long time, two and a half. That’s like short compared to Texas, California. Thank you very much. It’s a great honor. It’s always nice to them. They’re always so brightly dressed. They got plenty of cash. They’re so brightly and beautifully dressed all the time. And quaffed, they’re beautifully quaffed. Thank you very much. Great honor. Thank you. And we have our front road Jacks. We have our front row Jacks and Joes. Thank you very much. What happened? You’re not in the front row. These must be very powerful people in the front. Look at these people. Who are these people? They kept the wall back there. Wow, we got to figure this out. That young man must be a very powerful guy, but we appreciate it.
(47:27)
We’ve had a lot of rallies and we’re going to have our biggest of all at Madison Square Garden. We’re going to make a play for New York. Hasn’t been won in many, many decades. But with what’s going on in New York between the illegal migrants and the crime they’re causing, and hurting people so badly, and all of the problems in New York, we’re going to give it a hell of a shot. So, we took Madison Square Garden. We filled it up. Think of this, sold out in three hours. Done. Can you imagine? And I don’t say this in any way, I just say if a politician… Take our best politician. After me, take our best politician. If you had 250, 300 people, you’d have 300 people in a ballroom or something.
(48:20)
Ronald Reagan would have 350 people, 400 people. We sell out these things 25,000 people at Madison Square Garden, because we use the floor, the basketball. So, we have the whole thing. Holds 18 or 19,000. We have the floor and it’s sold out in three hours. So, that’s a great honor. But we’re going to do do a big one in the Atlanta arena. We’re trying to sign the Philadelphia arena. We had tremendous success in Long Island, where the ice hockey team plays, the Islanders. And we could have sold that thing out four times. It was incredible. So, we’re doing them. And it’s sad because we’re sort of wrapping it up, you know that, right?
(49:03)
We’ve been doing this now for a long time. We had two unbelievable elections. We had two. No, no. But we are. I didn’t even think of it. I was being interviewed by a very good person today, actually. And that person said, “When you did Madison Square Garden, it’s in a week.” They said, “Is that sort of wrapping it all up?” And I said, “I never thought of it that way, but I guess you could.” We have a few days left after that, but we sort of are. When you think we’ve been doing it from 2015, and now we’re where we are. So, we’re talking about nine years, almost 10 years by the time we do it.
(49:50)
And think of what we’ve done. This is the greatest movement in political history. I mean, there’s never been anything like that. The greatest movement in political history. Oh, look, there’s Uncle Sam back there. Look at that guy. He shook my hand. This guy’s got the hardest handshake. My hand is still recovering from his handshake. Uncle Sam, how are you? And I have no idea who he is, I promise you. Somebody says, “Oh, do you pay these people?” I don’t pay him. I don’t pay the Wall, I don’t pay Uncle Sam, but they’re incredible patriots. And you know what? They’re very smart people. They’re incredible people. But this is like a football game to some. They come in, these guys, they’re accountants. They head accounting firms, law firms, and they got the name of some football player in the back. I don’t know if I could do that.
(50:40)
Well, maybe Lawrence Taylor, he’s my friend. I’ll come in with a Lawrence Taylor. These are all guys. We have a lot of endorsements from athletes, that I can tell you. But thank you, Uncle Sam. But it’s sort of interesting. I never thought of it. We’re wrapping it up. We’re wrapping up something that has been incredible. There’s never been anything like this, the rallies, the size of them, the enthusiasm. And we have more enthusiasm now than we did for 2016 or 2020. But we really started in 2015, about a year before, a little less than a year before. We started in 2015. And it’s been really amazing. It’s been great to be with you, and now we want to close it out with a beautiful bang. And we want to straighten out the country.

Speaker 2 (51:33):

We pray for you.

Donald Trump (51:36):

Thank you, darling. I pray for you, too. Thank you. Thank you. But it’s been like a movement of love. When we first started, there used to be some fights and there were problems where you have fight. Not much, but we had some. And I don’t want to jinx it by saying, but it’s been like love. It’s been amazing. It is. And you know what? The people back there, when I say things, if I’m a little bit off, they’ll go headlines, headlines. And I don’t mean to be a little bit off, but this is the single-greatest political movement in the history of our country. There’s never been anything like that.
(52:27)
And if it wasn’t, if it were just slightly behind some other movement that nobody could even come close to talking about, they would have headlines. I have to be very careful when I say things. So, he said that. And he said, “Is this wrapping it up?” And I never thought of it. I didn’t think of it that way. We’re in the heart of battle and we have to win our country. And then we’re going to have four great years. And that’s a different kind of a battle. But for what we’re doing for the campaigning, we’re 14 days from wrapping it up. And we’re going to have different kinds of get togethers. And hopefully, it’s going to be get togethers of success. We’re going to base it on success. We’re going to have great success with this country.
(53:16)
We’re going to bring back our businesses. We’re going to stop crime in the streets. We’re going to close up our borders. We’re going to let people come in to our country, but we need people to take all these jobs that will… We’re going to be creating a lot of jobs just by the very smart use of tariffs, taxes, and incentives, just like I told you. Just come up with one. And literally, I did it with a friend of mine who’s a great business person. I said, “What do you think of the idea, like the idea of the deduction for a car, interest deduction for a car?” But then I said, “But to get it, you have to build a car in the United States.” Who would think of that?
(53:55)
It sounds simple, like the paperclip. It’s very simple. Somebody came up 129 years ago or something, they came up with a paperclip. And other people looked at it and they said, “Why didn’t I think of this idea?” And now you’ll have everybody come out and say, “We’re going to deduct interest.” But you know what? It doesn’t have the same ring. No, that’s a big deal. We’re going to make so many cars in Detroit with that. That’s going to be so big. But I said, “Wait a minute, if I do this, what are we going to do? Make more cars in China?” China, I put a tariff on Chinese. Cut 27.5%. And because of that, they’re not flooding our country.
(54:28)
They’re destroying Europe. They’re just flooding Europe with cars. But we’ve kept our car companies, but it’s a fraction of what it used to be. We had the glory days. We were making everybody’s cars. The Cadillac was the most beautiful. To my father having a Cadillac, he’d get a Cadillac every two years. That was his definition of luxury. “I just want a Cadillac every two years” And today, they don’t talk so much about that.

Speaker 2 (54:57):

What about our military? Tell me about that.

Donald Trump (54:59):

We’re going to take care of our military better. We’re going to take care of our military better than anybody. With our military, we took care of our veterans better than anybody has ever taken care. We took care of our veterans. We got a 92% approval rating, and now it’s back down to 44 or 43. We did choice. We had choice. So, if a person had to wait of a — one of our great, because I call them heroes, one of our great heroes had to wait for a doctor. If they had to wait more than one day, they go out and they get a doctor, we pay the bill. And in the end, not only was it good for them, it was also even efficient because some of these people were dying.
(55:42)
They’d wait for four, five, six, seven months. And we have great doctors in the VA, but the problem was the administration. And our guys did a fantastic job. We did another thing in the VA. We got rid of all the sadists and the sickos or wackos. You couldn’t farm, because the civil service laws. And I got this all passed. We got this all passed in Congress. It was an amazing thing, to get it passed in Congress. They’ve been trying for 58 years for one and for 54 years for the other. And it worked out great. And now I understand that as of like yesterday, they’re trying to get rid of, they call it choice, where you have a choice of going outside, getting a doctor.
(56:19)
And I understand that they’re trying to end that program. They don’t like that program. That this group of people that have no idea what they’re doing, don’t like it, so they’ll go back to waiting. But we’ll get it back. We’ll get it back so fast your head will spin. They want to end it. They don’t like it for some reason. I don’t know why, but they don’t like it. People were getting instant care and it wasn’t very expensive. When you take into the fact that, and just take a look at this, you have a guy, he gets sicker, sicker, sicker, sicker, then he becomes terminally ill and they have to take care. In the end, I think it’s probably cost-effective, but I don’t even care about the cost in that case. We take care of our people.
(56:58)
Who would want to wait months to get, in some cases, a simple pill or a simple shot? And it was a terrible thing. But we had a 92% approval rating, the highest ever. The people that I had there did a fantastic job. We’re going to bring it all back. We’re going to bring it back fast. And one other thing, I mean, isn’t it nice to have a president that doesn’t have to read these stupid teleprompters? Isn’t it? Sort of interesting. I haven’t looked at them in the last 15 minutes. It’s interesting. But I just do what we have to do. But we did another program, Right to Try. It’s the greatest thing. For 51 years, they’ve been trying to get it, because we have the best doctors, the best lab technicians, the best labs, the best everything. And nobody could get it done, where we’d have something that really looked good for a certain disease or problem.

Donald Trump (58:00):

It really looked good, but they couldn’t do anything because the FDA wouldn’t be able to approve it for years. I got that number way down, by the way, but they wouldn’t be able to approve it for years, and what would happen was terrible. They would go to Asia. They’d go to Europe. They’d go all over if they had money. Most of them didn’t have money. They’d go home and they’d die. They’d die. So I said, “We got to do something about this.” And they’ve been trying for 50 years. They couldn’t get it done because the doctors didn’t want it because of the liability. The insurance companies certainly didn’t want it. The labs didn’t want it. Nobody wanted it, but they knew it was good, but they didn’t want it.
(58:37)
I got everybody into a room and I said, “Listen, we’re going to sign an agreement. There’s not going to be any liability to anybody. If somebody’s terminally ill, they’re going to sign a document that they’re not going to sue the insurance company, their family. They’re not going to sue anybody. They’re not going to sue the doctor, the lab. They’re not going to sue anybody. Everything’s going to be fine, and we’re going to try it and see how it works.”
(58:59)
It’s been so successful. We have saved thousands and thousands of lives with this new medicine. It’s a new age. I call it new age medicine, but we’ve saved thousands of people. People don’t write about it. It’s called right to try. A lot of people don’t … I hope nobody needs it, to be honest with you, but it’s been so … I’ve never read anything about it. They don’t want to write about it, and if they don’t, that’s okay. The fact is that thousands of people have been saved, their lives have been saved, and many were terminal, and now they’re actually okay. They’re not even terminal. It’s not like they have to even go. It literally cured …
(59:39)
And even the doctors now and the medical companies, the labs, they’re really happy they did it because when you can cure somebody when they’re that sick, it really shows it worked. It sort of worked out the opposite. It really shows that it worked. So right to try. It’s been a great thing and we’re honored to have done it.
(59:59)
One of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gangs that Kamala has imported into our country, the savage Venezuelan prison gang they form in the Venezuelan prisons. It’s called Tren de Aragua that’s taking over apartment complexes and unleashing a violent terrorist spree in our country. Let’s take a look. Take a look at this.

Video (01:00:24):

Opened borders had the consequences.
(01:00:25)
[inaudible 01:00:28]
(01:00:25)
High crossings are putting a strain on cities across America.
(01:00:32)
It is a full-blown invasion.
(01:00:33)
Armed Venezuelan gang members storming an apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado.
(01:00:38)
And when people talk about migrant crime, this is what they’re talking about.
(01:00:41)
Biden and Harris had created a program to bring them in under humanitarian parole.
(01:00:45)
I am in favor of saying that we’re not going to treat people who are undocumented across the border as criminals.
(01:00:50)
More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder have been released into the United States.
(01:00:57)
My 20-year-old daughter Kayla Hamilton was murdered in her own room. Kayla’s murderer was apprehended by border patrol crossing illegally into the US.
(01:01:06)
Kayla’s murderer had been improperly released into the United States.
(01:01:09)
Abolish ICE.
(01:01:10)
Yeah. We need to probably think about starting from scratch.
(01:01:13)
An Afghan national is in custody today after being accused of plotting an election day terrorist attack. The suspect entered the US on a special immigrant visa.
(01:01:21)
More than a dozen people suspected of being Tren de Aragua gang members right here in San Antonio.
(01:01:26)
The gang members had been terrorizing the apartment complex.
(01:01:29)
New details in the murder of Laken Riley.
(01:01:31)
The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuelan national.
(01:01:36)
And was paroled and released into the country by the Biden administration.
(01:01:40)
Two men, investigators say, are in the country, illegally from Venezuela are charged with capital murder and the death of Jocelyn Nungaray.
(01:01:47)
Court documents suggest a group of men arrested for beating and robbing a Dallas woman last month are members of a Venezuelan Street gang.
(01:01:54)
Manuel Hernandez-Hernandez was booked by Colleyville Police just two days earlier and released the day before the robbery.

Donald Trump (01:02:05):

That’s what’s happening. These are the people we’re letting in. And you remember where she was saying that they don’t commit crimes like our people. Really? These are worse than anybody. They make our criminals look like they’re nice people. These are rough, horrible people. They could not be allowed to stay in our country.
(01:02:24)
The United States is now an occupied country in effect, but on November 5th, 2024, we will have a thing called Liberation Day. We’re going to have liberation Day. In the last year alone, over 70,000 illegal aliens from China have crossed our border. You know about that? Many of them military-aged men, 70,000 in a year. 70,000, that’s getting to be army territory, and that’s the equivalent of over 14 brigades or five army divisions of Chinese illegals that have penetrated our country. Again, these are military aged, mostly men, almost all men. Isn’t that wonderful? Isn’t that nice? On the borders are Harris, she has no idea. The woman doesn’t have a clue. Again, she’s sleeping now while I’m working my ass off.
(01:03:20)
On the borders are Harris, there have been at least two million gotaways. That’s gotaways. They come through and nobody knows where the hell they’re from. And that’s by the way, nobody has any idea. If they think it’s two million is probably five times that amount. Two million gotaways from all over the world who charged the border and disappeared into the United States. They could be living right next to you. North Carolina, lovely house, little cabin right next to you. More than the entire active duty force of the United States military. This is the kind of numbers we’re talking about. And they’re rough. They’re rough people.
(01:04:01)
Who would’ve allowed this to happen? The only good thing coming from this crime against our country is if you happen to be the person that’s running against the idiots that allowed it to take place, that’s me. I’m running against them. It’s good to run against it, but I’d rather not be running against it, and I’d rather not have it happen. Immediately upon taking the oath of office, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. We have no idea. We have no choice. It’s not sustainable.
(01:04:38)
I will rescue every town across America that’s been invaded and conquered. They’re conquering. They’re conquering towns. And these fools, these stupid people back there, the media, they’re going to say, “Oh, he used the word, conquer.” You know the governor of Colorado, he’s a radical left Democrat, he’s petrified of … He doesn’t know what to do. And we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in a jail or kick them the hell out of our country as fast as we can.
(01:05:08)
And to expedite removals of Tren de Aragua and other savage gangs, I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Think of that, 1798. You know why? That’s when we had real politicians, real people, real people that knew what to do, not these weak woke fools. So I have to go back to 1798. Can you believe it? But it’s a strong one. Think of it. Alien Enemies Act of 1798, and they used it to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil to make our people safe. And if they come back into our country, it’s an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole. And I am hereby calling for the death penalty. And we have to do this. I’m calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or an enforcement law enforcement officer.
(01:06:23)
You kill an American citizen or a law enforcement officer, you get the death penalty and we’ll get that approved too, because Congress is going to approve it. They’re feeling the way you are. I will end catch and release. Thank you.

Crowd (01:06:41):

USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA!

Donald Trump (01:07:03):

I have to ask this man in the black. Are you the man that I met yesterday or not?

Crowd (01:07:06):

No, you didn’t meet me but I love you, man!

Donald Trump (01:07:13):

That’s a pretty … You’re just as good. I met some great people yesterday. I saw the devastation. It was incredible. He just said, “No, you didn’t meet me, but I love you, man.” Thank you. That’s cool. You’re very cool. You are very cool. Thank you.

Crowd (01:07:27):

[inaudible 01:07:29].

Donald Trump (01:07:29):

I will end … Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. I will end all migrant flights. They fly in by plane. They come in. We only learned that less than a year ago. They said, “We’re going to start closing up the border a little bit.” Well, all they have to do … She could walk into the White House, say, “Wake Biden up. I want him to sign something.” And all he has to do is say, “Close the border.” He doesn’t need a bill. The bill was so horrible. He says, “Donald Trump called the Senate and said, don’t pass it.” It’s wonderful. I wish I could do that. Okay, not that easy. But the truth is, I had nothing to do with it, and I would be proud to do it because it was such a bad bill. But he doesn’t need a bill. I didn’t have a bill. I closed the board. I had the safest border. You see it.
(01:08:28)
I had the safest border in the history of our country. We now have the worst border in the history of the world. Maybe in the history of the world. And again, it’s the number one thing to campaign on. I mean, I think the inflation is horrible, the economy, everything. We have a lot of bad things. The number one, you see those killers, those guys that have military style weapons, I mean, people are saying, “Where the hell do people coming out of Venezuela, young thugs that are tough as hell, by the way, where do they get this equipment?” But I think it’s the number one thing that we’re going to have it fixed. I fixed it in 2016. I fixed it. I did it so good. I couldn’t talk about it for the next election. My people said, “Sir, they don’t want to hear about the border.”
(01:09:10)
I said, “What do you mean you don’t want to hear? I did such a great job. I fixed it. We had the best border.” But that border was 5% of what it is now. That border was bad. It was really bad, but it wasn’t very tough for me to fix. That border was nothing compared to the mess you have now. We don’t have a border. And I built hundreds of miles of wall. I built much more than I said I was going to build. Then we added 200 and they didn’t want to put up the slats. And you know what they did? Many of them were sold for 5 cents on the dollar. It’s just so sold. I will outlaw sanctuary cities immediately, and I will ban all welfare and federal benefits for illegals.
(01:09:55)
We are running against the most radical, most incompetent, most unfit vice president running for president. Can you believe it? In the history of our country. She’s totally unfit for office. No one respects her. No one trusts her. No one takes her seriously. And something is clearly wrong with her. Something is wrong with her. Something’s wrong with her, and something’s wrong with his vice president. He is off. She can’t put two sentences together. How about 60 minutes was that the greatest? We’re probably going to sue them just for the hell of it. Listen, listen. 60 minutes, she interviews. She was so bad. She gave an answer. This never happened to me. Why does it happen? She gave an answer that was so bad that they changed it. They took it out, threw it out. They didn’t edit a little bit. Take a word out. No, no, no. They took the entire … It was a long stupid … She didn’t know where the hell she was going. Does she drink? Is she on drugs? I don’t know. I have no idea. She writes big 60 minutes CBS. You know they have to be licensed by the federal government. They should take their license away. What they did? CBS … And they’re all bad. How about David Muir? How bad is he? How bad is he? I said, “Crime is going up.” And he said, “No, it’s not. It’s going down.” I said, “It’s going up.” He said, “Crime is going down. Next question.”The next day they released the numbers crime’s up 45% in our country. I don’t watch him anymore. Pretty boy. Little pretty boy, he is.
(01:11:50)
Think it. She gives this horrible answer. They take every word of it and they throw it away and they insert another answer. That’s called election interference. And it’s called fraud. And they should have their … And you know, all the other guys back there are sticking up for them. You know why? Because they do the same thing, probably. They don’t do it for me. You know what they do with me? They make my answer worse. They write … No, they take out, like if I give … I do the weave, you know the weave? I’ll tell the story and I’ll go from here being … It’s actually genius, I have to say, fair and smart. People say it’s total genius, but they say, “Oh, he wandered.” I didn’t wander. Wander is when you don’t get back to the same point. Now, I give the weave. They don’t do anything for me.
(01:12:40)
What they do with me is I give a beautiful paragraph and they’ll take some of the primary sentences out. And that’s terrible to do, but that you can sort of get away with. I can even understand it. They want to make it a little shorter. They want a little more time. They don’t pay anything for their license. They have a license that’s worth billions of dollars. They don’t pay anything. Neither does NBC fake news. And ABC fake news is really one of the worst. I will tell you, ABC. But this is CBS. They don’t pay for … They use our airwaves. They don’t pay anything. And then you hear that 60 Minutes, which is a news show. It’s under their news division. So they’re not allowed. This isn’t an entertainment show. But they took the sentence … not the sentence. They took a whole paragraph, big paragraph, just word after word when that was like the 32 that I listened to.
(01:13:29)
32 with a teleprompter where she basically choked and froze like a dog. But that was like the 32. They took it out and they inserted a new answer that was more rational, wasn’t great, but it was at least you don’t say, “What’s wrong with this person?” Where did you ever hear them doing that? That’s called election. This is an election. We’re in the middle of an election. She gave a horrible answer on a new show that pays nothing for the airwaves that are worth billions of dollars. And the other networks stick up because they don’t want it to happen to them either. They don’t want to see a bidding contest for who’s going to do the news, but there has to be some kind of justice in this country. You can’t take her answer out, insert a new answer and say, “This is called major election interference fraud.”
(01:14:29)
So we’ll see what happens. I actually think it’s the biggest scandal in broadcast history. I really believe that. I think it’s the biggest scandal. Nobody’s seen anything like it. And people are furious about it, and they all come out with some answer. Well, we did this because of that. They took the answer out. They put a new answer in. There’s nothing. There’s no justification. So we’re probably going to take him to court. Should I take him to court? Okay, so we’ve asked them. We sent them a letter yesterday. We’ve asked for the entire transcript and we want to see, did they do it in other places too? And we’ll see what happens but good. So I have your permission, right?
(01:15:18)
Who would think of these things? I mean, who would think? And it was a mistake. They made a mistake. That’s how everybody found that they made a mistake. They put out the original answer. Somehow somebody saw the original answer, said that’s not the answer she gave. And when they went back, they feel it was … They found out it was a fraud. It was a fraud on the American public, and they should pay a big price for it.
(01:15:41)
And if they do pay a big price, it won’t happen anymore. She’s an international joke and she’s going to end up getting us into World War III and Kamala is in free fall. She’s in free fall with Arab and Muslim voters. Now in Michigan, did you notice that my poll numbers are very good with the Arab voters? Did you see that? My poll numbers are very good. I appreciate it. You know why? You know why? Because I want peace in the Middle East. I want peace. I did the Abraham Accords. I want peace in the Middle East.
(01:16:17)
So it’s very simple. I want to see peace in the Middle East. But my poll numbers in Michigan are very good with the … I was supposed to be zero. She was supposed to be 100. Now I’m beating her because they see how bad she is. But they don’t like or respect her. She’s sent their overseas … I mean, you take a look. She’s sent their jobs overseas. She’s brought in crime to the cities. She’s taken in all of this tremendous fire. She’s okay with it. That took place in the Middle East. But you ask yourself, why would Muslims support lying Kamala Harris when she embraces Muslim hating and very dumb person Liz Cheney? A dumb person who by the way, lost for Congress in the biggest margin in the history of politics. She lost by almost 40 points.
(01:17:14)
The reason she has that honor is that most people, most people wouldn’t have stayed in. A congressperson that’s in that position normally retires before the election, which would’ve been a good idea for her to do. But Liz Cheney is a total loser. But her father brought years of war and death to the Middle East. He killed many, many Arabs and Muslims. And now lying Kamala has embraced Liz Cheney. She embraced her. And why would a Muslim or why would an Arab want to vote for somebody that has Liz Cheney as her hero? Liz Cheney is a totally failed politician. Again, she set the worst record. I think it’s a terrible mistake that she’s made. I think it’s a great insult to Muslims all over the world. And I think that she’s going to do very bad in Michigan. I really do. I think she’s going to do very badly. To do that was a bad thing. And I was very surprised to see it.
(01:18:14)
But in one way, I was happy because you have to understand, I’m competing against her. I’m competing against this stupid person. I think we are winning by a lot. I have a feeling we’re winning by a lot.
(01:18:28)
But this person cannot be president. By the way, is there any place better to be than a Trump rally? And don’t get used to this because it’s only going to go on for another two weeks. It’s really something. It’s only going to go on to … In four years, you’ll be having rallies of 100 people, 200 people. Mr. Wall will be doing other things. Front Row Joes are going to be doing how these guys are boring as hell. We got two more weeks together with our big … We had 101,000 people in Butler. Think of that. We had 107,000 people in New Jersey. We’re making a move for New Jersey too.
(01:19:23)
And two weeks ago in California, we had 109,000 people. So don’t get too used to this. What are you going to do Mr. Wall when you come to a rally and there’s like 150 people, what are you going to do?

Crowd (01:19:37):

[Inaudible 01:19:42].

Donald Trump (01:19:44):

Oh. You like … Right? That’s very good. That’s good. Good man. I’ll tell you that. When the people of North Carolina were stranded and drowning in Hurricane Helene, Kamala Harris was at a glitzy fundraiser in the city that she destroyed, San Francisco. She spent the last four years taking your money to provide shelter and benefits to illegal aliens. But when North Carolina needed help, Kamala Harris was nowhere to be found.
(01:20:21)
They spent your money. They’re going to probably have to call it an emergency meeting, a special session of Congress, because the illegal migrants, many of them killers, many of them drug dealers, many of them released from prison, have taken the money that they were supposed to spend in North Carolina and Georgia and Alabama and Tennessee and Florida and South Carolina.
(01:20:52)
The money was supposed to be spent in those states. And they don’t have the money now. They don’t have the money because they’ve spent hundreds … Think of it, hundreds of millions of dollars they’ve spent flying migrants into states all over the country and letting them go through your porous wall. Kamala Harris does not have the compassion, the smarts, or the strength to be president of the United States. She can’t do the job. She’s not mentally or physically able to do the job. And on top of all of it, she says she would not do anything differently. She would not do anything differently, she said. Then crooked Joe Biden, which is disqualifying. When you see this tape, you’re going to say she’s disqualified. He’s the worst president. 85% wrong direction. What would you do differently? Well, I can’t think of anything now. Let’s take a look.

Video (01:21:51):

Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?
(01:21:58)
There is not a thing that comes to mind.
(01:21:58)
I stood there on the tarmac watching you check your watch.
(01:22:02)
The chaotic and deadly US evacuation from Afghanistan has stunned Americans and the world and cost the lives of 13 US soldiers.
(01:22:10)
Would you have done something differently?
(01:22:11)
There is not a thing that comes to mind.
(01:22:11)
More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder have been caught up for war and then released into the United States.
(01:22:21)
An Afghan national is in custody the day after being accused of plotting an election day terrorist attack. The suspect entered the US on special immigrant visa.
(01:22:21)
[inaudible 01:22:30] bringing you details on the murder of Georgia Nursing student Laken Riley.
(01:22:33)
The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuelan national who crossed the unsecured southern border back in 2022.
(01:22:42)
Too many investigators say are in the country, illegally from Venezuela are charged with capital murder in the death of Jocelyn Nungaray.
(01:22:49)
A fifth illegal immigrant accused of attacking two New York City police officers over the weekend showed no remorse or regret.
(01:22:57)
Would you have done something differently?
(01:22:59)
There is not a thing that comes to mind.
(01:23:01)
Only 18% say the economy is in excellent or good condition.
(01:23:05)
US inflation has hit a new 40-year high, increasing by 9.1% over the financial year.
(01:23:11)
The cost of homes have spiked. Home buyers need to earn 80% more than they did in 2020 to afford a house.
(01:23:19)
Were you the last person in the room?
(01:23:21)
Yes.

Donald Trump (01:23:27):

So North Carolina, if you want to end this disaster, you must go out. Just go out and vote. We got to win this. We got to get this thing. We’re pleased to be joined tonight by some really great people, and one of them I’m very proud of. He’s done a great job as your senator, Ted Budd. Where is Ted? Ted. Thank you, Ted. You’re doing a great job. He’s doing a great job. Proud of you. Ted, really good. Congresswoman Virginia Foxx, a warrior. Thank you, Virginia. Thank you. Congressman Dan Bishop. Thank you, Dan. Thank you. Dan. A man who’s been really fantastic. All I know is they had more people show up in the last four days than in 2016 or 2020. And many of these people lost their homes. They lost everything. And we had more people. We set a record. Can you believe that? That shows enthusiasm.
(01:24:38)
That shows North Carolina GOP Chair, Jason Simmons. Thank you, Jason. Great job. How are we doing, Jason? We’re going to win the state big, I hope, three times in a row, right? Jason’s great. A great friend of mine, and really a friend of my boy, Don Addison McDowell. He’s going to do a fantastic job. Thank you, Addison. Oh, you’re looking better and better. Look at you. Looks like a real congressman. He is going to be fantastic. Somebody that I’ve got a lot of respect for, I have for a long time. From the day I met him, I respect him. He was a very successful businessman. He was a great senator. He is a very special guy. David Perdue. David? Thank you David. Thanks.
(01:25:36)
One of the biggest and best developers around, a man who’s made a lot of money and he’s very generous, including with North Carolina. He writes a check for everything. He’s just a great person, a very generous man. Steve Witkoff. Steve, thank you for the help. Thank you. And Peter Navarro, I hope you heard from him. This guy is great. They say threat to democracy. They’re a threat to democracy. Nobody would’ve done what they did to him. Nobody would’ve done what they did to Peter Navarro. He fought for our country so hard. I was witness to it for four years. That guy fought harder than anybody I know. And then they did what they did to him. They’re a bunch of bad people.
(01:26:27)
They weaponized the Justice Department. They weaponized the FBI. And I’ve had more investigations than any human being, including Alphonse Capone, the meanest, the Scarface. I’ve been investigated more than Alphonse Capone. They even raided my house, little place on the beach called Mar-a-Lago. No, but think of it. They raided my house. Can you believe this is the scum that we have to deal with? This is the scum. What they did to him and other of our friends and friends of the people

Donald Trump (01:27:00):

… people in this room. It’s a disgrace. And Peter, you’re going to go down as a hero. You watch. You watch. Thank you. And we also have former Democrat Congresswoman and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, a woman that everybody loves. I watched her years ago where she just had so much common sense. We’re the party of common sense. I like to say it because it’s true. We don’t want men playing in women’s sports. We want to have borders. We want to have fair elections. Little things like that. Common sense, right? But she’s here tonight, and I’m going to just ask her to come up and say a couple of words. Tulsi Gabbard.

Tulsi Gabbard (01:27:54):

Thank you very much. Aloha.

Multiple speakers (01:28:10):

Aloha.

Tulsi Gabbard (01:28:14):

I was a Democrat for over 20 years. Thank you. Today’s Democrat party is completely unrecognizable, which points to the clear choice that we have in this election today. When you look at the party of Kamala Harris, for example, she is anti-freedom, she is pro-censorship, she is pro-open borders, and she is pro-war, without even pretending to care about peace. As President Trump talked about, she has shamelessly embraced the endorsement and support of warmongers like Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney, and others who care more about power and feeding the military industrial complex than they care about you, the American people, and peace.
(01:29:06)
President Trump has pledged to end wars, not start them. And this is why in the eyes of the Kamala Harris Dick Cheney Democrat party, they will do everything possible to try to destroy him. You’ll see how they have weaponized the federal government. They have weaponized law enforcement, the Department of Justice. They have done everything possible to try to silence him, to try to remove him from the ballot so we the people don’t even have the choice to who we want to vote for. Why have they done this? Because this man has the courage to take them on and root out the deep rot of corruption in the swamp in Washington. Now, voters have made their voices heard loud and clear, not once, not twice, but three times in the last three presidential elections, nominating this man to be the Republican nominee for president because of his commitment to these fundamental American principles of freedom and peace and prosperity.

Tulsi Gabbard (01:30:48):

Now, to those of you here, or those watching at home, who are independent-minded people like myself who love our country and are committed to the constitution and to freedom, the Democrat party has no home for people like us. But we do have a home in the Republican Party where we are welcomed with open arms by President Trump and so many of you who love our country. And it is because of my love for our country, and specifically because of the leadership that President Trump has brought to transform the Republican Party and bring it back to the party of the people and the party of peace, that I’m proud to stand here with you today, President Trump, and announce that I’m joining the Republican Party.
(01:31:46)
I am joining the party of the people, the party of equality, the party that was founded to fight against and end slavery in this country. It is the party of common sense and the party that is led by a president who has the courage and strength to fight for peace. So as we stand here today, we have 14 days until the most historic election of our lives. And my message to my fellow Americans, regardless of your political affiliation, now is the time for us to stand together to save our country. There is nothing less than that. That’s on the line.
(01:32:57)
A vote for President Trump is a vote for a big open tent party that welcomes people from all backgrounds in all walks of life. A vote for President Trump is a vote to express our deep love for our country and our appreciation for our God-given rights and freedoms enshrined in the Constitution. A vote for President Trump is a vote for secure borders and safe communities. And a vote for President Trump is a vote for peace here in America and around the world. I am looking forward to casting my vote for President Trump because you are our best and only hope in this election to lead our country toward a future where every one of us can live in a truly free, peaceful, and prosperous nation. Every single vote will count. This is our opportunity to vote for freedom, to vote for peace, to vote for America, and vote for President Trump to go back to the White House and make America great again. Thank you so much.

Donald Trump (01:34:16):

Wow, I didn’t know that. I didn’t know that. Thank you very much. Tulsi, that’s great. Wow. That was a surprise. She’s been independent for a long time. That’s a great thing, a great honor. Thank you very much, Tulsi. And what a beautiful speech she made, right? Wasn’t that beautiful? I’d like to also honor somebody who really has gone through a lot, and I hope he’s going to really be helping us a lot. He’s got some tremendous ideas for making us healthy and well, and that’s RFK Jr. He’s a very special guy and I just want to thank him because he came in at the same time as Tulsi, and he’s got some incredible thing on your health, on women’s health, and all of the different elements. I may have to fight him a little bit on the environment, because we have to run this country so well, but that’s okay. But he’s really an outstanding guy and it was not an easy decision for him, certainly. But RFK Jr. thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.
(01:36:14)
So here are the facts on Kamala, just in wrapping it up. Oh, you thought he was here? No he wasn’t. I just wondered. No. In spirit, I can guarantee you he’s here. I’ll bring him to the next one, but you won’t be here. No, he’s great. He’s got some really incredible ideas and he’s so committed, it’s incredible, so thank you very much to Bobby.
(01:36:46)
But here are the facts on Kamala Harris. She’s a radical left Marxist, rated even worse than crazy Bernie Sanders or Pocahontas. She destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of defund the police movement, and anybody who wants to defund the police, even for a day or a week, is not worthy of being President of the United States. Can’t be. Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE. These are great, powerful people, strong people, because that’s their job. They have to get some of the worst gang members and drug dealers and everything else out of our country. I know a lot of great tough people right here, but they don’t want that job. But she wants to get rid of them. She wants to take them out. We’re not taking them out. We’re going to make them bigger and stronger because we have a lot of work to do in cleaning up our country and making our country safe.
(01:37:44)
She vowed repeatedly to ban fracking as California Attorney General. You know this. As California Attorney General, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon, and rape of an unconscious person as a totally nonviolent crime. Think of that. She’s so far left. She pledged to confiscate your guns and endorsed a total ban on handgun ownership. You know that as soon as that comes up, she will guaranteed confiscate your guns. And she even called for free sex changes for illegal aliens in detention, all at taxpayer expense. And as you know, we had a little trip to McDonald’s a couple of days ago, and she lied about working at McDonald’s. It was a part of her story. “I worked over the french fries,” so I decided to see what it was like.
(01:38:51)
And those french fries were good. They were right out of whatever the hell they may come out of. No, but think of it. And the press refuses to acknowledge it. They refuse to cover it. They have tried. McDonald’s denies it. And she never worked there. She never worked there. Some people went and really did spend a lot of time on it. No, she lied and she’s a liar. And on top of all of this, Kamala turned our military as woke as it can be, which is not woke because they are great. What they did for me with ISIS was… These are not woke people. But take a look.

Donald Trump (01:41:12):

Thank you. You got to remember, we won two world wars. We won a lot of things. Well, most recently we did defeat ISIS and they said that couldn’t be done. It was going to take five years. It took four weeks. We have a great military and they’re not woke. Some of the stupid people up top are woke, but they’re not woke. You couldn’t make them woke if you tried. You couldn’t make them. You could put them in what’s called a woke cage for two years and they’d come out fighting, believe me. So in conclusion, with your vote this November, we are going to fire Kamala Harris and we are going to save America. With your support, we will cut your taxes and inflation slash your prices, raise your wages and bring thousands of factories back to America and back to North Carolina. They’re coming back.
(01:42:11)
We will build American, we will buy American, and we will hire American again. I will end the war in Ukraine very quickly. I will stop the chaos in the Middle East and I will prevent World War III from happening. We’re so close. The biggest risk is this number of months before January 20th. We will crush the violent crime that’s plaguing our cities and give our police the support, protection, resources and respect they so dearly deserve. They will stop the crime. We will strengthen and modernize our military. We rebuilt the entire military, and then a lot of our military was given to Afghanistan. Isn’t that nice? Think of that. How about that? That was the most embarrassing moment in the history. 13 dead soldiers, many, many horrifically wounded with arms and legs obliterated. They gave billions of dollars of equipment. They didn’t take Bagram, the air base. They should have kept Bagram. It’s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear missiles. Isn’t that nice? They didn’t take it.
(01:43:23)
And we left people behind. We left Americans behind. They moved the military out first. A child. I had one of the rallies and I had his little five or six-year-old boy in the front row. And I called him up to the stage. His mother was horrified. I understand that. But he was up here, little kid. And I said, –, I gave him the facts in about two minutes. I said, “Would you move the military out first or last?” “I’d move the military out last, sir.” These stupid people moved the military out first. And you know, I didn’t lose one soldier in 18 months. I had a talk with Abdul, who was the head of the Taliban. Abdul. Still there. He’s still the head. And we had a talk because they were killing a lot of our soldiers with sniper fire and other things, and a lot of them with Obama and Biden, but basically Obama. I don’t think Biden knew where the hell he was then either. So they were killing our soldiers. And I told them, I don’t have to get into the conversation, for 18 months we didn’t lose one soldier.
(01:44:28)
Then we had a tragic election. Tragic. Think of our country. We wouldn’t have had inflation. Least importantly, we wouldn’t have had inflation, but we wouldn’t have had Russia going into Ukraine. Zero chance. Zero. Wouldn’t have ever happened. And it didn’t happen for four years. Even the Democrats, most of them agreed, the honest ones, which there aren’t too many of them. But even they say wouldn’t have happened. And October 7th with Israel would’ve never happened. They wouldn’t have killed all those people. Those people were killed. And the hostages, now they’re waiting for the hostages. There won’t be many hostages. They’re not going to be a lot of hostages. Those people are probably long gone. I’ve been saying that for a long time. That’s part of the problem. The other side doesn’t know what to do because they don’t have the hostages. It’s a very sad situation. That would’ve never happened. All these things would’ve never happened.
(01:45:22)
Think of the difference in the world. Viktor Orban, the head of Hungary, Prime Minister of Hungary, very powerful guy. They asked him, they said to him, “What’s going on in the world? It’s blowing up in the Middle East. It’s blowing up with Russia, Ukraine. What’s going on? You didn’t have any of this stuff when Trump was here. What is going on?” He said, “The problem is you don’t have Trump. You put Trump back, it’s all going to be better. They would’ve never done this with Trump as president.” It’s interesting. Peter knows. Right, Peter? We will build a missile defense shield all around our country. We’re going to be safe. We’re going to be made in the USA. It’s going to be made in North Carolina, partially. We’ll land an American astronaut on Mars and we’ll call Elon. Let’s get going. We want to do that, but we really want to.
(01:46:14)
And as part of that, we were in big trouble in space. China was lapping us, and Russia was lapping us. And I created Space Force. And now we’re lapping the whole world with Space Force. They’ve done a great job. Part of that whole thing is about military and military protection. It’s going to be a very important. It’s going to be one of the really best decisions we ever made, doing Space Force. We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington, D.C., making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. We will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag.
(01:46:57)
And we’re going to go to Congress and ask very strongly, because that little riot that they had three months ago, they were burning American flags all over the place. We’re going to ask Congress to… They say it’s unconstitutional. I disagree. To give a one-year prison sentence for anybody burning the American flag. Early on. That’s right. That’s very nice. Very good. You came prepared. Look at you. We will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools. And we will keep men out of women’s sports. I will defend religious liberty, I will restore free speech, and I will defend the right to keep and bear arms, our Second Amendment. After years of building up foreign nations, defending foreign borders and protecting foreign lands, we are finally going to build up our country and defend our borders and protect our citizens. And we will stop illegal immigration once and for all and it will be stopped. And again, we’re going to let people into our country, but they’re going to come into our country legally. We will not be invaded. We will not be occupied. We will not be conquered. We will be a free and proud nation once again. Everyone will prosper. Every family will thrive and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left lunatic agenda. And we have to have a landslide of an election that’s too big to rig. You have to get out. You got to get out. Early. Voting is underway. So get everyone, get your friends, get your family. Get Alice to get her husband who just will not get off that couch.
(01:49:17)
“Come on, Jack. Let’s go. Jack, you got to do it, Jack. You can do it. Turn off the television just for an hour. We’ll be right back. Jack. Turn off that football game. It doesn’t really mean anything, Jack.” Especially with the new kickoff return. Did you ever see anything so stupid in your life? They have to ruin things at work. Is that the most ridiculous thing you’ve ever seen?
(01:49:43)
After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of our country. With your help now until election day, we will redeem America’s promise. We will put America first and we will take back the nation that we love. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And we will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. And we will never, ever, ever, ever surrender. Together, we will fight, fight, fight and win, win, win. November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country. And together, we will make America powerful again, make America wealthy again, make America healthy again. Come on, Bobby. Bobby’s going to do it. Bobby. Let’s go, Bobby. You’re going to make us healthy, Bobby. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. God bless you. God bless you.

That I’m proud to be an American where at least I know I’m free.
(01:25)
And I won’t forget the men who died who gave that right to me.
(01:28)
And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today.
(01:48)
Cause there ain’t no doubt I love this land… love this land.
(01:48)
God Bless the USA.
(01:48)
And I’m proud to be an American where at least I know I’m free.
(01:48)
And I won’t forget the men who died who gave that right to me.
(01:48)
And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today.
(01:48)
Cause there ain’t no doubt I love this land… love this land.
(01:48)
God Bless the USA.

Audience (01:48):

Fight, fight, fight!

Donald Trump (01:48):

Wow, got so quiet.

Speaker 2 (01:48):

America needs Donald Trump. Residents for Trump. Woo, yeah.

Donald Trump (03:11):

Well, thank you very much everybody. Great honor. I just saw a poll that we’re actually leading with Hispanics. That’s never happened before. I don’t know, but it’s going to be close. I mean, she’s sleeping right now. She couldn’t go on the trail. You’d think when you have 14 days left, you wouldn’t be sleeping. She’s not doing anything today. I should take one of that. We’ve gone 52 days in a row and I’m going 14 more days and we’re going to have a big victory party hopefully, and we’re going to turn our country around. We’re going to make it great again, as I say.
(03:45)
We’re going to make America great again. But we are joined by a lot of fantastic people, a lot of great political people, and it really is an honor to have you at Doral especially. This has been a very special place for me. It’s been a great, great success. I want to thank all of the representatives from the Doral area because the mayor and everybody, where’s Christi? Is she around? Let’s see.

Christi Fraga (04:13):

Right here.

Donald Trump (04:13):

Christi. Christi. Oh, Christi. Christi. Oh, my Christi. Boy, oh boy. Hi, Christi. Hi, sweetie. You’ve been so great. We’ve been so great and we worked together for a long time, right?

Christi Fraga (04:25):

Yeah. 13 years.

Donald Trump (04:26):

Although she’s so young, it’s not that long. I can’t be that long, but it is 13 years. Wow.

Christi Fraga (04:32):

Since you bought the resort.

Donald Trump (04:33):

That’s pretty good. Yeah, since I bought it. And you’ve been great. Thank you very much for everything.
(04:37)
And we’re going to just say a few words. We’re going to talk about what’s happening with the election. We’ll take some questions from the fake news. And we will get on with it. We have a great panel today and I appreciate it. We have some real religious leaders. They’re the most powerful ones on the panel by far. Right? Right, Christi?

Christi Fraga (05:00):

Yes. Yes.

Donald Trump (05:00):

They’re the most powerful. And look at that gentleman. That’s the biggest church I’ve ever seen in my life, right? When we need overflow, we use your church and we get great people in that church and you are fantastic.
(05:15)
So I want to thank all of the people that have been supporting us for so long and so strongly. We’re doing very well. The polls are looking great, and I think maybe more important than even the polls are the initial numbers are looking incredible.
(05:30)
In North Carolina, I was there, I did three stops there actually yesterday and one quite a week, right after this horrible event happened. But in North Carolina, we have just an amazing result going on because we were expected to maybe have 50% of the vote or 30%. Nobody knew what was going to happen. That place was… The people wiped out. And in some of the worst- hit sections, they had more people voting than they had in 2016 or in 2020. Can you believe it?

Speaker 3 (06:07):

Wow.

Donald Trump (06:07):

Nobody expected that. They thought if we got 50%. I mean, you have to see the homes were just absolutely leveled, floated away many of them. And there was death. There was death. And FEMA’s responded not well. The White House has done a very poor job. They should be ashamed of themselves actually.
(06:25)
But the people kicked in. Franklin Graham’s been fantastic and we’ve raised a lot of money. We’ve raised a lot of money for the area, lot of money, over $8 million. And we’ve given out to various people that we know do a good job. I met some people there yesterday that were incredible. A couple of them said the nicest things. I think the nicest, the most beautiful things I’ve ever had said about me. I thought I heard everything. I’ve heard everything, good and bad, and they said the most beautiful thing. So I just want to thank them. The words were so beautiful.
(07:04)
So Doral mayor, Christi Fraga, and thank you very much. Miami Mayor, Francis Suarez, wherever Francis is. I just saw him on television. He was on Fox and he was saying the best things about me. And thank you for everything and the endorsement and all. Thanks a lot, Francis. You’re doing a great job too. Both of you. Everybody should have mayors like this. We see some mayors… We see a lot of mayors that aren’t quite as good, I will tell you. And some that aren’t good at all.
(07:38)
The mayor of Hialeah, Esteban Bovo. And you know why I love you is because he named their main street after Trump. Going right into Hialeah, going into the track, it’s Trump. So many people call me, they say… Thank you, mayor. They say, “I just saw the most beautiful street. It’s got your name on it.” And that’s sort of one of the first. And I really appreciate it, Mayor. You’ve been great.
(08:12)
Members of Congress, Maria Alvira Salazar. Thank you. Thank you, Maria, very much. And a friend of mine for a long time, Carlos Jimenez. He’s been a friend of mine for a long time. Where is he? And you were also great today, Carlos. I watched you and you got up and you let him have it. You said how bad she is, how good I am. And I said, “That’s my Carlos.” And she is bad. Look, we don’t need bad people. We had four years of bad and we’re not going to have four more years. The country can’t survive it.
(08:54)
It is amazing. Think of it. I said, “Where is she campaigning today?” “Sir, she’s got a day off.” You got 14 days left for the presidency and she’s taking a day off. This is not what you want. This is not what you want.
(09:07)
Matt. Say hello, Matt, my friend for a long time, huh? A man who has been incredible. He owns Goya, Goya Foods. I eat it whenever I can. So Bob, and everyone knows him, but I think you’re probably the most, well-known. They attacked Bob. He announced that he’s in favor of Trump. And the radical left lunatics went crazy. They just went crazy. And they do things that probably are illegal probably. I think it’s actually illegal. They’ll go after companies, they’ll go after viciously. They’ll go after… They’ll never go after your oil company, but they’ll go after… You wouldn’t stand for it either.
(09:51)
But Bob did something that was amazing. He said… Some people fold because they’re weak and they make a mistake and fold because once you fold, then they go after you again and again. But Bob did it different with Goya. He was very proud of it. And he went out there and he said, “That’s right. We love Trump. We love everything that… Look, they like our policies, number one, he likes our policies. Then he got to like me. But he went and everybody thought, oh, this would be bad for his business. And his business doubled and then tripled. And then… Right? I made him a lot of money because we have tremendous support.
(10:31)
And you’ve been just a great friend for a long time now, right? For a long time. He took some heat at the beginning, but he handled it really incredibly. And whenever I see your food as opposed to some, I eat it. It’s actually quite good out of the can. We do actually travel with cans. You know what? People don’t know that. We do travel with cans. Anyway, I want to thank you very much.
(10:53)
Mario Rodriguez. Mario. Thank you. Thank you. Oh. Thank you, Mario. Do you want to say something, Mario? Yeah. Go ahead.

Mario Rodriguez (11:04):

I mean, Mr. President, it’s amazing what you’ve done for the Hispanic community and you are going to be rewarded handsomely for that.

Donald Trump (11:13):

Thank you. Well, we have, and they’ve rewarded me already. Actually, this love affair has been going on pretty much from the beginning. Now 2016, it was a little early, but then I started producing for them and they produced for the country because the level of genius, entrepreneurship, energy that they have, it’s an incredible community. And I liked them and they liked me. And now they’re seeing numbers that are shocking. They’re seeing numbers… I saw it this morning. An anchor was almost crying. They say, “What’s going on over here?” It’s been a great relationship. Thanks a lot, Mario.
(11:51)
Mercedes Schlapp. Thank you Mercedes very much. Thank you. Thank you, Mercedes. And a man who’s really, he’s got it, Pastor Ramiro Pena. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Pastor. Eduardo, thank you very much for being here. Big movie star from Mexico. He’s done a great movie. We watched it together, Freedom. And really great. And you’re doing another one very soon, I think on a similar subject, right? That’s a very sad subject, but that really did create awareness for a very, very tough situation. So we appreciate it very much. Thank you for being here.

Eduardo (12:32):

Thank you, sir.

Donald Trump (12:33):

Thank you for being here. Rick Scott’s around someplace. Where is Rick? Hello, Rick. Hi, Rick. I just saw a poll. I saw two things. I saw a very nasty commercial about you and it was false. I was going to call you and I said maybe he’s going to be there. Nasty but false. Such a lie. But don’t worry, I have a lot of them about me and it hasn’t affected us. But Rick is fantastic. He was a great governor and he’s a great senator. He’s a great senator. And the good news is is I saw a poll and you’re really doing great. So you’re doing really fantastic, Rick, but just keep it going.
(13:15)
So this election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of total failure because what’s going on now, we are a nation in decline. We’re a failing nation. We’re laughed at all over the world. No matter where you go, they laugh at us. They can’t even believe what’s happening.
(13:32)
And I’ll tell you what, she’s worse than he is and they do lie. I was just saying to Rick the lies. They say the exact… I’ll have 10 different things where I’m this, I’m this, I’m this, I’m this. Everybody knows it. The media knows it. They do nothing to change it. And then they come out with a commercial saying exactly the opposite. I mean, things like I’m in favor of, or let’s say they even say it differently, I’m against fracking. That’s the first time I’ve ever heard it. Trump is against fracking. They do things that is just… And she’s against fracking. But now she says she’s for it.
(14:10)
So I’ve had Hillary. I’ve had Sleepy Joe. I’ve had a lot of people that I’ve run against now. And on a different scale, I work with senators and trying to get them elected. We’re doing very well, the Republicans. We could end up, I don’t want to use numbers, but we could end up surprisingly good right, Rick? It could be a number that people would be shocked at if you would’ve said it even two months ago. And I’m helping all of them, every one of them. And we had some great results. We’ve had some results that are really surprising.
(14:43)
But this is the one, this woman is the worst. The lying, it’s just unbelievable. Like the IVF, the fertilization. I came out totally in favor right from the beginning. She said I’m against it. Carlos, she goes, “He’s totally against it.” Every single item having to do with energy, having to do with everything. And then she’s got the worst governor in the country, probably the worst. I think she made a horrible mistake. We’ll see what happens on November 5th. Let’s see what happens.
(15:16)
But there’s something wrong with him. Honestly. There’s something wrong and there’s something wrong with her too. She’s slow, low IQ, something. I don’t know what the hell it is, but they lie. We don’t need another low IQ person. We had one for four years. We don’t need another one.
(15:35)
But I mean, Crooked Hillary lied, but she didn’t do it like this. I mean, she wouldn’t take things that were so obvious and just say the opposite. They say the exact opposite. And as you know, there are 15 different elements of policy that she changed. She was in favor of sex changes for prisoners at their will, paid for by the government. And now she says, “No, I don’t think that would be a good idea.” She was totally… I mean, when you talk about fracking, she said, “No fracking under… I mean, we have 25 commercials. Sometimes we put them on simultaneously, she’s just… And now all of a sudden, “I love fracking. I think it’s wonderful.”
(16:21)
Although today though, it came out, they had a bad thing come out today. One of her people said she’s essentially against fracking. And it’s very interesting when that came out. It was sort of a big story. One of her top people said that, because that’s where they are, Rick. That’s where they are. They’re against fracking. They’re never going to… And they’re against anything having to do with what’s under the ground. And that’s what Germany just went through it. They almost destroyed themselves. They went into a situation where they were putting windmills all over the place and the wind wasn’t blowing so much. And if they kept that process going, Germany would right now be bust. That’s I guess one of the primary reasons that Angela is not there anymore.
(17:05)
They tried it. They had solar fields. That’s so big. I mean, I saw a solar field come… And I’m in favor of solar, but it’s not the same thing. It’s got fire up these massive plants. It’s not going to… But I saw a solar field the other day that looked like it took up half the desert. I’d never saw anything like it. It’s all steel and glass and wires and looks like hell. And you see rabbits, they get caught in it, for the environmentalists. It’s just terrible.
(17:32)
I like some applications where you have it on a roof or you have it on something, but I’m looking at solar fields that are miles and miles of just… And what it does to your desert areas or the areas that you’re putting it, it’s just crazy. We have stuff right under the ground. Natural gas. We have things that… We had the cleanest air that we’ve ever had during my administration, and yet we also had more jobs, more productivity.

Donald Trump (18:00):

… productivity. We had the best numbers we’ve ever had. We had the lowest taxes we’ve paid in years. So we’re in a race, and we’re really, we’re in a race with some very sick people. They’re liars. They just lie. They lie about everything. And I was going to hit her really hard on the trail today, but now I don’t have to because she’s off. She’s off. No, I can’t get over it. Who the hell takes off when you have 14 days left? And she’ll take a couple of more days off, too. You know why? She’s lazy as hell, and she’s got that reputation. She’s a radical-left lunatic. She’s further left than Bernie Sanders or Pocahontas. Now, Pocahontas… Because I think… Rick, is Pocahontas further left than Bernie? Just about, right? It’s close. It’s close. Who the hell cares, right? Rick says, “Yeah, I don’t know.” But they’re out there.
(18:57)
But she’s the furthest left. We can’t have a person… She’s a Marxist. Her father is a Marxist professor. By the way, the fake news, look at all of them. Where is the father we should interview? Because I’d find it interesting to see what he has to say. He’s… I don’t know. They seem to have a problem. But it would be nice to interview the father. He’s a Marxist professor. And I think that’s okay. That’s good. Fine. I think it’s appropriate that the father be interviewed by the fake news. They don’t want to interview him, and I wonder why. If we had a real press in this country, this wouldn’t even be a race. And I’m not sure it is a race anyway.
(19:35)
They just came out with the Atlanta Constitution. Just came out with a poll that we’re five up in Georgia. We’re up in… And let’s see what happens, because it all doesn’t matter. Because bad things happen. Some very, very bad things happened last time. But this time, we don’t have COVID. And it’s going to be a lot harder for them to do bad things. So we’re going to see. We have tremendous people. We have a lot of lawyers working. We have lawyers working. Numbers of lawyers that nobody has ever seen before. Because we’re not going to play games, because we’re going to lose our country. Our country is failing. We don’t know what we’re doing. We’re laughed at all over the world. President Xi thinks we’re stupid.
(20:23)
Putin thinks we’re stupid. That would have never happened. If I were President, Putin would have never, ever gone into Ukraine. Now we have a number of dead people that’s so much greater than what they say. They knocked down an apartment house that’s two blocks long. They have big buildings in Ukraine. Two blocks long and 20 stories high. And they say one person was slightly injured. No, many people were killed when they did that. And these towns and cities all over Ukraine are knocked down. Millions of people. I mean, when you look at the total number of dead from that war, and it would have never happened, should have never happened. There was zero chance. His energy policy also helped it happen. Because he drove energy through the roof because he doesn’t know what the hell he’s doing.
(21:09)
And if you look at now Israel, October 7th, that would have never happened. But if Bibi Netanyahu followed the plan of Biden, he didn’t want him to do anything. And a bad thing happened today, you probably heard. Now, the press isn’t covering it very much, which is just incredible. Possibly our Defense Department or somebody. Anyway, it was leaked. The entire military plan of Israel. The military plan, the plans they have. At the highest level, it was leaked. Highly confidential information. It was leaked by our somebody. They have no idea who did it. Can you imagine you’re fighting a war and you have your Americans… Carlos, can you imagine anything like that? Did you hear this? They leaked all the information about the way that Israel is going to fight and how they’re going to fight and where they’re going to go. Somebody. Who did that? Can you imagine somebody doing that? That’s the enemy. I guess that maybe is the enemy from within, as I talked about. We have an enemy from within. They hate to talk about it. But could you imagine? Could you imagine?
(22:21)
So we just can’t stand for this incompetence anymore. We are an incompetently run country. We’re led by a man that, first of all, look, I’m not a fan of his. But what they did to him was incredible. He had 14 million votes. He won the primary fair and square. He had 14 million votes. And they came to him and they said he had a bad debate. He didn’t do well. And his numbers went down. But I think he would do, probably in the end, he might do better than her because she’s more incompetent than he is. I think she’s grossly incompetent. And I don’t want to be nice about it because we can’t take a chance. Nobody knows who she is. You say Harris. Her name is Harris. Who the hell is Harris? Even political people don’t know. Rick Scott has no idea who the hell Harris is. No, people don’t know who Harris is.
(23:13)
But now they’re finding out that she’s a radical-left lunatic. And we can’t take a chance on losing this election. Because if we lose this election, we may not have a country anymore. And I’ve heard this from a lot of very smart people that are very straight down the middle. They say, we may never have an election again in this country. This is where we’re going. I used to say that if we don’t do something… We all know what’s happened with Venezuela. This was, 20 years ago, one of the great countries of the world. And now it’s troubled, to put it mildly. And I said it would be Venezuela on steroids, meaning a bigger version. That can happen. Who would think it can happen? But I see it because I see the people that we deal with. And these people are, they don’t love our country. They don’t love our country. And we’re going to do something about it. But we have to win the election.
(24:10)
When they get up and they lie about every single thing, they tell you… They know your position. And in my case, it’s been my position for many years. One of the people said the other night on television, he’s a great guy, Jesse Waters, he said, “Whether you like Trump or not, his position has been the same for 30 years.” I mean, it’s been the same. I want strong borders. I don’t want foreign countries to rip us off, Max. We’re being ripped off by everybody, and our friends do it worse than our enemies. It’s incredible. We had that very well going, and we did a good job on that. But we’re going to do the ultimate job. We’re going to bring a lot of those jobs back. I think we’re going to bring more than we lost back. And it’s going to happen very fast through intelligent taxation, tariffs, and incentives. And you’re going to have companies pouring into our country, and they’re going to be very happy.
(25:05)
I think that’s why I’m doing so well in Michigan. That’s why the autoworkers like Trump so much. Their union head is a stiff. He’s a total stiff. He has no clue. He has no clue. He wants to go all-electric. They want to have all-electric cars. And they’re wonderful. I think they’re great. They have an application, but we want gasoline-propelled cars. We want hybrids. We don’t want hydrogen, Max, because they blow up, and you are no longer recognizable, Max. This guy owns more gas stations than any guy. He owns so many gas stations, he doesn’t know what to do with them, right? He’s a great American, too, by the way. He started with nothing, and he’s a very successful man. He’s a great man.
(25:49)
So I just want to thank you all. We can’t play games with these people. These are people that are dangerous people. And again, Hillary and Biden. Now, Biden didn’t tell the truth very much, but he was much better than this one. This one is just an outright… I’ve never seen anything like it. Point after point after point. And then they do ads, and they just say this stuff. And I just wonder, I hope the public is understanding it. I hope. Because I found the public to be amazingly smart. They get it. Really, I found it to be amazing that they get it. But the level of lying is just incredible. I mean, to a point where I can’t even imagine it’s legal.
(26:31)
I was asking some of these lawyers, some of the top guys, I said, “Can they absolutely, two weeks before an election, go out and do an ad where every one of your policies are the exact opposite?” Isn’t that election interference? And isn’t that fraud? Isn’t there a court that can do something about that? But the end result is, we can talk about it here, and people can listen, and they understand it. And I think they understand it. So maybe what we’ll do is we’ll go around, take a couple of questions, and have a little fun. Okay? It’s an honor to be with everybody, and especially this great Hispanic community. Right? Thank you very much.

Speaker 4 (27:11):

Mr. President, you know that the Latino community loves you, and it was such an honor to work for you at the White House all four years, and I got a front row seat of how much you cared about the Latino community, and you delivered results, and you didn’t pander to us. You gave us opportunity, and that’s what we want. We want the American dream. My mother was born in Mexico, my dad was born in Brooklyn, with very humble means, and they worked very hard and achieved the American dream. So that’s how a… In what other country could a little girl from East L.A. make it to the White House to work for President Trump?
(27:57)
And that dream is achievable through jobs, and we care, like all Americans, about the number one issue, and that’s jobs and the economy. We have some amazing business owners here, sir, that want to tell you about how it was under your administration and the trouble they’re having. And so we have Joel Garza, who’s here, who owns many Sonic franchises, among many other things. He’s an entrepreneur. And so, Joel, why don’t you tell the President and everybody here about what you’re experiencing?

Joel Garza (28:26):

Thank you, Mr. President-

Donald Trump (28:27):

Thank you.

Joel Garza (28:27):

… you have us here and taking the time to be with us today. It’s been the last three and a half years, the worst years for businesses. Inflation, interest rates with banks, prices, everything, everything. It’s nothing compared to 2017 to ’20, when you were at the White House. And my biggest issue is going to be, it’s easy to destroy what you build, but I don’t think it’s enough time for you in four years to rebuild again what these people destroyed. I live in the city of Houston. In the last two years, 30% increase in property taxes. And we got a great governor. Governor Abbott, he’s a great guy.

Donald Trump (29:16):

It’s true.

Joel Garza (29:16):

Great guy. But we need your help as soon as possible. We need you to help us with banks to stop regulations. It is just so difficult right now to create more jobs.

Donald Trump (29:28):

I think we’re going to get it going very quickly, actually. I think it’s a lot of time. And we have some very good foundation. We have, as an example, the tax bill that we passed. We gave you the biggest cut in taxes in the history of the country, bigger than the Reagan cuts. And all of that stuff, it’s going to be very hard for them to give it up. I can’t imagine politically that it would be possible. It would be a disaster for the country. That could lead to a depression, frankly, if they gave that up. But we have a great foundation to build on. And we’re going to have things. We’re going to have a lot of companies coming in very fast.
(30:03)
And I know your area does have some problems, incredibly. People don’t talk about that, but they do. But most areas have problems because the policies of this admin… They don’t even have a policy. They don’t have a policy. There’s nothing. They don’t have anything. They don’t know what they’re doing. I mean, think of it. They want to go to all electric cars. The whole thing, electric. They need $9 trillion, I read the other day, to do a charging station, Max. He owns the gasoline stuff. To do a charging station. And they built eight charging stations up in the Midwest someplace. They spent $9 billion. I kid you not. You know what that is? A charging station is like a gas pump. It’s the equivalent of a gas pump. They spent $9 billion for eight charging stations.
(31:04)
So if you look at it that way, if you did the whole country, you would have spent $30 trillion, which is more than the country… Which is every country in the world…. It’s so out of control. It’s so horrible. And they don’t want to change. The truckers came in to see me. The truckers are great. They have trucks that can go from New York to Los Angeles on a tank of diesel fuel. And they came in almost crying. They said, “These people are crazy.” They want us to go to electric trucks. And the problem is they don’t go far. They’d have to stop six times. I mean, you talk about no deliveries. They have to stop six times. They’re two and a half times heavier than gasoline or diesel. So the truck would weigh two and a half. I said, “Well, that could be a problem, right?” Yes, you’d have to rebuild every bridge in the United States because they can’t handle it. What do you think of that, Carlos? So now, if you’re a child, you’d say, okay, that doesn’t work. You know, those two things, right? It doesn’t go far.
(32:03)
And the other thing, third thing, is they’d have to use half of the capacity for the battery because the battery takes up tremendous amounts of room, much more than a load of diesel fuel, which is something. And by the way, even little things, I’ll give you a little boring facts. As the truck goes, the fuel gets lighter, the battery stays the same weight. So it’s massively heavy, and it takes up about 50% of the area that you’re supposed to use to transport things. So it doesn’t work. So normally what you do is say, all right, after about, would you say three minutes, Carlos? Three minutes, you’d say, okay, let’s get onto the… That doesn’t work. They say, “We don’t care. We want you to do it.” And these truckers are beside themselves. They’re going to be forced to do electric trucks. They’re not going to work. Maybe someday in the future. I don’t know. Maybe someday, but it’s possible it’ll never work because it’s so crazy.
(32:55)
But think of it. Just the weight or the distance, they don’t go far. The cost is astronomical. And these guys are going to be all put out of business. You’re not going to have any truckers. And they say, “We don’t care. Build it. That’s what we want. We want all electric trucks soon.” Like, you give them such a short period of time. These are big… One gentleman had 29,000 trucks. And he said to me, “You know, I’ve been buying trucks for 50 years, and every damn year, they got better and bigger and stronger and more efficient. Every single year. And then we build the cabs, and we build apartments at the back of those trucks. And I’ll tell you, sir, I know you like luxury. You’d be proud to live in one of those trucks.” See, I don’t know about that. I might be. Who knows? Who knows? And I think he meant it, actually. But he said, “You’d be proud.” In the cab, they built the place for them to sleep and stay. He said, “Some of those things are so beautiful.” But he said, “Every year, for 50 years, it got better. And if we had to go to electric, we would go back more than 50.” We’d go back to 60 years. It would be worse than the truck from 50 years ago. It doesn’t work. So what you say is, it doesn’t work. But they want to force it down your throat. Look at the case of Los Angeles and California. They have brownouts and blackouts all the time, and they want to go all-electric. They don’t have enough electric for themselves. They want to go all-electric with one of the worst governors. And, by the way, she, as the Attorney General, helped destroy the state of California. That’s Harris. She destroyed probably, maybe the best city in the world. I mean, San Francisco was one of the greatest cities. A friend of mine, Bob Tisch, used to say that it’s the best city that he’s ever been. He was in many cities, the great Bob Tisch. And he said San Francisco was the best city in the United States. And now it’s horrible.
(35:11)
I own property there, and it’s very costly every time I do this. But I don’t care because this is a much higher calling. I hurt the value of my property tremendously when I say this, but it’s almost unlivable now with the crime and all of the things that are happening. And the only thing I would disagree with you on is that the economy is very important. I actually think that the biggest thing is the border because the border is destroying our country. It’s destroying the state. I think the economy is bad, and it’s made really bad by the horrible inflation that was caused. The inflation is really the biggest problem. But I really believe that even the inflation… And that’s a country destroyer. It’s a country buster, they call it, inflation. But I really think that the biggest problem this country has is what they’ve allowed to happen

Donald Trump (36:00):

… to us on the border. They’ve allowed our country to be destroyed. They’re allowing thousands of murderers and drug dealers and terrorists and people from mental institutions. They’re emptying out their jails into our country. They’re emptying out their jails, and by the way, their crime rates all over the world are going down. They have many people now coming from the Congo in Africa. You think about South America, they’re emptying out their jails in the Congo and they’re delivering them to the border and they’re saying, congratulations, here’s America. And we have 21 million people at least over the last little while, and if they got in, they’re going to have open borders, 100%. Just like they tried to trick everybody, they tried to tighten it up a little bit because they have an election coming up. It didn’t work much, but they forgot to tell you that they continue to fly big, beautiful Boeing jets right over the border with hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants landing in the Midwest and other places. They forgot to stop those planes coming in. They thought they were going to put a little bit of a show on in the border and they could show something. They didn’t do it.
(37:15)
I think it’s the single biggest problem because our country is loaded up right now with murderers and with people and seriously ill people from mental institutions and those mental institutions are empty and those jails are becoming empty. And countries are down 60, 70 and 80% in crime, and we’re going through the roof with crime. When she said, no, the migrants don’t commit crime. These migrants, the criminals that they’re allowing in are tougher than any criminal there is. The only good thing about it is they make our criminals look like nice people. These are ruthless, horrible people. I’d like to ask Max to say a few words because he gets it from the standpoint of where he was born. He grew up in a system and I’ve seen him speak very beautifully on this subject of what’s happening to our country, Max.

Max (38:09):

Well, thank you, Mr. President, for being here. Last time you asked me to talk, I took everybody else’s time and you told me to shut up, so I’m going to make it very brief.

Donald Trump (38:20):

Yeah.

Max (38:21):

I just want to start by saying drill baby drill, because that is your motto. I am extremely confident without a doubt that the first day that we elect Mr. Donald J. Trump, our next president, the first day in office, I guarantee you he’ll solve half of the problems that we have.

Donald Trump (38:46):

True.

Max (38:47):

Most important, on November 5th the election is not about you and us. It’s about freedom and oppression. And this is the only man that I know that can handle that. This is the only man that has survived for the grace of God, things that we can never imagine, and he gets up and he says, fight, fight, fight. I happen to be honored today.

Audience (39:41):

Fight, fight, fight. Fight, fight, fight. Fight, fight, fight.

Max (39:41):

I am honored today by being surrounded by representatives of God on earth and we have to pray and I always will say, pray, pray, pray, but fight, fight, fight, because that’s exactly what we need to do. Praying itself is not going to do it. We need to pray and fight.
(39:59)
Now talking about the economy, this is very simple. You made us energy independent in just a flick of a finger.

Donald Trump (40:12):

That’s right.

Max (40:12):

You can do it again. Now here’s the problem. We have people running our country who are totally economic illiterate. These people have never had a job. These people have never run a business. These people have never signed the front of a check. Mr. Donald Trump has done all of that and he runs the country like a business because after all it’s a business. You cannot keep printing money that you don’t have to help people who hate you instead of taking care of your own neighbors here in America. That’s why he’ll make America great again. And when he makes America great again, he’ll make the whole world great again because we need to be strong enough to take care of our problem and then we can go and help the people who need help.
(40:59)
So thank you, Mr. President. Talking about the American dream. A young boy came to this country and he’s 13, didn’t even know the language, and one day he’s sitting in a panel hugging the best man, the President of the United States of America. Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart.

Donald Trump (41:16):

Thank you, Max. Thank you very much.

Speaker 4 (41:23):

Mr. President, and it’s a misnomer that Latinos want open borders. We want a secure border like all Americans. And we know what it leads to, Eduardo, who is the producer of Sound of Freedom, he has so much first-hand experience. Eduardo, why don’t you tell us about the movie and what we’re facing with the immigration that the President is talking about?

Eduardo Verástegui (41:50):

Well, first of all, thank you so much, Mr. President for your time. My name is Eduardo Verástegui and I am very grateful to this nation for opening the door to my dreams. This nation has been such an amazing blessing in my life. God bless America, God bless Mexico and God bless Hispanic America, and let’s make America and Mexico and Hispanic America great again together, pro-life again, healthy again and free again.
(42:23)
I met these heroes 10 years ago in Los Angeles, California, ex-Navy SEALs, ex-CIA agents, and they travel around the world undercover, rescuing children, and when they told me in details what they do in how they rescue these children, my eyes were open. I said, I’m a filmmaker. I want to make a movie about this because the first step to eradicate child trafficking is to raise awareness because if you don’t know that this problem exists how you can fix it. So I made a promise to God that I will dedicate my entire life to end child trafficking, to end child trafficking because God’s children are not for sale. Children are sacred.
(43:06)
I am very grateful with you, Mr. President, dear amigo, dear hermano, because of you hosting a private screening in your house, because of you endorsing Sound of Freedom, after that Sound of Freedom became the number one independent film in box office ever in history produced by a Mexican producer. Thank you for that. Thank you for the incredible hard work you’re doing. Thank you for putting the children first.
(43:44)
And that’s why it’s so important is for all the media for all Mexican Americans, Hispanic Americans to vote for President Trump, and I know we will win for the third time. For the third time. Yes. Yes. We will win for the third time, and that’s a fact. It’s not an opinion, it’s a fact because it’s true. Because it’s true. Look what is happening right now. Look what is happening right now with these evil people. Obama, Hillary, Kamala, Joe Biden, Sleepy Joe, all this team, there’s more than 300,000 children, over 300,000 children that they came through the border, they released them and we don’t know where they are. Kamala, where are the children? Kamala, where are the children?
(44:52)
These people, Kamala and Biden, they’re the biggest human traffickers in the history and everyone knows that, and that’s why I’m here to give my 100% to support my dear friend, President Donald Trump, and again, we will win for the third time. God bless you. God bless you, Mr. President.

Donald Trump (45:14):

Really nice. Thank you.

Eduardo Verástegui (45:15):

We need to put you in the White House back again. In the beautiful White House. You’re going to be in the beautiful White House again.

Donald Trump (45:22):

You bring up something that people don’t talk about, the press doesn’t talk about. I think if we were on the other side it would be one of the great scandals in history. It’s actually 325,000 children are missing, sex slaves, slaves or dead. One of those four things, slaves, sex slaves, missing or dead. And think of what 325,000, we say it’s a number, blah, blah, blah. I was talking to a reporter before I said 325,000. Oh, what else is new? He’s going like, let’s go to the next question. I’m saying to myself, can you believe it? A bad sort of a reporter, I told him he is. But think of it almost like let’s get on with the interview.
(46:14)
Think of what, 325,000… We have religious leaders up here, think of 325,000. How many times can you fill a nice big stadium like a Yankee Stadium with that 325,000? They’re missing. I think many of them are dead. Most of them possibly are dead. It’s so sad. Our country is so sad. And then you wake up to the news that we’ve given the entire Israeli game plan to the enemy. Who could imagine this? Who could imagine this? I would say Israel’s not too happy about that, right?
(46:53)
But with all of this together, added up, and I’m just so glad I bring it up and it doesn’t register, maybe it registered better the way you said it because you’re such passion the way you said that, we are missing during their regime… This stupid person, this stupid person that was the border czar. She was made the border czar. Now she said she wasn’t. She was the border czar for three and a half years, now whether she is or not, she was in charge of the border that’s loud and clear. She never once called the Border Patrol. The Border Patrol, by the way, five days ago endorsed me, which is something there not even really supposed to do. And in endorsing me, they gave it a full-throated endorsement and endorsed me, they said how horrible she is. It’s not easy for them to say that this is the vice president of the country. They work for the country. They said the worst that they’ve ever seen. They’re great people. They’re people that want to do their job. It’s easier not to do the job, probably just let the people walk right into our country. They want to do the job. They love the country. They’re incredible people. I’ve gotten to know them very well.
(48:10)
They said not one time the question was asked by the fake news, how many times did she call? Not one call was ever made to any of them by either Biden or Kamala. Not one call about the border. And I actually think it’s the biggest thing. We talk about the economy and we talk about inflation, let’s put them together, put them together, but there’s something about that border that’s just really, really evil. The drugs, the human trafficking, it’s not just people pouring, it’s the human trafficking and they trafficking women mostly. It’s mostly women, believe it or not. As much as we talk about the 325,000, but women still have the big edge. They traffic in women and children and they do it at levels that… By the way, four years ago, it’s always bad if you do one person, it’s bad, but this is 15 or 16 times the number. Nobody checks. Nobody does anything. You know how you check? You go and open the trunk of a car. They put them mostly in trunks of cars.

Eduardo Verástegui (49:14):

Little girls.

Donald Trump (49:15):

How would you like to be a woman, a little girl, a little boy in the trunk of a car. That’s how they find them. A lot of times they’re dead because of the heat. They drive through, by the time they get to the destination, they open the trunk and they’re dead, and this horrible incompetent person has allowed this to happen and never one time called anybody from the Border Patrol, they work for her and they work for him, and then they complain about a bill. It’s a phony deal. It’s a scam. There’s no bill. I never had a bill. All you have to do as president, wake him up and say, Joe, we need you to say close the border. That’s what I did.

Speaker 4 (49:54):

That’s right.

Donald Trump (49:55):

I just said, we’re closing the border. He keeps talking about they keep bringing up a phony bill. The bill was horrible. 2 million people are allowed and it was a horrible bill, stupid bill, but it has nothing to do. As president, it’s called extreme power, you have extreme power, you can just by the fact you say close the border and the border is closed. That’s it. Very, very simple. You don’t need all of this nonsense that they talked about.
(50:23)
But the truth is, for some reason, and I can’t figure it out, for some reason, they want open borders. Nobody’s been able to tell me why. I don’t think they can tell you why. They just want open borders. So we have to win the election. I’m so glad you brought up, you said 300, but the number’s actually 325. I’ll give you a number that’s really bad too. So the Border Patrol, because they’ve had it, they’ve never done this before. They released a list of criminals in our country and they really are tremendously good if you let them do the job like I let them do the job. We have 13,099, during their term they tried to say, oh, this is over 40 years now. This is during their three and a half year that they’ve been there.
(51:08)
13,099 murderers, these are murderers, these are people that were in prison and they’re murderers. Some are up for the death penalty, but some killed far more than one person. 13,099, it’s the exact number, every one of them has been released into the United States of America. Then you have the drug lords and the drug dealers, there are thousands of them. Then you have the traffickers, the human traffickers. These are people that largely were in jail, caught. Then you have the gang members, these are people that weren’t in jail, but they ruled the cities, they ruled the cities. The gangs, they ruled them. You don’t have them Christian Durell for the most part. If you did, you’d do something about it very quickly. We’re lucky. But these are gang members that are so violent. And you see it’s happening in Aurora, in Colorado where you have a governor who’s a radical left governor, who’s petrified of the whole situation.
(52:04)
And they have military style weapons, they have weapons that are of military quality. Somebody said it might be a step up. It’s called a supreme, military supreme. They have weapons and they’re taking over apartment complexes and everything. These gangs come from Venezuela largely. What’s happening to our country, it’s so crazy. Nobody would think it. I mean, you sit here and you’re just amazed as you speak you get angrier and angrier because it’s so simple and it’s so obvious and everyone knows it’s true and nobody does anything about it. All they think about is transgender operations. All they think about is we want men to play in women’s sports.
(52:46)
I’ve never met a person because I’m a sports guy, I’ve never met a person that came up to me and they say, we want men to play in women’s sports. Somehow they’re pushing it. Has anyone here ever met… I’ve been doing this a long time and I’ve been talking about this for a while because I’m ending it on day one. I’m ending it on day one. Despite a whole web of things we wouldn’t accept it, but we are going to just end it. But has anyone ever had anyone… I mean, you have all these great politicians up here, Carlos, has anyone come up to you and say, we insist on having men play in women’s sports? I saw a volleyball match this weekend where a man who transitioned, this is the way I’m very politically correct now because you lose in politics if you say slightly off. A man who transitioned into, congratulations, a woman, hit a ball. He was like four feet up in the air. He smashed the ball so hard that these young ladies that were all top players, they said, we’ve never seen anything. They hit her on the head and

Donald Trump (54:00):

But people have been very badly hurt in that sport. And in other sports, swimming, it’s ridiculous, the records are being broken by numbers that nobody’s even thought possible. The greatest is weightlifting. You see weightlifting records. Take a look at some of these records where a record that stood for 18 years and they put an 8th of an ounce and an 8th of an ounce, and these guys are walking in and breaking it. It’s so sick that you actually say they hate our country. But think, has anybody approached you and said, “We want to really fight hard, so that men can play in women’s sports?” I don’t think so.
(54:39)
So there’s a sickness going on in our country. We have to end the sickness. And we have to start because she’s a radical left. She was one of the leaders, the one I’m running against. You’re all running against somebody. But the one I’m running against, she was in favor of defund the police. She was one of the starters of defund. Now once you have that ideology, even for a week or a day, you shouldn’t be president because if you want defund the police, even for a day, you shouldn’t be president. And she was one of the leaders.

Speaker 4 (55:13):

Mr. President-

Donald Trump (55:14):

So I just want to leave it at that. Would anybody else like to say anything? Bob, would you like to say something?

Bob (55:22):

Sure, Mr. President,

Donald Trump (55:23):

Go ahead.

Bob (55:24):

Give a Latino a microphone and we’ll…

Donald Trump (55:26):

That’s all right, in your case.

Bob (55:29):

Mr. President, I can’t believe your courage, your fight. And I know why you’re doing this. You’re not doing it for anything, but because you love this country. You love us and we love you. And there’s a big day coming up, November 5th, it’s existential for this country.

Donald Trump (55:53):

Yeah.

Bob (55:53):

And there’s a day about 30 days later, 20-some days later, which is Thanksgiving. And I’m looking for the day where we can sit around the table and thank God that President Trump is the 47th president of the United States. He’s going to bring this country back. There’s a famous Cuban poet, Jose Marti, and he said, “There are those who are born to love and build, and others to hate and destroy.” You’re a builder, you’re a uniter, you’re courageous. You love and you create. Years ago, Elián González, his mother Elizabeth, brought him to these shores at six years old and for a opportunity, for the land of opportunity. We’ve become the land of exploitation.
(56:56)
They took him out. The family had fought to keep him in this country under pressure from Castro. They took him out, our DOJ took him out, Janet Reno. Mr. President, DOJ has not gotten much better since then, even under some Republican presidents. But to me, the three letter agencies is the fourth branch of government. This warfare that’s gone against you and it’s one of the ones that are taking this country away. But we had a day of protests. I was here, I was living in Florida at that time when Elliot was taken, and they expected that Miami would burn like other protests around the country by other groups.
(57:43)
But nothing happened. And why is that? Because the Cuban community, the Colombian community, the Venezuelan community had built Miami, and they built this country with the working class. And when you build, you don’t destroy.

Audience (58:03):

That’s right.

Bob (58:04):

The other side of loving and building and creating is hating and destroying, and dividing. And that’s what’s happened. We have become from the land of opportunity, the land of exploitation. And the exploiter in chief is Kamala Harris and this administration.

Audience (58:26):

Yeah.

Bob (58:27):

And I don’t say that to be… I say that as a Latino who’s fed up [Spanish 00:58:35] where enough abuse and enough exploitation. To talk about, because I was involved with Eduardo on the Sound of Freedom as the executive producer, and we stole it out of Disney who had no faith in it. They were going to [Spanish 00:58:50], they were going to put it away. But angels lifted it up and it became an incredible thing. And it lit a fire in me and our company to the awareness of child trafficking. Now last year, and I know this because we were involved in anti-trafficking. On April 26th, 2023, Tara Lee Rodas testified before Congress that the US is the middleman in this trafficking.
(59:20)
And I’ve been to Central America. Our kids are being bought for pennies on the dollar, and they’re sold. We know where they are. None of these sponsors that they’re handed off to have been vetted. They know that they’re being sold into slavery, into sex, into body parts, et cetera. And so, we are the middleman. We’re profiting off of this. And Mr. President, when you become president, we need to follow this money because it’s dark money. We’re exploiting our children. But something happened after Tara Lee Rodas, this was just last year, testified there were 85,000 children missing.
(01:00:05)
And Xavier Becerra, who’s head of HHS and Alejandro Mayorkas, he went to his group and said, “People, Henry Ford would be embarrassed by the lack of efficiency of bringing people in as commodities to be sold. We need to be more efficient.” And guess what happened? The inspector general of DHS, Department of Homeland Security under Mayorkas, they did this investigation this year. Less than a year later, were 325,000 children missing. And like the President said, also millions of people are trafficked and exploited. 70% are women, 25% are children. But we were so good. That’s the only thing we’ve been good at to tell you. This administration, the only thing they’ve been good at is growing the biggest industry in the world, which is human trafficking and drugs. That’s the only thing that… and for exploitation, for power, for money.
(01:01:07)
If you go to watch Aladdin, it’s a pretty cool theater play in Broadway. The genie says to Aladdin, “Never drink from the cup of money or power, you’ll never be satisfied.” But Kamala Harris was charged with looking for the root cause of trafficking and the border problem. The root cause, you know how she could find it? Look in the mirror.

Audience (01:01:38):

Yeah.

Bob (01:01:43):

If O.J. Simpson was alive, he’d still be looking for the killer of his wife. But this is the root cause. The root cause is greed and power. And we have a president who loves us, cares for us. So to me, that gives me great hope for the future of this country, that we have a president, a courageous president who has God’s hand on him, who turned his head at 6-11 in the afternoon on July 13th. God’s hand is on this man because he’s chosen to bring us back this greatness.

Donald Trump (01:02:36):

Thank you, Bob. Thank you for that.

Speaker 4 (01:02:37):

Mr. President, the other issue for Latinos is our faith. And you are the champion of people of faith. And so, we would like to end this, if you would allow us, with praying over you, if you would allow us. And I would like for Apostle Maldonado and for Pastor Ramiro, if you could start, and then Apostle, if you could finish and we will pray for you.

Bob (01:03:04):

Can we all get together?

Speaker 4 (01:03:05):

Yes. Do you mind, sir?

Donald Trump (01:03:07):

No. Not at all. Not at all.

Bob (01:03:07):

Let’s all get together.

Donald Trump (01:03:08):

Thank you.

Audience (01:03:08):

[inaudible 01:03:09]. Thanks, Mr. President.

Pastor Ramiro (01:03:24):

[inaudible 01:03:19] into the mic. Thank you, sir. Let’s all pray together. Heavenly Father, we humble ourselves before you and we believe Lord, that you are the answer for all the problems that we’re facing, that we can put our hope in you through Jesus and have hope again. Our faith can be built up again, that you can return to us the joy that is only from you. However, today Lord, we lift up the man that we believe you’ve put your hand upon to help restore America and bring America back to the place that honors you, to a place where we will not be kicked out for saying Christ the King or Jesus is Lord. Lord, we want all faiths to be respected, all faiths.
(01:04:27)
And we thank you that this is a man that does in fact respect all people of faith. So we ask, Lord, you would strengthen him. That you’d send your holy and warrior angels around him like we’ve seen evidenced already. But you’d continue, Lord, because we know that the blood of Jesus draws us near you. So we ask for that covering over him, that he would continue to hear your voice, that you would continue to order his steps and that he would help us to make America godly again.

Audience (01:05:06):

Amen.

Pastor Ramiro (01:05:06):

I pray these things in Jesus name. Amen.

Speaker 4 (01:05:09):

Apostle-

Speaker X (01:05:09):

Thank you.

Speaker 4 (01:05:11):

Let Apostle get in here.

Apostle Maldonado (01:05:16):

As I was talking yesterday in North Carolina, I mentioned the people the fact that this is not a war between the left and the right. This is a war between good and evil. So we can’t combat that. We can’t fight that in the natural. We need a spiritual weapons to fight it. So prayer is one of them. And I believe President Trump is here because there is a purpose. There’s a higher assignment for him to finish with his nation.
(01:05:52)
So we are going to pray prayer. The Bible says that let’s pray for the will of God to come. Meaning what’s the will of God? The Bible says God sets up Kings. He removes Kings. We’re going to pray for the will of God for him to be the next 47 president. Do you believe that?

Audience (01:06:15):

Yes.

Apostle Maldonado (01:06:16):

I want you to stretch your hands toward him. In the Old Testament, the prophets anointed the kings to become kings. So today, we’re going to do what the Bible says. We’re going to bring the will of God and we’re going to pray for President Trump to be the next president. So I want you to stretch your hand. And I want you to pray whatever you want to pray out loud, but let’s pray with all the heart.
(01:06:41)
Father, we thank you. We come to you and we lift up President Trump. Father, you protected him. You guarded him with a purpose for this time, at such a time as this. And we pray today, Father, as an apostle in this country, as a man of God in this country, I pray for the kingdom of God to come, for the will of God to come, and for you to establish your will upon his life. And Father, we anointed him today. We anointed him to be the next 47 president of the United State, to restore the biblical values. Father and I thank you today, you protected him. No weapon form against him shall prosper. And he will go to the White House, Father, to represent you and to do your will in your assignment.
(01:07:32)
I pray today that you will be done and we’ll be celebrating that you have put him as the next president. We give you the praise for your protection. And we pray for his family, we pray for every member of his family. You protected him, God, and to you be the glory. And today, we can declare freely, Father, freely Jesus is Lord over his life. In Jesus name. Amen. Amen.

Speaker 4 (01:08:06):

Thank you, Mr. president. I hope you can feel the Latino love. Thank you everybody.

[inaudible 00:00:01].

Donald Trump (00:01):

Yeah. And I want to thank Brian and all the people from the UAW and just autoworkers, frankly, UAW or not, just autoworkers. And they’re great autoworkers up here. This is where it all began. It all began, for the world, it all began right here.

Amer Ghalib (00:13):

Absolutely.

Donald Trump (00:14):

And then slowly but surely, and then actually rapidly it got taken away from us, like candy gets taken away from a baby. They take that candy away from a baby so easy, and that’s what they did to us. And a long time ago, I told a story where I was given the Man of the Year or something. I was given a big award and I came up and spoke, and I talked about how… This is long before I ran for politics. And by the way, the fake New York Times said it never happened. And then they found the event. They found it. Did you see that?

Brian (00:43):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (00:44):

And they said, “Well, it never happened. There was no such award given or there was no such event.” And fortunately, we found a newspaper article that talked about, I was up here. This is long before this, this is probably 18 or 19 years ago. And I came up and I talked about, “Don’t let them steal your jobs. Don’t let them steal your automobile factories.” But they did. I wasn’t involved. I was happily in the private sector. But this is much better. This is much more important for me, because we’re going to save America. We’re going to save the automobile industry, which wouldn’t have happened if we didn’t come along.

Brian (01:18):

Right.

Donald Trump (01:19):

I mean, think of it. If you have all these places building these plants with China’s money and other countries, I’m not looking to blame China. Other countries too. You don’t have a chance. You don’t have a chance. They were going to build a lot of different plants in Mexico and Canada. We have to watch Canada. But Mexico and Canada, all of a sudden you’re going to say, “What happened to our industry?” We’ll be bringing cars. You’ll be a parking lot for cars that are going to be sold in America. We’re not going to let that happen. We’re going to make the auto industry bigger and better and stronger than it’s ever been.

Audience (01:55):

Yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump (01:55):

And this community is such a big factor. I’m surprised you knew that, Brian. I’m very impressed with you.

Amer Ghalib (02:00):

Absolutely. Those are my co-workers.

Donald Trump (02:02):

Do you have a little Arab blood in you, by any chance?

Brian (02:07):

[inaudible 00:02:07], but these guys are good workers.

Donald Trump (02:08):

I know they are. They’re great people too, and they’re smart and that’s what we want. So it’s an honor to get your endorsement. It’s an honor to be here as we open up this beautiful facility. And I’m going to be seeing you a lot, Mr. Mayor. And I think there’s a hell of a future, don’t you think?

Audience (02:28):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (02:28):

[inaudible 00:02:28].

Amer Ghalib (02:28):

Mr. President, one thing that the Democrats keep sending to our community, is to scare them that you will come and deport them, although some of them are second and third generation immigrants. So I want you to respond to these accusations and fear delivering to our community. What would you say?

Audience (02:47):

Fake news.

Donald Trump (02:58):

Fake news. I’m going to be honest now, they say every week they have a different concept for me. I’m going to be the biggest dictator in the world. I’m going to destroy the world. I’m going to… They have so many things that they’ve said about me and nothing sticks. Is this the new one? I’m going to come and we’re going to deport… But just your community.

Amer Ghalib (03:14):

These are legal immigrants, all of them.

Donald Trump (03:16):

That’s good.

Brian (03:16):

They said [inaudible 00:03:18].

Donald Trump (03:18):

Well, and I’ll tell you what, they’re also great people and they’re great workers and [inaudible 00:03:27]. Thank you very much. It’s a tremendous honor to be with you. And now we’re going to go, we’re going to make two stops and we’re going to make a big speech. But this was a very important one. This is my first stop and this is in honor of the mayor, because in particular he and the [inaudible 00:03:36]. Thank you.

Amer Ghalib (03:40):

Mr. President, on behalf of the City of Hamtramck, and we would like to present you a certificate of appreciation for visiting our city. I would like to call the three elected officials, if you don’t mind, to join me to hand you this certificate, please. It’s going to be historic for our state.

Donald Trump (03:59):

[inaudible 00:04:25].

Speaker 2 (03:59):

President Trump, we’re proud to see you standing at the White House again.

Donald Trump (03:59):

Thank you. We’ll see you at the White House.

Audience (06:00):

Yeah, all right.

Donald Trump (06:00):

We’ll see you at the opening of these great auto factories that we’re going to build next yea. Thank you everybody.

Speaker 2 (06:00):

We just want to thank you. Our restaurants endorse all of you at MAGA.

Donald Trump (06:01):

Thank you. I heard that.

Speaker 2 (06:01):

[inaudible 00:04:54] restaurants.

Donald Trump (06:01):

How good are the restaurants? Is the food good or is it great?

Speaker 2 (06:01):

It’s great. [inaudible 00:06:01]. We are doing it for America.

Donald Trump (06:01):

Thank you.

Speaker 2 (06:01):

You are the only one that can make this America great again.

Donald Trump (06:01):

Thank you.

Speaker 2 (06:01):

My pleasure.

Donald Trump (06:01):

Thank you very much.

Speaker 2 (06:01):

Thank you so much for [inaudible 00:06:01].

Donald Trump (06:01):

I appreciate it greatly.

Speaker 2 (06:01):

Please come out and…

Donald Trump (06:01):

I will do that. I will. Thank you. Thank you everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you, my friend.

Speaker 3 (06:01):

Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump.

Audience (06:01):

Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump.

Amer Ghalib (06:01):

Have a seat. Have a seat everybody.

Speaker 4 (06:01):

Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump.

Audience (06:01):

USA, USA, USA, USA.

Speaker 4 (06:01):

Sir? Sir?

Amer Ghalib (06:05):

Thank you. Can you hear me now? Well, okay, so thank you all for joining us today. On behalf of Hamtramck residents and the Arab and American Muslims and the Muslim Americans here in the metro of Detroit, we welcome President Trump to have Hamtramck city. And we thank him for making this historic visit in possible. This is a small agenda, but we have a sample of community leaders and activists, not just from Hamtramck and business owners, of course, not just from Hamtramck, but from other cities including Detroit, Dearborn, Dearborn Heights, Marvindale, Warren. And so they’re all here for one goal and one mission, to send President Trump back to the White House.

Audience (17:50):

Yeah.

Amer Ghalib (17:50):

As you know, President Trump keeps saying that our country is in decline and the ship is sinking. So sometimes it’s wise enough to sail against the wave, so we can get to the shore safely under the leadership of President Trump. And that’s why I endorse President Trump in this area, in Wayne County, in Hamtramck. With your support we will send President Trump back to the White House.

Audience (18:25):

Yeah. President Trump, Trump ’24. Trump ’24.

Amer Ghalib (18:35):

Thank you.

Audience (18:36):

Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.

Amer Ghalib (18:41):

Thank you. So sometimes it’s very impactful and powerful to work with minorities like you guys. And with your support, we can see a major difference in the swinging states like Michigan. Our endorsement is an example of that. And it shook the world and it will make a big difference in Michigan. And hopefully, we will make President Trump the 47th president of the United States.

Audience (19:07):

We will. Right on.

Amer Ghalib (19:07):

Can you still hear me?

Audience (19:07):

Yes.

Amer Ghalib (19:19):

As a Yemeni immigrant and the son of a Yemeni immigrant in this area, which is heavily populated by Yemeni Americans here, I’m very proud to lead this community and to stand on the bright side of history this time. We had a history of disconnect and miscommunication with the Republican party, the party of common sense. Now, we are here to end that disconnect, that created misunderstanding and distrust and is stereotyping sometimes. But this is a new era now, and we are here to tell President Trump that the Yemeni American and the Arab Americans will contribute significantly to the development of the auto industry that he’s talking about these days.

Audience (20:14):

Yeah.

Amer Ghalib (20:20):

[inaudible 00:20:20] thousands and thousands for small businesses here and in New York and California and other states, and they contributed significantly to building this country. So President Trump realizes that, and he appreciated that. And his visit today, is to show respect and appreciation to our community. So we thank him for that. And remember this guy, I called him the man of principles.

Audience (20:46):

Yeah, Trump.

Amer Ghalib (20:47):

That he is the most transparent president in the history of the United States. The most decisive, frank, family and faith-oriented person. Remember when he talks about raising his kids, what does he say? He say, he taught them no drugs, no alcohol, no smoking, is it? Is it that one?

Audience (21:13):

Yeah.

Amer Ghalib (21:16):

[inaudible 00:21:16] how we want to be raised. So we thank him. We have so much in common now and we should focus on what unites us and rise above what divides us. So thank you guys for coming today. It is my honor and pleasure to introduce to you, the 45th president and hopefully, the 47th president of the United States.

Donald Trump (21:47):

It’s a great honor. And it’s great to be here at this opening. It’s an opening and it’s maybe an opening of more than just a building. I really believe it.

Audience (21:53):

That’s right.

Donald Trump (21:55):

And we all ultimately, want one thing. We want piece in the Middle East. We’re going to get peace in the Middle East.

Audience (21:59):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (22:03):

I think it’s going to happen very fast.

Audience (22:04):

We trust you.

Donald Trump (22:05):

It can happen with the right leadership in Washington. You have a woman running against me, she shouldn’t even be running against me. She hasn’t got the capability.

Audience (22:12):

Boo.

Donald Trump (22:14):

But you have a woman running that won’t get anything done. She’s wishy, she doesn’t know what to do. And she’s a very confused person. And I think I probably would take Biden over her. I have somebody, we were talking. The mayor, first of all, it’s an honor to be your friend and it’s an honor for that endorsement coming from you and a highly respected man, somebody that really is respected in the community and along beyond this community. A few people said, “Who is that guy? He’s really something?” I’ve got big plans for him, right? It really is, it’s a great honor. And I see somebody else, Mr. Mayor, if I could, in the audience. So United Auto Workers, so many of them as you know, support me, because I’m going to bring back the auto jobs.
(23:01)
Whereas unfortunately, the head of the union doesn’t have any clue. He doesn’t understand that the electric cars are going to drive everybody back to China and we’re not going to have that. And we want the jobs in your community. And you have tremendous numbers of auto workers in your community, which is something that I did not know, but I know now and I realize it. And somebody, they’ve written and they’ve called and we’re going to bring the companies back. If you go back 50, 60 years, we were the king and queen together of the auto industry. Now it’s been taken by China, Mexico, and so many other countries. We’re going to bring them all back. We’re going to bring all of those companies that left back through a series of very smart and not very expensive incentives. And we’re going to then protect them, so they don’t get ripped off and robbed, like everybody in our country has been over the last long period of time for many, many years. So I’d like to bring… Brian, would you come over here for a second?

Audience (23:59):

Brian.

Donald Trump (23:59):

This man, and I’ve seen him for a couple of years and I didn’t know who he was, but he was a Trump fan like I’ve never seen. And he wanted to get the United Auto Workers on our side. And he literally has 80%, a tremendous number of them on our side, because-

Brian (24:17):

70.

Donald Trump (24:20):

79.

Brian (24:21):

That’s pretty good.

Donald Trump (24:23):

It’s pretty good. I’d say it’s pretty good. But we have a tremendous amount of auto workers on our side. Many of the auto workers are in your community and a lot of them are really great, I hear, very Talented.

Brian (24:34):

Yeah, I worked with them.

Donald Trump (24:35):

Yeah, very talented. But I’d like you to say a few words about what we’re doing. And you missed the one meeting we had in Detroit, which was good. And I might say it here, because it’s important. So I’ve been saying that Mexico’s building two of the largest plants anywhere in the world and we’re just not going to let it. It would literally wipe out Michigan auto business. And that would go to South Carolina to a lesser extent, because of certain reasons. But South Carolina, Tennessee, others also could be, maybe completely knocked out. I don’t know. These are the biggest plants in the world. Somebody that I know very well is building them. And he told me about them a year ago and I told the mayor about them. I told Brian about them. We told a lot of people. And I’ve been talking about them now for over a year.
(25:21)
And I said, “If we’re going to allow Mexico to build these massive plants, you’re not going to have any jobs. They’re all going to be gone.”They go into Mexico, they can produce so many cars out of these very modern… You press a button and the whole plant opens up. They don’t have a lot of workers, but they have a lot of capacity. And so I’ve been talking about this now for a period of over a year. And I found out about it from a man who’s the biggest in the world at building auto plants. I think he’s building these two, in fact, I know he’s building these two. But one in particular, is just massive. And they were getting ready to start.
(25:55)
And when I was in Detroit last time, I saw the gentleman, who I hadn’t seen for a while. And I said, “Let me ask you, John, how are those plants coming?” “So they’ve been stopped. They’ve been stopped.” I said, “You mean the plants in Mexico?” Because I wanted to see a plant and I wanted to see one in the United States. He said, “Sir, we don’t make them in the United States the way they do elsewhere.”Now, these plants were owned by China and built in Mexico near our border. They were going to just build a car and just pour them in. And you wouldn’t have had any… Which Brian understood.

Brian (26:28):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (26:29):

And the mayor understood. You wouldn’t have any capacity. You wouldn’t have had any reason to be here and be making cars. So I heard about this and I hated it. And I talked about it for a year. It was in every speech I made on autos. And I came up three weeks ago. We spoke before the Economic Club, Detroit and I talked about it. And then I saw the gentleman in the audience and I said, “Could I speak to you for a second? How are those plants coming?” “Sir, they’ve been stopped.” I said, “What do you mean they’ve been stopped?” ” They think you’re going to be president and you’re going to charge tariffs and it will make it economically impossible to build them. So they stopped construction [inaudible 00:27:11].”

Audience (27:11):

Thanks to you.

Donald Trump (27:15):

So I didn’t even tell you that, Brian.

Brian (27:15):

I heard about it.

Donald Trump (27:15):

So what I’ve done, is I’ve saved Michigan, I think, because we’re going to reverse it. I’m going to go back to them, I’ll say build the plant in Detroit. Build the plant up here, build it in the state of Michigan. Or build it in the United States, we can handle that, right? As long as it’s in the United States. But let’s start over here. Maybe you make a deal and you will make a deal. I think you could make a deal right here. And we’ll end up having those plants built over here instead of built in other countries. Other countries.

Audience (27:43):

Yeah, right.

Donald Trump (27:43):

So this plant that I was talking about for the last year, year and a half is stopped, because they think I’m going to get elected. They know if I get elected, I’m not going to let them sell cars into our country in order to destroy the rest of Michigan. You had many times the number of cars being built many, many years ago. This was a different world. And you see the empty hulks all over the place. So we’re going to start that little project. We’re going to get to the people, they have plenty of money, but they don’t want to lose money. And they would’ve lost a lot of money, because I wasn’t going to let any car come into the United States and destroy the Michigan automobile business [inaudible 00:28:21]. Thank you. Brian’s here for you.

Audience (28:20):

Thank you.

Brian (28:26):

Thank you Mr. President. And you are exactly correct. I’ve been preaching it to my co-workers in the UAW. And more and more of them are understanding this. The president is right, and the mayor was right. I worked with a lot of Arab Americans, Muslims throughout at Ford. A lot of the people came from this community, Dearborn, Dearborn Heights, hardworking people, family people, that just wanted a good job and they wanted to live the American dream. Over 30 or 40 years, that’s been slipping away here in Detroit and we’ve watched it. It’s been painful. And EVs might’ve been the final nail in the for us. But President Trump has a strategy, unlike his opponent. He knows what he needs to do to stop it. And you already saw an example of it.
(29:15)
The company, I believe was Walbridge, am I correct? And they were going to build this massive plant down there just south of the border. And all the vehicles would’ve been built down there and they would’ve tried to ship them in. Just him talking about it… Teddy Roosevelt used to have a saying, “Walk softly, but carry a big stick.” Nobody’s got a bigger stick than this guy, right here. And when he starts waving it around people listen. The guy’s one of the best businessmen in the history of this country. We need to elect him president again. He’s won two elections, he’s got to win a third.

Audience (29:50):

Yeah.

Brian (29:50):

So Mr. Mayor, thank you for your excellent remarks. You are exactly correct about the people in this room and the people in this community. And I’m so proud of President Trump and so happy that he came here to reach out the hand of friendship, because somewhere we got off the path. And the Muslim community needs to understand this guy represents your values.

Audience (30:23):

All right, Brian.

Donald Trump (30:23):

Look at the arms of this guy. I don’t know, that’s got to be a lot of lifting. I don’t know. I think you have it naturally, [inaudible 00:30:31]. Well, I want to thank… And I’m really in particularly proud that you are here-

Brian (30:34):

My pleasure.

Donald Trump (30:35):

Because right from the beginning, you understood it, you got it. A lot of people don’t understand it and it’s easy to do. And I’m so happy that it happened before the election as opposed to after the election, because this is big news now. I don’t know if the fake news will cover it, but this is big news now. Think of it, the biggest plants in the world were going to be built and now they’ve stopped. And what that would do is really hurt America and it’ll devastate

Donald Trump (31:00):

… Michigan, so I’m glad you were able to hear it as soon as I got the information. And the information is solid, and we’re going to get those plants to be built, ideally right here, and we’re going to work on it very hard.
(31:12)
As far as the election is concerned, we’re doing very well. You see we’re up in the polls pretty substantially. They have a new thing, a new phenomena, and that’s gambling polls. They call it the Poly poll or something. I’ve never heard of the [inaudible 00:31:30]

Speaker 5 (31:29):

Polymarket.

Donald Trump (31:31):

Polymarket, and we’re, I guess at 64 to 38, 36, something like that. So that’s not bad. I don’t know what the hell it means, but it means that we’re doing pretty well. And we’re the 64, by the way, okay? Just, we don’t want to be the 38 or 36. So I just want to let the Mayor know. I want to let the council members know, the three council members. I appreciate it. We won’t forget it. Please, stand up.

Speaker 6 (31:56):

[inaudible 00:31:57]

Donald Trump (31:56):

Yeah, and I want to thank Brian and all the people from the UAW, and just auto workers, frankly. UAW or not, just auto workers. They’re great auto workers up here. This is where it all began. It all began for the world. It all began right here.

Speaker 5 (32:15):

Absolutely.

Donald Trump (32:16):

And then slowly but surely, and then actually rapidly, it got taken away from us, like candy gets taken away from a baby. They take that candy away from a baby so easy, and that’s what they did to us. And a long time ago, I told the story where I was giving the Man of the Year or something. I was given a big award, and I came up and spoke. This is all before I ran for politics. And by the way, the fake New York Times said it never happened, and then I found the event. I found it. Did you see that?

Speaker 5 (32:45):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (32:46):

And they said, “Well, it never happened. There was no such award given, or there was no such event.” And fortunately, we found a newspaper article that talked about I was up here. This was long before this. This was probably 18 or 19 years ago. And I came up, and I talked about, “Don’t let them steal your jobs. Don’t let them steal your automobile factories.” But they did. I wasn’t involved. I was happily in the private sector.
(33:12)
But this is much better. This is much more important for me because we’re going to save America. We’re going to save the automobile industry, which wouldn’t have happened if we didn’t come along. I mean, think of it, if you have all these places building these plants with China’s money and other country. I’m not looking to blame China. Other countries too. You don’t have a chance. You don’t have a chance.
(33:32)
They were going to build a lot of different plants in Mexico and Canada. We have to watch Canada. But Mexico and Canada, all of a sudden, you’re going to say, “What happened to our industry?” Because you’ll be a parking lot for cars that are going to be sold in America. We’re not going to let that happen. We’re going to make the auto industry bigger and better and stronger than it’s ever been before.
(33:52)
And this community is such a big factor. I’m surprised you knew that, Brian. I’m very impressed with you.

Speaker 5 (34:02):

Absolutely.

Donald Trump (34:04):

Do you have a little Arab blood in you?

Speaker 5 (34:06):

[inaudible 00:34:06] these guys are good workers.

Donald Trump (34:10):

I know they are, and they’re great people too, and they’re smart. And that’s what we want. So, it’s an honor to get your endorsement. It’s an honor to be here as we open up this beautiful facility, and I’m going to be seeing you a lot, Mr. Mayor. And I think he has a hell of a future, don’t you think? [inaudible 00:34:30]

Speaker 7 (34:29):

Mr. President, one thing that the Democrats keep sending to our community is to scare them, that you will come and deport them. Although some of them are second and third generation immigrants, so I want you to respond to these accusations and here delivering to our community. What would you say?

Speaker 8 (34:50):

Fake news, fake news.

Donald Trump (35:03):

Fake news. [inaudible 00:34:58] They say every week, they have a different concept for me. I’m going to be the biggest dictator in the world. I’m going to destroy the world. They have so many things that they’ve said about me, and nothing sticks. Is this the new one? I’m going to come, and we’re going to deport, but just your community.

Speaker 8 (35:16):

[inaudible 00:35:17] legal immigrants also.

Donald Trump (35:18):

That’s good. Well, and I’ll tell you what-

Speaker 9 (35:20):

[inaudible 00:35:20]

Donald Trump (35:20):

… they’re also great people. They’re great workers. [inaudible 00:35:22] It’s a tremendous honor to be with you. Now, we’re going to go. We’re going to make two stops, and we’re going to make a big speech, but this was a very important one. This is my first stop, and this is a honor of the Mayor because in particular, he [inaudible 00:35:38] thank you.

Speaker 8 (35:42):

Mr. President, we have of the City [inaudible 00:35:44] and we would like to present you a certificate of appreciation for visiting our city. And I would like to call the three elected officials, if you don’t mind, to join me, to hand you this certificate, please. It’s going to be historic for our city.

Speaker 10 (36:01):

[inaudible 00:36:21]

Speaker 11 (36:22):

President Trump [inaudible 00:36:25]

Speaker 12 (36:24):

We promise you, we’re going to be in the White House again.

Donald Trump (36:25):

Thank you. [inaudible 00:36:30] White House. [inaudible 00:36:33] at the opening of these great auto factories that we’re going to [inaudible 00:36:39] Thank you, everybody.

Speaker 12 (36:25):

We just want to thank you. Our restaurants endorsed all of you guys. [inaudible 00:36:48]

Donald Trump (36:25):

I heard that. Thank you.

Speaker 12 (36:25):

[inaudible 00:36:51]

Donald Trump (36:54):

How good are the restaurants?

Speaker 12 (36:55):

[inaudible 00:36:57]

Donald Trump (36:57):

Is the food good or is it great?

Speaker 12 (36:59):

[inaudible 00:36:59] we are doing it for [inaudible 00:37:11] you are the only one that can make this America great again.

Donald Trump (37:15):

Thank you very much.

Speaker 12 (37:15):

Thank you [inaudible 00:37:18]

Donald Trump (37:22):

Thank you, I appreciate it [inaudible 00:37:20] I will do that. I will. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you, my friend.

Amer Ghalib (37:54):

I was caller number five on a radio station.
(37:54)
Won a four day, three night beach vacation.
(37:56)
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama.
(38:12)
And I ain’t gotta see my ex-future-mother-in-law anymore.
(38:12)
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours.
(38:12)
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize.
(38:26)
When she heard about my newfound luck on that FM dial.
(38:29)
And it’s crazy how lately now it just seems to come in waves.
(38:37)
What I thought was gonna be the death of me was my saving grace.
(38:37)
It’s got me thinking that her leaving is the only logical reason.
(38:37)
That I got the last spot in the Hooters’ parking lot.
(38:37)
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart.
(38:37)
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call.
(38:37)
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle.
(38:37)
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes.
(38:37)
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf.
(38:37)
And I ain’t gotta see my ex-future-mother-in-law anymore.
(38:37)
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours.
(38:37)
When it rains it pours.
(38:37)
I’ve been on one hell of a redneck roll for three weeks now.
(39:46)
And it all started on the day that she walked out.
(39:52)
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket.
(39:52)
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it.
(40:04)
She swore they were a waste of time.
(40:05)
Oh, but she was wrong.
(40:05)
And I was caller number five on a radio station.
(40:14)
Won a four day, three night beach vacation.
(40:17)
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama.
(40:17)
And I ain’t gotta see my ex-future-mother-in-law anymore. Oh Lord, when it rains it pours.
(41:06)
When it rains it pours.
(41:07)
Ow. Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.
(41:07)
I’ve known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart.
(41:10)
But you’ve got being right down to an art.
(41:12)
You think you’re a genius, you drive me up the wall.
(41:16)
You’re a regular original, a know-it-all.
(41:16)
Oh-oh, you think you’re special.
(41:24)
Oh-oh, you think you’re something else.
(41:24)
Okay, so you’re a rocket scientist.
(41:33)
That don’t impress me much.
(41:34)
So you got the brains, but have you got the touch?.
(41:34)
Now, don’t get me wrong, yeah, I think you’re all right.
(41:38)
But that won’t keep me warm in the middle of the night.
(41:51)
That don’t impress me much.
(41:55)
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.
(42:01)
I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket.
(42:04)
And a comb up his sleeve, just in case.
(42:07)
And all that extra-hold gel in your hair oughta lock it.
(42:12)
Because heaven forbid it should fall outta place.
(42:20)
Oh, oh, you think you’re special.
(42:22)
Oh, oh, you think you’re something else.
(42:22)
Okay, so you’re Brad Pitt.
(42:27)
That don’t impress me much.
(42:29)
Oh, oh, ooh. So you got the looks, but have you got the touch?
(42:32)
Now, don’t get me wrong, yeah, I think you’re all right. But that won’t keep me warm in the middle of the night.
(43:08)
That don’t impress me much. Yeah.
(43:09)
You’re one of those guys who likes to shine his machine.
(43:09)
You make me take off my shoes before you let me get in.
(43:09)
I can’t believe you kiss your car good night.
(43:13)
Now, come on, baby, tell me, you must be joking, right?
(43:17)
Oh, oh, you think you’re something special.
(43:19)
Oh, oh, you think you’re something else.
(43:26)
Okay, so you’ve got a car.
(43:28)
That don’t impress me much. Oh, oh, ooh.
(43:32)
So you got the moves, but have you got the touch?
(43:33)
Now, don’t get me wrong, yeah, I think you’re all right.
(43:51)
But that won’t keep me warm in the middle of the night. That don’t impress me much.
(44:07)
That don’t impress me.
(44:07)
Oh, oh, no, you think you’re cool, but have you got the touch?
(44:08)
Now, now, don’t get me wrong, yeah, I think you’re all right.
(44:10)
But that won’t keep me warm on the long, cold, lonely night.
(44:10)
That don’t impress me much.
(44:10)
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.
(44:13)
Okay, so what do you think, you’re Elvis or something?
(44:17)
That don’t impress me much. Oh, no.
(44:17)
That don’t impress me much. Oh, no. Ow.
(44:17)
Yeah.
(44:17)
Windows down, country sound.
(44:17)
FM on the radio.
(44:17)
Just me and you and the man on the moon.
(44:17)
Cruising down some old back road. Now, baby don’t you look at me that way.
(45:38)
Because you know there’s only so much I can take.
(45:38)
Because you make me want to.
(45:38)
Pull this truck to the side of the road.
(45:38)
Slide on over, let me hold you close.
(45:38)
And tell you everything I’m thinking.
(45:38)
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall.
(45:38)
Get drunk on you with no alcohol.
(45:38)
If you don’t stop, I’m going to.
(45:39)
Girl you make me want to, yeah.
(45:39)
Well, you know better than to wear that dress.
(46:15)
It oughta be against the law.
(46:15)
Plain and simple, girl them dimples.
(46:18)
Know just how to turn me on.
(46:21)
Now, baby, don’t you look at me that way.
(46:21)
Because you know there’s only so much I can take.
(46:21)
Because you make me want to.
(46:21)
Pull this truck to the side of the road.
(46:21)
Slide on over, let me hold you close.
(46:21)
And tell you everything I’m thinking.
(46:21)
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall.
(46:21)
Get drunk on you with no alcohol.
(46:21)
If you don’t stop I’m going to.
(47:52)
Girl you make me want to.
(47:52)
You make me want to.
(47:52)
Wake up with you, in the bed of my truck.
(47:52)
And start over again when the sun comes up.
(47:52)
You make me want to.
(47:52)
Pull this truck to the side of the road.
(47:52)
Slide on over, let me hold you close.
(47:52)
And tell you everything I’m thinking.
(47:52)
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall.
(47:52)
Get drunk on you with no alcohol.
(47:52)

(47:52)
Get drunk on you with no alcohol.
(47:52)
If you don’t stop I’m going to.
(47:52)
Girl, you make me want to.
(47:58)
Yeah. Windows down, country sound. FM on the radio.
(48:42)
Dumb de de dumb, de de dumb de de dumb, de da da.
(48:42)
Dumb de de dumb, de de dumb de de dumb, de da da da da da.
(48:42)
Well, I walk into the room.
(48:58)
Passing out hundred dollar bills.
(49:00)
And it kills, and it thrills, like the horns on my Silverado grill.
(49:05)
And I buy the bar a double round of Crown.
(49:08)
And everybody’s getting down.
(49:10)
And this town, ain’t never gonna be the same.
(49:15)
Because I saddle up my horse.
(49:15)
And I ride into the city.
(49:15)
I make a lot of noise.
(49:15)
Because the girls they are so pretty.
(49:15)
Riding up and down Broadway.
(49:15)
On my old stud Leroy.
(49:15)
And the girls say, “Save a horse, ride a cowboy.”
(49:22)
Everybody says, ” Save a horse, ride a cowboy.”
(49:34)
Well, I don’t give a dang about nothing.
(49:34)
I’m singing and bling blinging.
(49:34)
While the girls are drinking.
(49:39)
Long necks down.
(49:47)
And I wouldn’t trade old Leroy.
(49:50)
Or my Chevrolet for your Escalade.
(49:52)
Or your freak parade.
(49:54)
I’m the only John Wayne left in this town.
(50:04)
When I saddle up my horse.
(50:04)
And I ride into the city.
(50:04)
I make a lot of noise.
(50:04)
Because the girls they are so pretty.
(50:04)
Riding up and down Broadway.
(50:04)
On my old stud Leroy.
(50:04)
And the girls say, “Save a horse, ride a cowboy.”
(50:04)
Everybody says, “Save a horse, ride a cowboy.”
(50:04)
Well, I’m a thoroughbred.
(50:41)
That’s what she said.
(50:42)
In the back of my truck bed.
(50:44)
As I was getting buzzed on suds.
(50:47)
Out on some back country road.
(50:49)
We were flying high, fine as wine.
(50:52)
Having ourselves a Big and Rich time.
(50:54)
And I was going just about as far as she’d let me go.
(50:58)
But her evaluation of my cowboy reputation.
(51:03)
Had me begging for salvation all night long.
(51:08)
So I took her out gigging frogs.
(51:10)
Introduced her to my old bird dog.
(51:13)
And sang her every Willie Nelson song I could think of.
(51:16)
And we made love.
(51:16)
And I saddled up my horse.
(51:16)
And I ride into the city.
(51:16)
I make a lot of noise.
(51:16)
Because the girls, they are so pretty.
(51:16)
Riding up and down Broadway.
(51:16)
On my old stud Leroy. And the girls say, “Save a horse, ride a cowboy.”
(51:35)
Everybody says, “Save a horse, ride a cowboy.”
(51:36)
What? What?
(51:36)
Save a horse ride a cowboy.
(51:36)
Everybody says, “Save a horse ride a cowboy.”
(51:54)
We used to chase that Chattanooga freight.
(51:57)
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet. Catch a little air when we cross the tracks.
(52:02)
Sipping on something from a paper sack.
(52:04)
You hang your shirt on that maple limb.
(52:07)
Slipping through the moon to the river bend.
(52:09)
Wasn’t very long I was jumping in, jumping in.
(52:13)
I guess I’m still doing now what I was doing then.
(52:17)
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey.
(52:17)
Burning going down, burning going down.
(52:18)
Chasing you like those goodbye taillights.
(52:34)
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town.
(52:39)
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon.
(52:43)
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rearview.
(52:44)
Hell, I’m laying here tonight holding someone new.
(52:52)
Still chasing you, still chasing you. You always used to talk about LA.
(53:06)
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe.
(53:09)
Well, you know I tried to track you down.
(53:10)
I only got as far as Guitar Town.
(53:16)
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know.
(53:20)
Well, you should know that I haven’t given up.
(53:24)
I’m just on your radio.
(53:44)
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey.
(53:44)
Burning going down, burning going down.
(53:44)
Chasing you like those goodbye taillights.
(53:44)
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town.
(54:37)
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon.
(54:40)
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rearview.
(54:40)
Hell, I’m laying here tonight holding someone new.
(54:40)
Still chasing you, still chasing you.
(54:53)
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey.
(54:53)
Burning going down, burning going down.
(54:53)
Chasing you like those goodbye taillights.
(54:53)
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town.
(54:53)
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon.
(54:53)
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rearview.
(54:53)
Hell, I’m laying here tonight holding someone new.
(54:53)
Still chasing you, still chasing you.
(54:53)
Still chasing you, still chasing you.
(54:53)
You swear that you’re staying single, next thing you know.
(55:25)
You meet a girl at a bar and next thing you know.
(55:29)
You get her laughing, it’s 2 AM.
(55:31)
You’re telling your buddies three months in.
(55:33)
That she ain’t moving in, the next thing you know.
(55:37)
There’s a U-Haul trailer, next thing you know.
(55:40)
Your old apartment is y’all’s new place.
(55:44)
There goes the carpet but the deer head stays.
(55:47)
Next thing you know.
(55:48)
You’re saving money like never before.
(55:50)
Just to spend it all at a jewelry store.
(55:51)
Getting down on one knee on her mama’s porch.
(55:57)
Just praying she don’t say, “No.”
(55:57)
Next thing you know.
(55:58)
Your best man gives a half-drunk speech.
(56:03)
And you’re sunburned on a honeymoon beach.
(56:06)
And your left hand’s getting used to that ring.
(56:08)
And there the next two or three years go.
(56:08)
Next thing you know.
(56:15)
You weren’t really trying, next thing you know.
(56:23)
There’s a test on the counter, next thing you know.
(56:27)
She’s standing there crying, nodding her head, “Yes.” You’re half excited, half scared to death.
(56:32)
Because next thing you know.
(56:34)
You’re wearing scrubs and a funny white hat.
(56:36)
And the doctor’s saying, “How you doing there, Dad?”
(56:39)
And nobody’s ever called you that.
(56:43)
And you take the drive home slow.
(56:43)
Next thing you know.
(56:46)
It’s first steps, first dates, first car.
(56:49)
It’s 11:01 wondering where they are.
(56:50)
You’re saying that USC’s too far.
(56:50)
It’s amazing how fast seventeen years go. Next thing you know.
(57:13)
Next thing you know.
(57:13)
Next thing you know.
(57:13)
You get to know your wife again.
(57:16)
And you’re more in love than you’ve ever been.
(57:19)
With a lot of years of remember when’s.
(57:22)
And still some down the road.
(57:26)
Because next thing you know.
(57:28)
You got a yard full of your kid’s kids.
(57:29)
And you take them to church, teach them to fish.
(57:34)
And you tell them stories every chance you get.
(57:36)
About how fast this life down here can go.
(57:41)
Next thing you know.
(57:42)
Next thing you know.
(57:42)
Next thing you know.
(57:42)
Next thing you know.
(58:25)
Who doesn’t know what I’m talking about. Who’s never left home, who’s never struck out.
(58:34)
To find a dream and a life of their own.
(58:38)
A place in the clouds, a foundation of stone.
(58:45)
Many precede and many will follow.
(58:52)
A young girl’s dream no longer hollow.
(58:56)
It takes the shape of a place out west.
(58:59)
But what it holds for her, she hasn’t yet guessed.
(59:04)
She needs wide open spaces.
(59:04)
Room to make her big mistakes.
(59:04)
She needs new faces.
(59:21)
She knows the high stakes.
(59:29)
She traveled this road as a child.
(59:34)
Wide-eyed and grinning, she never tired.
(59:39)
But now she won’t be coming back with the rest.
(59:44)
If these are life’s lessons, she’ll take this test.
(59:47)
She needs wide open spaces.
(59:47)
Room to make her big mistakes.
(59:47)
She needs new faces.
(59:47)
She knows the high stakes.
(59:47)
She knows the high stakes.
(59:47)
As her folks drive away, her dad yells, “Check the oil!”
(01:00:39)
Mom stares out the window and says, “I’m leaving my girl.”
(01:00:42)
She said, “It didn’t seem like that long ago.”
(01:00:48)
When she stood there and let her own folks know.
(01:00:51)
She needs wide open spaces.
(01:00:51)
Room to make her big mistakes.
(01:00:51)
She needs new faces.
(01:00:51)
She knows the high stakes.
(01:00:51)
She knows the highest stakes.
(01:00:51)
She knows the highest stakes.
(01:00:51)
Wide open spaces.
(01:00:51)
She knows the highest stakes.
(01:00:51)
She knows the highest stakes.
(01:00:51)
Wide open spaces.
(01:00:51)
We had a plan.

Amer Ghalib (01:02:02):

We had a plan, move out of this town, baby.
(01:02:06)
West to the sand, it’s all we talked about lately.
(01:02:06)
I’d pack the car, bring your guitar and Jane for smokin’.
(01:02:14)
First thing at dawn, you’d cue the songs and we’d get goin’.
(01:02:18)
But you weren’t home, waited on the porch for you.
(01:02:22)
Sat there alone, all throughout the morn.
(01:02:22)
Till I got a hunch down in my gut and snuck around the back. Empty cans, and I’ll be damned, your shit was never packed.
(01:02:34)
Did your boots stop working?
(01:02:36)
Did your truck break down?
(01:02:37)
Truck break down.
(01:02:37)
Did you burn through money?
(01:02:37)
Did your ex find out?
(01:02:41)
Ex find out.
(01:02:42)
Where there’s a will, then there’s a way.
(01:02:44)
And I’m damn sure you lost it.
(01:02:44)
Didn’t even say goodbye.
(01:02:49)
Just wish I knew what caused it.
(01:02:51)
Was the whiskey flowing?
(01:02:51)
Were you in a fight?
(01:02:51)
In a fight.
(01:02:51)
Did the nerves come get you?
(01:02:57)
What’s your alibi?
(01:02:57)
Alibi.
(01:02:57)
I made my way back to LA.
(01:02:57)
And that’s where you’ll be forgotten.
(01:02:57)
In forty years you’ll still be here.
(01:03:06)
Drunk, washed up in Austin.
(01:03:25)
A hell of bluff, you had me believing.
(01:03:29)
How many months did you plan on leaving?
(01:03:33)
What happened? Bad habits? Did you go back? Go batshit?
(01:03:35)
I loved you. How tragic. Oh-oh.
(01:03:35)
Did your boots stop working?
(01:03:43)
Did your truck break down?
(01:03:44)
Truck break down.
(01:03:44)
Did you burn through money?
(01:03:47)
Did your ex find out?
(01:03:49)
Ex find out.
(01:03:51)
Where there’s a will, then there’s a way.
(01:03:51)
And I’m damn sure you lost it.
(01:03:51)
Didn’t even say goodbye.
(01:03:56)
Just wish I knew what caused it.
(01:03:57)
Was the whiskey flowing?
(01:03:57)
Were you in a fight?
(01:03:57)
In a fight.
(01:03:57)
Did the nerves come get you?
(01:03:57)
What’s your alibi?
(01:03:57)
Alibi.
(01:03:57)
I made my way back to LA.
(01:03:57)
And that’s where you’ll be forgotten.
(01:03:57)
In forty years you’ll still be here.
(01:03:57)
Drunk, washed up in Austin.
(01:03:57)
Truck break down.
(01:03:57)
Did your ex find out?
(01:03:57)
Got a girl from the Southside, got braids in her hair.
(01:04:48)
First time I seen her walk by, man, I about fell up out my chair.
(01:04:53)
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks.
(01:04:58)
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats.
(01:05:02)
Body like a back road, driving with my eyes closed.
(01:05:03)
I know every curve like the back of my hand.
(01:05:04)
Doing 15 in a 30, I ain’t in no hurry.
(01:05:04)
Imma take it slow just as fast as I can.
(01:05:22)
The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don’t need no belt.
(01:05:25)
But I can turn them inside out, I don’t need no help. Yeah.
(01:05:34)
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet. Man!
(01:05:34)
And ain’t no curves like hers on them downtown streets.
(01:05:41)
Body like a back road, driving with my eyes closed.
(01:05:42)
I know every curve like the back of my hand.
(01:05:42)
Doing 15 in a 30, I ain’t in no hurry. Imma take it slow just as fast as I can.
(01:06:01)
Hey!
(01:06:01)
We’re out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds.
(01:06:16)
Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers.
(01:06:16)
On a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile.
(01:06:25)
Get there when we get there, every inch is a mile.
(01:06:29)
Body like a back road, driving with my eyes closed.
(01:06:29)
I know every curve like the back of my hand.
(01:06:29)
Doing 15 in a 30, I ain’t in no hurry.
(01:06:29)
Imma take it slow just as fast as I can.
(01:06:29)
Hey, hey!
(01:06:29)
Imma take it slow.
(01:06:29)
Hey, hey, hey!
(01:06:29)
Just as fast as I can.
(01:06:29)
Driving with my eyes closed.
(01:06:29)
Got braids in her hair.
(01:06:29)
Hey, hey!
(01:06:29)
Yeah.
(01:06:29)
Heading down south to the land of the pines.
(01:06:29)
I’m thumbing my way into North Caroline.
(01:06:29)
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights.
(01:07:46)
I made it down the coast in 17 hours.
(01:07:49)
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers.
(01:07:54)
And I’m a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight.
(01:07:55)
So, rock me, Mama, like a wagon wheel.
(01:07:59)
Rock me, Mama, any way you feel.
(01:08:04)
Hey, Mama, rock me.
(01:08:04)
Rock me, Mama, like the wind and the rain.
(01:08:04)
Rock me, Mama, like a southbound train.
(01:08:18)
Hey, Mama, rock me.
(01:08:19)
Running from the cold up in New England.
(01:08:41)
I was born to be a fiddler in an old-time string band.
(01:08:44)
My baby plays the guitar, I pick a banjo now.
(01:08:48)
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down.
(01:08:53)
Lost my money playing poker, so I had to leave town.
(01:08:57)
But I ain’t a-turning back to living that old life no more.
(01:09:03)
So, rock me, Mama, like a wagon wheel.
(01:09:04)
Rock me, Mama, any way you feel.
(01:09:10)
Hey, Mama, rock me.
(01:09:10)
Yeah, rock me, Mama, like the wind and the rain.
(01:09:20)
Rock me, Mama, like a southbound train.
(01:09:21)
Hey, Mama, rock me.
(01:09:21)
Walking to the south out of Roanoke. I caught a trucker out of Philly, had a nice long toke.
(01:10:02)
But he’s a-heading west from the Cumberland Gap.
(01:10:05)
To Johnson City, Tennessee.
(01:10:07)
I got to get a move on before the sun.
(01:10:11)
I hear my baby calling my name, and I know that she’s the only one.
(01:10:14)
And if I died in Raleigh, at least I will die free.
(01:10:14)
So, rock me, Mama, like a wagon wheel.
(01:10:25)
Rock me, Mama, any way you feel.
(01:10:27)
Hey, Mama, rock me.
(01:10:27)
Oh, rock me, Mama, like the wind and the rain.
(01:10:27)
Rock me, Mama, like a southbound train.

Hey.
(01:10:41)
Hey.
(01:10:41)
Mama, rock me.
(01:10:41)
Oh. So, rock me, Mama, like a wagon wheel.
(01:10:41)
Rock me, Mama, any way you feel.
(01:10:41)
Oh, I want to feel.
(01:10:41)
Hey.
(01:10:41)
Hey.
(01:10:41)
Mama, rock me.
(01:10:41)
Mam, rock me.
(01:10:41)
Mama, rock me.

You can rock me.
(01:10:41)
Rock me.

Speaker 13 (01:11:55):

Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming your panelists from the Metro Detroit community. And here are your panelists, Howard Lutnick, Florida Congressman Byron Donalds.

Speaker 14 (01:12:18):

Yeah!

Speaker 13 (01:12:18):

Your US Senate candidate, Mike Rogers.

Amer Ghalib (01:12:25):

It was right after senior year.
(01:12:25)
Just before the summer disappeared.
(01:12:26)
We went a-riding them old farm…

Speaker 13 (01:12:34):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next President of the United States, President Donald J. Trump.

Amer Ghalib (01:12:46):

And I’m proud to be an American.
(01:12:46)
Where at least I know I’m free.
(01:12:46)
And I won’t forget the men who died.
(01:12:46)
Who gave that right to me.
(01:12:46)
And I’d gladly stand up next to you.
(01:12:46)
And defend her still today.
(01:12:46)
‘Cause there ain’t no doubt I love this land.
(01:13:11)
God bless the USA.
(01:13:26)
From the lakes of Minnesota.
(01:13:29)
To the hills of Tennessee.
(01:13:33)
Across the plains of Texas.
(01:13:36)
From sea to shining sea.
(01:13:38)
From Detroit down to Houston.
(01:13:41)
And New York to LA.
(01:13:41)
Where’s there’s pride in every American heart.
(01:13:49)
And it’s time we stand and say…

Byron Donalds (01:14:08):

Well, listen, this is a great, great, great crowd. Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Congressman Byron Donalds. I have the pleasure of representing the State of Florida. But it is my pleasure to make sure everybody is welcomed to Engineering Design Services right here in Metro Detroit. And we are going to have a fantastic round table with citizens of Metro Detroit. We’re going to be talking about the policies and the issues that have really hurt the American people from the Kamala Harris-Joe Biden administration. And the guest of honor, the man of the hour, the next President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, will be with us.

Donald J. Trump (01:15:06):

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Well, it’s an honor to be with you. We’re doing very well in the polls, as you’ve probably heard. They’re getting very big numbers, Byron. They’re getting much bigger than even anticipated. So, I don’t know what that means. That’s a poll in itself. But the early voting seems to be even far bigger than we thought, and we had great expectations. People are not loving her, and why should she? She didn’t show up for the big Catholic event. This hasn’t happened in decades. She didn’t show up. She gave a very short tape, and it was not an appropriate tape either, but she probably hasn’t figured that out yet. And we should have gotten about 100% of the Catholic vote last night because I showed up. But I think we’re doing very well, and we’re going to find out very soon.
(01:16:04)
And what I’d like to do is maybe before saying anything, I’ll finalize it out, but maybe we can go through the folks, and we can see what they have to say and how you’ve been doing. And I know one thing. Everybody did better four and five and six years ago than they’re doing now. That’s one thing. That’s one thing I know. So, why don’t we do that? And then we can maybe say a few words. You have a great gentleman running for the Senate. He’s been a friend of mine for a long time, and he’s a very talented guy. It’s not easy. To win these things, it is not easy. But he’s doing a great job. I hear he’s taking a lead. We’ll see what happens. But I hear he’s taking a lead.
(01:16:46)
So Mike, we’ll talk in a couple of minutes. How about we’ll go through it pretty quick, Dale? And then I’m going over to make a little speech in front of 10,000 people. You think this is an easy life I have, right? I go from here, I say, “Am I finished?” They say, “No, sir, you have one more speech.” “Oh, good. Where is it?” What is it, 20 minutes, 30 minutes away? Is anybody going? We’ll get you and 10,000 people. So Dale, go ahead, please. Thank you.

Byron Donalds (01:17:14):

Dale, take it away.

Donald J. Trump (01:17:15):

You’re looking good, Dale. Look at the arms on this guy. He’s almost as bad as my friend over here.

Byron Donalds (01:17:17):

Well, Mr. President, real quick, one thing. Before Dale begins, understand Dale’s a third generation union worker, dedicated Teamster car hauler.

Donald J. Trump (01:17:26):

Wow. Really?

Byron Donalds (01:17:26):

So, I know Dale has a lot of concerns about the auto industry. So Dale, please.

Donald J. Trump (01:17:37):

A healthy-looking guy, too.

Byron Donalds (01:17:38):

Go right ahead.

Dale (01:17:39):

This way?

Byron Donalds (01:17:39):

Yes, sir.

Dale (01:17:41):

I believe Donald Trump will protect the Michigan auto industry. He will end the Harris electric vehicle mandate that has crippled the Michigan auto industry. Oh, sorry.

Speaker 15 (01:17:55):

Oh, here we go.

Dale (01:17:56):

There you go. Yeah. He has plans to impose 200% tariffs on all auto companies that want to ship our jobs out of the country. He will save our jobs. He will put American workers first. I don’t know if you know, I don’t know if you heard, but us Teamsters here in Michigan love Donald J. Trump.

Donald J. Trump (01:18:21):

Thank you.

Dale (01:18:29):

We voted, and the results are loud and clear. Michigan Teamsters voted 62% Trump, 35% Harris.

Speaker 16 (01:18:39):

Wow.

Donald J. Trump (01:18:39):

Thank you, Dale.

Byron Donalds (01:18:39):

That’s great. Really great.

Dale (01:18:43):

President Trump, the Teamsters I work with have a message for you. They’re voting for you because they know you’ll fight. You’ll fight and save their jobs, fight and save America, never back down, never surrender. Fight, fight, fight!

Donald J. Trump (01:19:03):

Well, Dale, thank you. And I just want to say, you know Sean O’Brien, right? Sean O’Brien, head of the Teamsters.

Dale (01:19:07):

Yes.

Donald J. Trump (01:19:07):

He’s a great guy. They took a vote nationally, and I won by similar numbers nationally. And that’s an honor. I mean, that’s really an honor. I think it’s been many decades before they endorsed a Republican. I think they’ll start very soon. But we had rank and file Teamsters all over the country by numbers similar to that.
(01:19:26)
And I have some good news for you on the automobile business in Michigan. I’ll wait till we finish up, maybe, and talk about it, because you were going to have a lot of competition in Mexico, and that competition’s not going to happen anymore. But I want to thank you. I want thank the Teamsters also. I see another guy over there with that shirt. I can’t miss him, right? Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

Dale (01:19:46):

I work with the guy.

Donald J. Trump (01:19:46):

Oh, you do, eh?

Dale (01:19:46):

Yes.

Donald J. Trump (01:19:48):

Is he easy to work for or tough?

Dale (01:19:50):

You see my grandbaby too?

Donald J. Trump (01:19:51):

Oh, wow. Wow. Well, that’s good genes.

Dale (01:19:55):

I got my little girl there, too, and [inaudible 01:19:56]-

Donald J. Trump (01:19:55):

That’s good genes, I can tell you. I look at him. You got the best. Thank you very much. Thanks, Dale. Appreciate it.

Dale (01:20:03):

Thank you.

Donald J. Trump (01:20:03):

Thanks.

Byron Donalds (01:20:05):

Mr. President, we also have with us your great friend Howard Lutnick, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald.

Donald J. Trump (01:20:10):

That’s true.

Byron Donalds (01:20:11):

Howard, based upon the last question, what are your thoughts about what we can do to reverse course in the auto industry, save it, bring those jobs back here in America?

Howard Lutnick (01:20:20):

So for those of you who remember, my firm is Cantor Fitzgerald, and we were located on the 101st to the 105th floors of the World Trade Center. So, I lost my brother, Gary. I lost my best friend. I lost 658 people that day. And so, I understand what it means to have jihad, right? And there’s a big difference between jihad and wonderful Muslim workers in Michigan. They are not the same thing. We need to crush jihad from this Earth, and we need Donald J. Trump to do it.

Donald J. Trump (01:21:03):

Thank you.

Howard Lutnick (01:21:06):

So my friend, the President, said the other day, the tariffs are his favorite word in the dictionary.

Donald J. Trump (01:21:14):

My all-time favorite.

Howard Lutnick (01:21:16):

What people should understand is that to protect… So, what happened when Bill Clinton left office, he did NAFTA, which was another word to say, gut Michigan, right? He let all the work go to Mexico, right? And he opened the door and a different kind of border opening. It was a work border opening. And so the tariff model is pretty simple. Lock that door.

Speaker 17 (01:21:48):

Come on!

Howard Lutnick (01:21:49):

Bring it back here. Bring the jobs here. Bring the factories here. So, here’s an idea for you that we’ve talked about. Set significant tariffs out there. And if you open your factory here within two years, we’ll give you the credit for your tariff. But bring it here. Let’s employ our workers here. Let’s create power from our workers who are the best. They are the core of America, right?
(01:22:24)
So, when I first met Donald Trump, I didn’t really understand tariffs, and he taught me. And now I’m just trying, right behind them, to say, I love the way tariffs take care of America. They will build us. They’ll build us stronger. And I run his transition. And so, what does transition mean? That means when my friend becomes the 47th President of the United States of America, I promise you, the greatest field of people ever to walk into a government is going to join him on January 20th.
(01:23:11)
I have the best business leaders in the country, the best politicians who want to serve the crowd amongst the 80 million Republicans, that we can have the best of the best join him to create the most extraordinary government you have ever seen to protect you and to build the America that he wants to build. They will be loyal to him. They will have fidelity to him. They will follow his policies. And this will be the most extraordinary government you’ve ever seen. And I am the proudest person to serve Donald J. Trump and help him be the 47th President of the United States of America.

Donald J. Trump (01:23:46):

Thank you. Let me just say one thing about Howard. Well, thank you very much, Howard. He’s being very modest, I have to tell you. This guy is one of the leaders on Wall Street, one of the most respected people in all of business. And certainly, all of Wall Street, there’s nobody really like him. And he’s being very modest. On that horrible day, he lost his entire firm, other than some people in Europe, a few, small group. And he saw it happen. He was driving down the West Side Highway.
(01:24:25)
And he’s always in the office at six o’clock in the morning, so he would’ve been there. This was at eight o’clock. But his wife was just so angry at him because she wanted him to take their child to school, because he just doesn’t do it, and he won’t do it, and he hasn’t done it for years. And this was the one day that he wasn’t there at six o’clock in the morning because he took his child to school. And at about 8:50, which is just as the plane was striking, he was driving down the highway looking at the World Trade Center. This was the only day in years that he wasn’t in that building. And do you ever thank your wife? And do you ever thank your child? But it was amazing. There are miracles in life. We have miracles, and we have help up there, Howard, in my opinion.

Howard Lutnick (01:25:13):

You and me together, baby. You and me together.

Donald J. Trump (01:25:15):

In my opinion. But just the end of that. So I mean, you saw this, they had the top three floors, the top. A great firm, and just, they couldn’t get out. There was no way they were getting out. Some of the people were calling their wives, their family. I think you were speaking to your brother, right?

Howard Lutnick (01:25:32):

Yeah, my sister spoke to my brother, said goodbye.

Donald J. Trump (01:25:33):

Yes, speaking to your brother up there. They knew. They probably knew it was the end. And Howard sought to rebuild the firm. And he spent a lot of time, a lot of everything, a lot of effort. Most people would’ve said it was an impossible thing to do. And he rebuilt it bigger, better, stronger. But the big thing is he gave a big chunk of it, for a long period of time, to the families of those that died in the building. And who would do that? Who would do that?
(01:26:09)
And so he rebuilt Cantor Fitzgerald into something bigger than it was, which was pretty hard to do. And there are a lot of people that love this guy. He’s a special guy, a real talent, by the way. Real talent, a brilliant business talent. So he is, he’s in charge with a couple of other people we have that are great, working along with him, but he’s in charge of that whole transition process, which is a very important process. I love these exploding mics. Huh, do you? No, it’s good for emphasis. It explodes every time.

Speaker 18 (01:26:41):

It hits the ground.

Donald J. Trump (01:26:42):

Yeah, right. It explodes every time you’re about to make an important point. So, it’s okay. It’s not bad. No. Normally, I say, “Don’t pay the guy that supplied the mics,” but we’ll pay. And then they say, “Trump doesn’t want to pay.” But it’s one of those things. But I just want to thank you for doing a great job, Howard. You really have. And we’ll get on, and perhaps we can ask Nancy. How are we doing?

Nancy Jaafar (01:27:07):

Good.

Donald J. Trump (01:27:07):

Thank you.

Nancy Jaafar (01:27:07):

Thank you for having me.

Donald J. Trump (01:27:07):

Good, thank you.

Nancy Jaafar (01:27:08):

My name is Nancy Jaafar. I’m a Lebanese American Muslim entrepreneur.

Donald J. Trump (01:27:12):

Good.

Nancy Jaafar (01:27:13):

I am a psychologist and a holistic wellness practitioner.

Donald J. Trump (01:27:17):

Good.

Nancy Jaafar (01:27:18):

I own a wellness center in Dearborn, Michigan. It’s called Evolution Empowerment. And I’m not really here to talk about the economy because with that regard, I have utter faith in you, and you’re golden to me.

Donald J. Trump (01:27:31):

Oh, thank you.

Nancy Jaafar (01:27:36):

You’re welcome. What I am here to discuss is the health crisis. And it is exactly that. It’s really a crisis in this country. We are the sickest population in the world. We find it status quo that we spend more money on healthcare than any other country.

Donald J. Trump (01:27:52):

Right.

Nancy Jaafar (01:27:53):

So, we have a system that is looking to obtain lifelong consumers. We’re not really looking for cure or healing, and that’s very concerning to me. Before I became a holistic practitioner, I was a school psychologist, and I worked for the public schools for over a decade. And I was constantly frustrated with the incessant over-diagnosis, and over-medicating, and over-labeling of small children. I don’t know another country that finds it appropriate to give a five-year-old three different pharmaceutical drugs, including an antipsychotic.

Donald J. Trump (01:28:27):

Yeah.

Nancy Jaafar (01:28:27):

And this is to manage misbehavior. They are not looking for root cause. We’re not looking for toxicity. We’re not looking for gut health issues, or fluoride, or food, or diet, and then getting into the food itself. I mean, we ingest poison. Countries all over the world would never accept their citizens to ingest what we take in every day and what our children take in every day.

Donald J. Trump (01:28:58):

You must love Bobby Kennedy, right?

Nancy Jaafar (01:29:00):

I do.

Byron Donalds (01:29:00):

She does.

Donald J. Trump (01:29:00):

I think so. You sound like Bobby Kennedy to me.

Nancy Jaafar (01:29:08):

And the thing that I think is even more concerning is that we are inundated with these endocrine disrupting chemicals, and they have these long-term detrimental effects on the reproductive system of both men and women. Fertility rates are down, sperm is lower than it’s ever been. It’s terrifying to me, honestly. And my purpose is to constantly use every single opportunity to raise awareness about these topics-

Donald J. Trump (01:29:33):

Great.

Nancy Jaafar (01:29:33):

… and to hold our agencies accountable for the fact that we put them in place to protect us, not to harm us. So, I also have a purpose to let people know that you don’t need to take a narcotic every time you feel a little pain, or that you don’t need to be on three different antidepressants or antianxiety medications to mask a mental health symptom, and certainly to let parents know that it is not okay for birth control to be the first line of defense when your daughter has acne, when your 14-year-old daughter has acne. I find our system archaic. I think it is toxic and it’s corrupt, frankly. And what hurts me the most is that people who are out here giving Americans an opportunity to think differently and try natural routes are the ones that are being relentlessly censored. I see miracles, honestly, at my center every day. People heal rapidly before my eyes with no side effects, but nobody is talking about that because the choke hold that big pharma has and big agriculture has on us is criminal, and it needs to stop.

Byron Donalds (01:30:44):

Nancy, thank you. Thank you so much, Nancy.

Nancy Jaafar (01:30:48):

So, when I heard about Robert Kennedy and Make America Healthy Again, I felt a glimmer of hope that I haven’t felt in a very long time. I have to say I am genuinely terrified for humanity in general. The world needs healing, and I can only hope that you and your campaign are the catalyst for that because I know for sure the other team is not.

Byron Donalds (01:31:08):

That’s right.

Donald J. Trump (01:31:12):

Thank you very much.

Nancy Jaafar (01:31:12):

Thank you.

Donald J. Trump (01:31:12):

And I think you should actually set up a meeting with Bobby Kennedy and the whole group-

Howard Lutnick (01:31:18):

I can do it.

Donald J. Trump (01:31:18):

… because I see you’re into it. You have the same fervor that he has, and so I think it’d be maybe-

Nancy Jaafar (01:31:24):

Thank you.

Donald J. Trump (01:31:25):

… very interesting-

Nancy Jaafar (01:31:25):

I would love that.

Donald J. Trump (01:31:26):

… for all of you. Okay? Thank you very much.

Nancy Jaafar (01:31:27):

Thank you.

Byron Donalds (01:31:27):

Thank you.

Donald J. Trump (01:31:27):

Byron.

Byron Donalds (01:31:34):

Mr. President, we have with us Jim Tignanelli. I got it right, didn’t I, Jim?

Jim Tignanelli (01:31:38):

Yes, sir.

Byron Donalds (01:31:38):

Yes, sir. Jim is the president of the Police Officers Association right here in Michigan. He’s been in law enforcement here for decades. Jim, tell us about your concerns about public safety, not just here in Michigan, and tell us also about what it really means to have support for police officers and when that support is not here, how it demoralizes the police force.

Jim Tignanelli (01:32:02):

Thank you, Congressman. It’s a pleasure to be with you, sir.

Donald J. Trump (01:32:04):

Thank you. Jim.

Jim Tignanelli (01:32:06):

As you know, we’ve been endorsing you every time.

Donald J. Trump (01:32:07):

That’s right.

Jim Tignanelli (01:32:08):

And we’ll continue to, and we’ll never be out of your corner.

Donald J. Trump (01:32:10):

You have. Thank you.

Jim Tignanelli (01:32:12):

We represent about 13,000 police officers in Michigan. It’s about three quarters of the group. And I don’t know anybody here that would want to live, or invest, or work in a town where they’re not safe. So, no matter what you do money-wise, no matter what you do with everything else in your life, if you don’t feel safe, you’re not going to want to go to the restaurant. You’re not going to want to pump gas in your own car.
(01:32:35)
And our job, the open borders has been an issue with this, and we’ve talked about this a little before, but what’s happened is the honor and luster that came with the badge, the people that wore the badge, I’ll go back to the Old West, the badge meant something. When people saw it, it meant something. And it did even when I was on the job still pushing a car around. And that luster has tarnished. And to get the shine back

Jim Tignanelli (01:33:00):

-back is a lot harder than it is to lose it. Here in Michigan, we have 700 fewer police officers than we had in 2020. And that’s a significant number, when you look at. It means everybody’s working more hours mandated over time and such. But the worst part of that is our academies that once had a waiting list are now empty or half full at best. And our best recruits, I was with some high school students the other day, the best recruits we have for police, it’s a different kind of a job. It’s a culture, I call it. It’s not for everyone. Everyone here shouldn’t want to be a police officer. We don’t want you all to be police officers to be honest with you.
(01:33:39)
But the truth is, when we go to high schools, just like the military, the kids that we need are not 28 years old. They’re 16, 17 years old. And our best recruiters over the years were their senior officers, their dad, their uncle, their grandpa who are now telling them, you’re out of your mind, don’t do it. We have no retirement healthcare. So if they retire at 55, they’re on their own until 65 when Medicare kicks in. They have no pensions anymore. They get a 401k, but I don’t know how long you’re going to live. That’s not a real way to retire at 55. And it’s really not wages that’s killing our recruiting. It’s the pensions, it’s the healthcare. But it’s that desire to become one, the desire to become a police officer.
(01:34:28)
The open border, what it really did was take the old stop police thing that we used to be able to get away with and just vaporized it. Nobody stops at the border. They don’t stop on Gratiot Avenue. They won’t stop out here on Adams Road either. And so what’s occurred this year, in 90 days we had three police officers shot to death on the job, separate incidents. Not one of them had their gun out of their holster. These weren’t barricaded gunmen, wasn’t a bank robbery. These were ambushes. That’s in Michigan, three in 90 days. And they never fired a shot, never got their guns out.
(01:35:04)
So I like to borrow an old line, maybe J.D Vance would like it, but it’s an old Marine. Chesty Puller once said, “We’ve located the enemy. They have us surrounded.” That’s how I feel right now. They got us surrounded. But when we see you at a funeral, when we see you writing letters, when we see you hugging babies of fallen officers, I just want you to know that we feel like our arms are around those people. And I can’t begin to tell you how much that means to us. The things that you do. We’ve got right now, 16 officers indicted for felonies in Michigan that I think if given enough money and time you’d find that they were all innocent or most of them. We do hire human beings. I can’t explain everything.
(01:35:48)
But when you have that happen and you see the bad guys just ignore you and Anthony will talk more about how it affects the people on the road. But we can’t hire and it’s not about money. People want to give money. I know you understand. You argue with these people and say, just throw money at it. It’s stupid. But if we can’t get the right candidates and we can’t get them because we’re not convincing them at a younger age that this is an honorable job. The honor’s gone.
(01:36:17)
I believe in it. I think people here believe in it. I know none of them want to be without police, but we need good people. And so the things that you do, the things that you talk about, qualified immunity, I think most people don’t know what it means. We understand it. I know you do. If they think what’s qualified immunity means we can go rob a bank and not get in trouble. Nobody understands that that’s not the case. But the things that you do for us, the things that you say, the times that you and I have met before you spoke at our convention, we did a big screen TV. The things you do really matter. And they do help us and we’re all behind you. 100%.

Donald J. Trump (01:37:05):

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So Jim, one thing we’re going to be doing and we’re going to be doing it strongly, and I’ve wanted to do it and looked at it for a long time, but we have to do it. Immunity for some of these. You said you have 14 people and you don’t believe, maybe one or two, I mean maybe some are guilty of something, but I would bet you a lot of them aren’t. And they’re going through hell and their pension is going to be gone. Frankly, their family’s going to end up being gone, their car, their house, everything. So we want to do immunity. We also want to call for the death penalty for anybody killing a police officer. We’ll be pressing and thank you for your support.

Jim Tignanelli (01:37:50):

We have an attorney general that’s after us right now.

Donald J. Trump (01:37:54):

Yeah, I know your attorney general.

Jim Tignanelli (01:37:55):

But most of these guys that do get found innocent are bankrupt by that time.

Donald J. Trump (01:37:58):

That’s right. If they’re innocent, they have no money left. That’s right.

Byron Donalds (01:38:02):

Anthony, if you don’t mind.

Donald J. Trump (01:38:03):

We’re going to be looking at that very strongly though, that police officers, they’re doing their job if they do their job and if they make a mistake, even if it’s a mistake, and that can happen. You were telling me, others were telling me they have a quarter of a second to make a decision. You would have a hard time with that. I mean literally a quarter of a second to make a decision. And if it’s the wrong decision, their life is over and we have to help people out now. It’s time. So we’re going to do the immunity thing and we’re going to fight alongside of them. We have to stop being politically correct. And you’re always going to have some bad apples, but they are very, very few. How many of the 14 would you say would be innocent?

Jim Tignanelli (01:38:47):

Innocent innocent. Probably about 10 of them.

Donald J. Trump (01:38:51):

All right.

Jim Tignanelli (01:38:52):

And maybe the others are overcharged. They’re still out of work.

Donald J. Trump (01:38:55):

Yeah. Yeah. It’s pretty tough stuff. It’s happening all over.

Jim Tignanelli (01:38:58):

It’s very expensive to defend yourself.

Donald J. Trump (01:39:00):

Well, they’re afraid to do their job too. They want to do their job, but they’re afraid to do their job. We’ll take care of it. Thank you, Jim. Great job.

Jim Tignanelli (01:39:07):

Thank you.

Donald J. Trump (01:39:07):

Thank you for the support.

Byron Donalds (01:39:12):

Mr. President we have also with us Anthony Hall. Anthony’s the president of the Lavonia Police Officers Association. 20 years on the job, 10 years on SWAT in western Wayne County. Anthony, you’ve seen a lot. Talk to us about the morale for officers since Kamala Harris and Joe Biden came into office.

Anthony Hall (01:39:32):

So I’ve been on the job for 20 years now and I have seven years left before I can retire. And since the new administration has taken over, we went from the middle of COVID where people were cheering as we were driving by their house during a lockdown when we turned on our lights and sirens to literally overnight having slurs or flipped off, driving down the road doing the same job we’ve been doing throughout the whole pandemic and throughout my whole career. So I think one of the biggest things is over scrutiny of our job and our profession and as a whole., after the George Floyd incident happened, it made being a police officer very difficult. And when something like that happens, you expect the pendulum to swing, right? And after Ferguson the pendulum swang like it did, and then it returned back to its neutral. And after George Floyd, even now, the pendulum hasn’t come back to neutral. And I attribute that to the current administration’s opinion with all law enforcement. They lack support for everyone.
(01:40:42)
And when I say over scrutiny, I’m not saying not holding us accountable. We should all be held accountable. But now everybody’s a self-proclaimed expert in our field. So there’s a big push to have civilian oversight committees, civilians that don’t do our job on a day-to-day basis to tell us what we’ve done and what we’ve done wrong. I have a lot of colleagues that have quit the job since George Floyd. Just left the profession entirely, probably over a dozen that I know personally. So that’s a big thing.
(01:41:19)
And then another thing too, I mean now we have less people doing the job that we’ve been doing all along, but now we just have fewer officers. And then another thing to throw the wrench into it is the bond reform that the current administration’s changed because now we arrest somebody and the criminal that we’ve arrested has made at home even before our officers are done with their shift. But hopefully in November we can change that.

Byron Donalds (01:41:57):

Mr. President. We also have us up with here a friend of ours, former member of Congress, Mike Rogers running for the United States Senate. Mike, you just heard from law enforcement,. You heard from law enforcement in the state of Michigan. What are your thoughts about the support for law enforcement in the state of Michigan? And frankly, you’re going to be a United States senator pretty soon, that’s what people tell me your thoughts for around the country as well.

Mike Rogers (01:42:21):

As my mother would say, from your lips to God’s ears. Oh, come on, people lighten up. Let’s go. You’re here with the next President of the United States of America. So not only do we have 700 fewer officers, we are 5,000 officers short across the state of Michigan. And the President rightly talks about qualified immunity for police officers that the Democrats have been chipping away and chipping away. And that doesn’t mean you don’t get charged if you commit a crime. It means if you’re doing your job, they can’t take your house.
(01:42:56)
And so people are making the decision every day in this state about not going into the business or getting out of the business because they’re chipping away at their ability to protect their families as well as protect our community. I was an FBI guy working in street crime. I will tell you the surge of illegal immigrants and the crime rate of illegal immigrants happening in our state, sexual assaults of young girls, a rape of a young girl in Oakland County, an illegal immigrant exposed himself to a nine-year-old girl. And as we know as former law enforcement guys, they’re on the path to do something really bad. All didn’t have to be here. 3,000 deaths of fentanyl here in the state of Michigan because of a wide open border that we could close today and it will happen when we elect Donald J. Trump.

Byron Donalds (01:43:57):

Mr. President also have with us Tricia Auten. Now Tricia, she’s a small business owner. The name of her business is Pretty Hunter. I’m going to let her talk about what Pretty Hunter is. I’m not a pretty hunter. I think Tricia’s a pretty Hunter. I’m going to let her talk about that. But Trisha is also a mother of three and she’s a candidate for the school board here in the state of Michigan. First of all, Tricia, explain to us what Pretty Hunter is, but then also really tell me about what’s on your mind about what the left is doing in our schools.

Tricia Auten (01:44:31):

Thank you for having me here this evening. Congressman Donald, and it’s such a pleasure to be in your presence, President Trump. So Pretty Hunter started for my quest for enjoying the outdoors. We live in the great state of Michigan. There’s a lot to enjoy. We design jewelry made out of once fired bullets because last I checked, bullets don’t decompose. So I consider our company saving the earth one bullet at a time. And yes, it is hunting season here in Michigan and beautiful as it is, we’re in archery soon, firearm season. But right now I’m hunting votes in the Walled Lake School District.
(01:45:21)
The question of what the left is doing wrong in the school system is very vast. So I’m going to try to keep this short and sweet. I can confidently tell you our schools have lost their way. The left has and is inundating our schools with DEI and ideological rhetoric while frivolous spending on shiny new buildings with a fireplace and waste buckets shipped to Michigan from California. I didn’t know Michigan didn’t have any five-gallon buckets available for our schools. Get to the bottom of that when I get on the board.
(01:45:56)
Meanwhile, our children are not reading at grade level. They are unlearning how to critically think for themselves. This is unacceptable. Across our nation and in my district of Walled Lake, our children are not thriving. As I see it, they’re simply surviving. We are seeing influence as early as preschool that introduces hate, fear into these young minds. And it’s devastating for me to uncover this as I’ve begun to run for the board. Our children are being taught that they have privilege or lack thereof. Some are even being taught that they’re less than because of the color of their skin or because of where or how they were born. President Trump, with you back in that Oval Office, I am confident that we can make our children’s future bright again.
(01:46:56)
And one last part, because schools are focusing on these ideologies, instead of focusing on academic foundations and hunting what is good in the world, we are ruining an entire generation of children. We are at a turning point in history, right now. In my opinion. We simply need to get back to basics. Literacy, arithmetic, I don’t know, maybe even writing. Furthermore, we simply need to put EDU before DEI. Thank you.

Donald J. Trump (01:47:34):

Thank you. Thank you Tricia. You’re right.

Byron Donalds (01:47:44):

Mr. President. Last but not least we have with us Tim Gregory. Tim Gregory is a UAW worker for 46 years with GM. 46 years.

Mike Rogers (01:47:53):

He looks good. He looks good.

Byron Donalds (01:47:57):

He does look good.

Mike Rogers (01:47:58):

You look young.

Tim Gregory (01:47:59):

Thank you.

Byron Donalds (01:48:01):

Tim, I know that for you, God comes first then your family and then this country.

Tim Gregory (01:48:08):

Amen.

Byron Donalds (01:48:09):

I know that. But tell us how you truly believe that Donald Trump is the answer, not just for Michigan, but for UAW workers to not only keep their jobs here in Michigan, but also to keep the auto industry alive and well in the United States.

Tim Gregory (01:48:29):

Thanks a lot for the introduction. Thank you for being here. And first of all, I’d like to thank you President Trump for being so tenacious and not giving up when others would have. And also because of the years I have working through the UAW and General Motors, I think that your record shows that because you have a background of being in business, I think that you see the changes and where we need to go in order to grow the business and grow the jobs.
(01:49:15)
And I also see that your policies in the past and the policies you say you’re going to enact with the border, with China, with our energy resources, the direction you wanted to take from a long time ago, back when you were president before. That’s why I think you’re best for this country. You’re best for the UAW and your best for the workers. And also I’d like to take this opportunity, and it’s not my notes, but I just want to say that I’ve always thought you as the most genuine candidate, and as a regular Joe as they introduced me. And I think that I appreciate that. I think you’re for the people and you’re for America. And that’s why I thank You’re the best.

Donald J. Trump (01:50:16):

Thank you. Well, I want to start by saying you look a lot younger than you must be, because if you’ve worked for the company 46 years, that’s a long time. You look like you’re 35 years old, I would say. What’s that all about? What are you doing? What are you doing? Well, you believe in God that I can see.

Tim Gregory (01:50:40):

I hear that once in a while.

Donald J. Trump (01:50:42):

But you’re very lucky in that sense. And thank you very much. It sort of pertains to what saying. So I’ll just make this statement. A big thing happened over the last couple of days for Michigan and for Detroit and for the country. Howard knows all about this, but some of the biggest auto plants in the world were planned for Mexico. And I’ve been talking about it for the last year. I’ve been talking about the whole concept for 10 years, 15 years. I mean, even as a private person, I couldn’t believe how they were just, how companies were and countries were coming in and stealing our jobs, stealing our plants. Everyone’s unemployed then they sell cars back in. All they do is you get fired and then they make the car and they sell it into our country. They make a lot of money. We make nothing. We have unemployment. And I’ve watched this for 20 years. I’ve watched it for so long and it’s disgraceful.
(01:51:35)
And so I have good news for you. I’ve been talking about in particular one giant plant, bigger than anything you’ve ever seen. And the story where a person I know he builds plants. That’s what he does. And I said, “I want to see a plant, a big one.” About a year ago, year and a half ago. And he said, “Okay, when do you want to go to Mexico?” I said, “No, I want to see one here.” He said, “We don’t build them here big, we build them, but they’re little by comparison. China’s building the biggest ones in Mexico.”
(01:52:06)
I said, “That’s not good. I don’t like that.” And he said, well, that’s the way it is.” I said, “I’m not going to Mexico, I’m not going to look at them in Mexico. I want to see him here.” So anyway, time went by and I started thinking about it. And in speeches, because it’s just an automatic instinct to me. I started saying, “Well, if they’re building a plant, they’re going to wipe out here.” That means they’re building a plant. They’re going to send the cars into our country one way or the other by the millions. And Detroit and Michigan, you had many more, you probably 60% wiped out from what it was in it’s heyday, maybe more than that.
(01:52:41)
I said, “You’re going to get wiped out. The rest of it’s going to be.” And then you have a union head who wants to build electric cars and they’re going to all be made in China, you know that. And we have a thing called liquid gold, which is oil and gas. We have a lot of it. And by the way, Brian, stand up for a second if you would please. This guy, he’s like you. He gets it so much. You know each other, maybe. He gets it so much. He gets it like nobody. And he’s been fighting against all of this nonsense for so long. And so the electric cars are going to…
(01:53:16)
And by the way, Elon, Musk is a great friend of mine. He gave me a tremendous endorsement. He’s right now campaigning in Pennsylvania because he thinks we have to win if we don’t win this election because she’s a Marxist. This woman has no idea what she’s doing and we can’t let her be president. I don’t want to be rude about it. We can’t let her be president. This country is finished, if that happens. I mean beyond a normal candidate, this country would be absolutely finished if she got it. So we have to stop her.
(01:53:46)
But what happened is, I’ve been thinking about it and what it would do to the country, and these are plants that are bigger than anything you’ve seen. They will knock out the cars, you press a button and the whole thing starts operating. And so I started talking about this, about what do you think brought a year ago, less than a year ago, that I won’t let it happen a year ago. And I said, “I’m not going to let it happen. If they do this plant in Mexico right near the border and a couple of others, I’m going to put giant tariffs on of a hundred percent. And if that doesn’t work, I’ll go to 200%. I don’t care. They’re not going to be selling cars here.”
(01:54:22)
Now if they want to build their plant here, I hope here, but at least in the United States, someplace in the United States, that’s a whole different ballgame. But we’re not going to have them building them in other countries, sending them into the United States, taking all those jobs. So I’ve been announcing it and I’ve been talking about it and I saw the gentleman that builds the plants. I was here a couple of weeks ago at the Detroit conference as you know, and it was really the auto conference. And so I look in the audience and there he is, the man that builds the plants. And I said, “Can I see you a minute before the speech?” And after the speech I saw him and I said, “So how is that plant doing?” He said, “Sir, they’ve decided not to build.” I said, “Why?” He said, “Because I think you’re going to be elected and if you put tariffs on it…” Thank you.
(01:55:17)
That was easy. I didn’t even do anything other than say, I’m telling you, the man said it right over here. It’s the most beautiful word in the dictionary. You have other words that are damn nice like love. But I tell you, I think it’s more beautiful than love, the word tariff. So here it works. Hey Brian, here it works without even doing anything. They thought there was a chance. And they’re not going to spend $2 billion on building a plant and then have Trump get elected and put 200%. And if that wasn’t enough, I’d raise it. And again, the higher it goes, the more likely it is that they build in this country. But think of it.
(01:55:58)
So they stop this giant plant just in the basis. Now if I don’t get elected, they will start it up as, sure as you’re sitting there. These people have no clue. She has no clue what she’s doing. She wants to raise everybody’s taxes. She’s a disaster. And other than that, I like her quite a bit. But no, I don’t care even about like, dislike. Somebody has to come in. We did great the first time. We did better the second time as everybody knows, we got millions and more votes. And frankly, if I didn’t, and some bad things happened, and let’s not talk about it because we’re going to make up for it this time. Too big to rig. But I will tell you, if I didn’t do well the second time, I wouldn’t have done it.
(01:56:39)
But I watched Biden and her and now especially her because she’s worse than Biden. I watched them and I said, “I got to run again. I got to run again.” That’s what happened. Because they said they’re ruining our country with the open border. I mean 8,000, just the drug dealers, 8,000 drug dealers, 13,099 murderers in jail. They’re going to let them out of jail. Some with death penalties. They’re just going to say, “Well, this is easier. We’ll just send them to the United States because their people don’t know what.”
(01:57:10)
But think of 13,000 plus people who murdered people and they’re going to be let free in our country. And then you have their prisons are being emptied up like Venezuela. They’re emptying up their prisons. Their crime is down 72% in Venezuela. If they get elected, we’re all friends. If they get elected, we’ll all meet next year in Venezuela because it’ll be the safest country because they’ve emptied out. And let tell you, it was a very unsafe country. Caracas, you couldn’t walk across the street. It’s sort of like some of our cities are getting right. Our cities are getting like that.
(01:57:44)
So just the thought of me getting elected stopped somebody from destroying the rest of Detroit, from destroying the state of Michigan’s auto industry and with your auto industry, so goes Michigan. I mean it’s a big deal. And we’re going to bring, actually we’re going to reverse that very easily. He knows because he’s got a natural, when he said, when I explained it to him, so he’s a business, he’s a savant. Is that good? He’s a savant. He knows. It took me about two minutes after. About two minutes. “Oh, I get it.” How long did it take you to understand the word tariff, two minutes or less?

Jim Tignanelli (01:58:20):

From you, it took two minutes.

Donald J. Trump (01:58:21):

It took very little. He figured it out very quickly. He wasn’t exposed to it, frankly. He actually said, “You mean you can really do that?” You couldn’t believe it. And we have another one, Paulson. He sort of was.

Jim Tignanelli (01:58:33):

He’s got it too.

Donald J. Trump (01:58:34):

He can’t even sleep at night, he’s so excited about it. But they have to be. And then we have stupid people that don’t know, they say, “Oh, tariff.” But they’re very stupid people. We have a senator from Pennsylvania who decided not to run. He fought me all the way on tariffs. This guy fought me and fought me. His name’s Toomey. He fought me and fought me and I wouldn’t endorse him. And he decided not to run based on that.
(01:58:56)
And that’s good because all he did was… I said, “So if China charges us 100%, can we for a similar product charge them 100%?” “No, sir.” “Okay, can we charge them 50% or 25%?” “No, sir.” “Why?” “It’s not free trade.” I said, “Explain that.” I said, “Can we charge him 10%, 2% or one?” “No sir. It’s not free trade.” I said, “You got to be kidding.” And I said, “I wouldn’t endorse you under any circumstances.”
(01:59:27)
Now I don’t know if he really believe this or because he’s not a stupid guy. Did he really believe this or was there something else going on?
(01:59:37)
But anyway, so we’re going to bring back the auto industry, but also, Tim, a of other industries. This pertains to many, many. We talk about cars because it’s so nice to talk about cars. It’s sort of the ultimate thing to manufacture. But we’re going to bring back a lot of industry and it’s going to be great. Fantastic presentation. We appreciate it. From everybody. From everybody. Is that your father over there? Who is that guy though, the good-looking guy? Is he your father with that shirt on? I like that color. I’m going to wear a couple of them now, I think. I’ve got such support from the Teamsters I’m going to have to wear that, I think. But I want to thank everybody and again, support always, you’ve been with me and I appreciate it very much, Jim, thank you very much. Thank you.

Donald J Trump (02:04):

Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. And a very, very special, we love this place. We love Detroit. Thank you very much. And hello to Michigan. We win Michigan, we win the whole ballgame. Thank you very much. I’m thrilled to be back in this incredible state with thousands and thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. Thank you very much, everybody.
(02:27)
So I’d like to begin by asking a very simple question. Are you better off now than you were four years ago?

Crowd (02:38):

No.

Donald J Trump (02:38):

Not even close, and our country’s not better off, that I can tell you. Early mail-in voting in Michigan is now underway. So here in Detroit, early in-person, voting starts tomorrow, so get the hell out and vote. You got to get out and vote. With your help, 18 days from now, we are going to win the state of Michigan. We are going to defeat Kamala Harris, and we are going to quite simply make America great again. We’re going to do it. We’re going to do it.
(03:15)
Detroit has such great potential, but Kamala and the Democrats have been wreaking havoc on this place, this very, very… In many respects, it’s a sacred place. So many things happened in Detroit and it’s been treated so badly. And they’ve been talking about comebacks for so long, but we’re going to bring it back better than it ever was, better than it was many, many years ago.
(03:41)
We’re going to make Detroit great again. We’re going to make it great again. They have been talking about it for years and years and years. For generations, this city and state where the world capital of automotive production and one of the great manufacturing centers in all of history. No matter where you went, this was the greatest in all of history. But year after year, globalist politicians like Crooked Joe Biden…

Crowd (04:06):

Boo.

Donald J Trump (04:10):

… Lying Kamala Harris…

Crowd (04:12):

Boo.

Donald J Trump (04:14):

… Sold you out and let other countries loot, pillage and plunder our wealth, our jobs, and our dreams. And they did that here more than any other place in our country. 40% of Michigan auto jobs were annihilated. After NAFTA and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization was a disaster for your beautiful place, your beautiful city, and frankly your beautiful state. Detroit was decimated. That’s right. Detroit was decimated as if by a foreign army. It was no difference. Our factories were left in ruins. And under Kamala Harris, this year alone, the United States has lost nearly 50,000 manufacturing jobs. They’re doing a terrible job. Did you see her interview the other night? She said, “Essentially I’d keep it the way Biden had it.” That’s great, that’s great. He got out because of the way he kept it. She’ll keep it the same way. U.S. car sales are down 38% since I left office. But with victory in November, we’re going to take back what is ours. And it is ours. We’re going to take it back. We’re going to bring back our jobs, our dignity, and our dreams. And standing before you tonight, I am proclaiming to the people of this state that by the end of my term, the entire world will be talking about the Michigan miracle and the stunning rebirth of Detroit. And this will be a real rebirth.
(05:54)
Under the Trump administration all who have robbed you, raided you, ransacked you, and abused you will discover very quickly, America will not be taken advantage of anymore. We were taken advantage of for years, for decades. We will reclaim our stolen wealth, and the days of Detroit’s economic glory will return greater and stronger than ever before. Promise. And I know how to do it. Oh, do I know how to do it… I will put Detroit first, I will put Michigan first, and I will put America first. And that’s the way it is.

Crowd (06:38):

USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA…

Donald J Trump (07:01):

As we speak, China was building a gigantic auto plant in Mexico. You know about that. And really more than one. Don’t worry about it. I took care of it for you, took care of it. It’s already done without even closing the big deal, which is the presidency. I’ve already got it done. Of course, if she got in, she has no idea what the hell she’s doing. She’s grossly incompetent, worse than him. Then I cannot tell you what’s going to… I can tell you. They’ll build the plant. I can tell you. But it’s already done. They think they’re going to sell all of their cars into the United States and destroy Michigan. But it’s not going to happen. It’s not going to happen. I promise you.
(07:57)
Now they’re building giant plants, and now they just announced something which is going to save Detroit. Because you would not be able to compete with this plant, the biggest in the world by far. Friend of mine builds them. He said the biggest in the world. He wanted to show it to me. I said, “No, thank you. I have other things to do.” I want to see the plants built in the United States. That’s the ones I want to look at. So I said to him, “John,” a year ago, “I want to see a plant.” And he said, “Sir, we’ll have to go to Mexico.” I said, “I don’t want to go to Mexico. I want to look at one here.” I said, “There’s no big ones being built in the United States.” I said, “That’s bad.” I said, “How big is it in Mexico? The biggest in the world?” I said, “So they’re going to make cars and sell them in here.” Kill Detroit, kill Michigan. You wouldn’t have anything left. You wouldn’t have anything left.

Crowd (08:46):

Boo.

Donald J Trump (08:49):

So the other day I was speaking… A couple of weeks ago, I was speaking at the Economic Club of Detroit, which was nice. Made a nice speech. And what happened? I saw John, who’s the biggest and the best auto builder. That’s what he does. He builds plants. I don’t know if he can build anything else. I’m not sure he can build an apartment, but plants he’s very good at. And I hadn’t spoken to him in a year. He was telling me about this massive plant. And I spoke and I explained how I’m going to put massive tariffs, very big tariffs on anybody in Mexico that’s selling cars that are going to hurt our business here. And I said to him, “How’s that plant coming along, John?” And he said, “Sir, they just told me it’s over. They’re not building it. They think Trump is going to win. He’s going to impose tariffs and it’s worthless.”
(09:37)
You owe me big. You owe me. You owe me. So they stopped construction. They’re not building it. And Detroit will survive. But now we got to make it more. Now we’re going to build the plants. So I’m going to do, sometime next week, I’m going to call the people building the plant. Very big wealthy company. It’s backed by China. It’s China, you know? It’s China. It’s in Mexico, but it’s China. And I’m going to say, “Build your plant in the United States.” We want people to build plants in the United States, employ our people. That’s what we want. And if you do that, it’s a whole different story. And ideally they’ll build it right here in Detroit. And we’ll get Detroit moving, and others will come also.
(10:33)
So vote Trump, and you’ll see a mass exodus of manufacturing jobs from Mexico to Michigan, from Shanghai to Sterling Heights, and from Beijing to right here in Detroit and other cities all across America. Because a strong auto industry will make all of Detroit richer, boosting suppliers, real estate and your entire economy. And I’ve been reading. Seriously, I’ve been reading about Detroit for so long, the comeback. This is the real comeback. This isn’t artificial stuff. This is the real comeback.
(11:14)
You better vote for me. So very simply… It’s not overly complex. Some people don’t understand it. If you watched Bloomberg the other day, you would’ve seen the CEO of Bloomberg interview me, and I think he understood it. And I think the Wall Street Journal now understands it. Because to me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary… It’s not love, it’s not respect…

(27:54)
Hey, guys.

Donald J Trump (30:27):

Well, thank you everybody. Thank you. So now what happens is I won’t pay the bill for this stupid company that rented us this track. I won’t pay the bill and then we’ll have a story that Trump didn’t pay the bill to a contractor. No, when they do the kind of a job, don’t pay the bill. That’s terrible. They also had a little problem with energy coming into the building, but I’m not blaming it on that. But here is my plan. Do we have fun?

Sam Thompson (30:56):

Yeah.

Donald J Trump (31:02):

And can everybody hear perfectly now?

Sam Thompson (31:06):

Yeah.

Donald J Trump (31:06):

I don’t like the mic anyway. I didn’t like it from the minute I started. And this is important because we’re doing things here that are really going to be amazing. So let me know and if it goes out again, I’ll sue the ass off that company. We’re going to sue him. Then they’ll say what a horrible guy Trump is. He’s a terrible guy. Starting in January, we will give our companies the lowest taxes, the lowest energy cost, the lowest regulatory burdens, the free access to the best and biggest market on the planet. That’s us. But only if they make their products here in America and hire American workers for the job.
(31:53)
And if these companies don’t make their cars and products here, then they will pay a tariff. A very stiff tariff when they send their products into the United States for the privilege of competing with our workers and our cherished companies. We’re going to protect our companies. We’re not going to let them steal our companies like they have in the past. We’re going to call this policy build it in America plan. Because when foreign leaders and CEOs call me up to complain about our tariffs, my answer will be very simple. Build it in America. Very simple.
(32:35)
And to be specific, build it in Detroit and we’ll give you good electricity. Or build it in Dearborn, or Lansing, or Grand Rapids, or Flint. Flint. The centerpiece of this plan will be a 15% made in America corporate tax rate. So we brought the rate down and you saw this from close to 40% to 21% and you’ve already had that. Nobody thought it could be done. We got it down to 21. Now we’re going to get it down to 15%, but only if they build it in America. Does that make sense?
(33:22)
And for those who don’t make their product in America, they will be forced to pay tariffs and we will take in hundreds of billions of dollars toward our budget. We’ll pay down our debt. We’ll reduce your taxes still further. I give you the largest tax cut in the history of our country and we will take in so much money and we will take in so many jobs and we will be bringing for the first time in years and years and decades, companies will be coming to us and they’ll be coming back to Detroit and they’ll love it. Some say my defense of American Jobs makes me a protectionist. And yes, I will protect what is ours. I will protect our workers. I will protect our jobs and I will protect our borders. I will protect our families and I will protect the birthright of our children to live in the richest and most powerful nation on the face of the earth. These pro-worker policies are among the many reasons, and it’s not protectionist, it’s pro-worker. It’s really not protectionist. We’ve had people ripping our country for years, decades destroying. You look outside, you see all the hulks, you see the empty buildings. For years and years they’ve been ripping us off. Now it’s time for us to get it back. We’re going to get it all back.
(34:58)
These pro-worker policies are among the many reasons why I’ve been overwhelmingly endorsed by the rank-and-file membership of the Teamsters, including 62% of the Teamster members and there are a lot of them here today. Stand up please. Teamsters, we love you. Thank you, thank you, thank you very much. Kamala does not even pretend to have a plan to save Detroit because she knows her agenda will reduce your future to rubble. He’s not going to… Her plan will drive every company, even small businesses out of our country or out of business. It’s a disaster. It is a disaster.
(35:41)
Kamala’s inflation has already cost a typical family over $30,000 in higher prices and now she’s proposing to raise the typical family’s taxes by nearly $3,000 a year. So watch these two videos. Let’s see if they have some electricity going to them please. And it would be nice if the television cameras could watch them also because they don’t do that.

Speaker 2 (36:08):

… President, there are many different tax policies which could cripple the economy. But the first thing she wants to do is allow these Trump tax cuts to expire.

Speaker 7 (36:15):

Even the New York Times admits that 85% of the middle class got a tax cut.

Speaker 3 (36:20):

Americans will face a hike. The tax foundation, finding that a couple with two kids making $165,000 a year would have to pay over $2,400 more in taxes.

Kamala Harris (36:32):

And on day one, I will repeal that tax bill. Joe Biden and I are about to work to get rid of that tax cut. Joe and I are about to get rid of that tax bill. Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax cut. Everything from a 70 to 80% tax rate. I think that’s fantastic. We’ve got to increase the corporate tax rate. Part of that is going to be about repealing that tax bill that they just passed. And also looking at estate taxes are going to have to go up. We will tax capital gains. But we’re going to have to raise corporate taxes.

Speaker 4 (37:01):

Taxing unrealized gains just doesn’t seem fair in any sense of the word.

Speaker 5 (37:05):

When the value of your home goes up. You pay higher taxes. Even if you don’t sell your home.

Speaker 4 (37:09):

Your value of your home never moves. The way the stock moves to say, we’re going to tax what you don’t have. That’s a sore point and it’s a big deal. Is that something you think she firmly believes in?

Speaker 5 (37:19):

I think it’s part of the proposals of the campaign.

Kamala Harris (37:21):

Under my plan, there will also be a carbon fee. There has to be some connection between the fee and bad behaviors and that we have to monitor whether it’s going to be passed on to consumers. But I’m going to tell you that should never be the reason not to actually put a fee. And in particular, carbon fee.

Speaker 6 (37:42):

Kamala Harris is going to significantly raise taxes.

Kamala Harris (37:45):

Taxes are going to have to go up.

Speaker 6 (37:46):

Kamala’s plan will raise families taxes by nearly $2,600 a year. Under Kamala, prices have already soared. Now she’d make it worse with even higher taxes.

Kamala Harris (37:58):

Taxes are going to have to go up.

Speaker 6 (38:00):

President Trump will cut taxes again. No taxes on tips, overtime, or social security.

Donald J Trump (38:08):

I’m Donald J. Trump and I approve this message.
(38:14)
Thank you. Thank you very much. This is the worst mic I’ve ever had in my life. This is the worst. The tax queen is also demanding a shocking 33% tax hike on all domestic production along with the largest capital gains tax hike in the history of our country. In other words, she’s going to tax your companies and you out of business. The companies are going to leave and you’re going to end up with the same message you’ve had for the last 40 years. In total, our proposals are estimated to kill almost a million full-time jobs under Kamala, who knows absolutely nothing about what we’re doing. It will be economic Armageddon for Detroit. You go back further… Very simply, we’re going to make it great. We’re going to make it so good. You’re going to have jobs coming in like never before.
(39:18)
Under Trump we’ll turn this city into the most powerful jobs magnet in the history of the world. Upon taking office, I will immediately begin to eliminate every job killing regulation in the books. We eliminated more than any other President in four years. There’s never been a President that eliminated more times five. As a senator… Oh, this one here, Kamala. You know I’d like to call her Harris, but nobody knows who the hell I’m talking about. You ever see that? Like you say Harris, “Who the hell is Harris?” As a senator, Kamala voted to impose a 100% ban on gas powered cars and trucks, which would kill an estimated 200,000 U.S. auto jobs.
(40:10)
On day one of the Trump administration, I will terminate Kamala’s insane electric vehicle mandate and we will end the green news scam once and for all. We will quickly become energy independent and we will frack, frack, frack and drill baby drill. I will cut your energy prices in half within 12 months. So listen, I will cut your energy prices in half, 50%, 5-0. Cut them in half within 12 months of taking office. That’s going to bring everything down. I will massively cut taxes for workers and small business and we will also have no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on social security benefits for our seniors.
(41:11)
I will make interest on car loans fully tax-deductible. And we will… They will be so listen to that. What will that do for the cars? Fully tax-deductible interest on a car. You buy a car and you get a deduction. Wall Street called me up. They said, “How the hell did you think of that idea?” That’s a good one because affording a car is essential to restoring the American dream and you’re going to have the American dream. Finally, I haven’t had it in 50 years. Working with Elon Musk… Is he good or what? I saw that rocket come down three, four days ago. That sucker was coming down. I said, “Oh my God, I never saw anything like it.” I was on the phone with a friend. I’m talking about something. I don’t know, something maybe having to do with Detroit. Could that be possible?
(42:06)
But I’m talking on the phone and I see the screen is on and no sound. And I’m saying, “Wait a minute, I have to put the phone down. I don’t believe what I’m seeing.” And I saw that big monster coming down that big… It’s like a twenty-story building or something coming down. The engines are glowing and they’re firing and spitting. And I said, “It’s going to crash. It’s going to crash into the gantry, don’t crash.” And then you see another engine take it perfectly and lands right at the spot that it took off. I said, “That must be Elon. He’s nailed it. Nobody else.” It must be Elon. So I called up Elon. I said, “Elon, was that you?” He goes, “That was me.” I said, “Who else can do it?.” “Nobody.” I said, “Can Russia do it?” “No.” “Can the U.S. do it? Meaning the U.S. outside of you?” He said, “No, nobody can do that.” I said, “You’re the coolest. That’s pretty.” And he endorsed me long time ago actually saying It’s the most important election we’ve ever had.
(43:14)
But working with Elon Musk, we will cut trillions of dollars in government waste. He’s very good at that. He knows better than anybody. It won’t affect anybody other than it’ll look awfully good and it’ll help bring our country back. I want to thank also Elon for campaigning so hard in Pennsylvania. Do you know he actually feels this? Can you imagine? He just lands his biggest landing anyone’s ever seen and he leaves for Pennsylvania to campaign for me. Can you imagine that?
(43:46)
And he also, and we got to say this. I went to North Carolina, which really was hit hard. Georgia too, really hit hard. But in North Carolina they had no communications. It was like they were an island unto themselves. And I said to the people, “What can we do?” He said, “We have no communication. People are dying. It’s a mess.” They said, “The federal government, Washington is doing a terrible job. Sir, do you know Elon Musk?” I said, “I happen to know him. He endorsed me. What’s the problem?” He said, “Can you get Starlink?” I said, “What the hell is Starlink?” And they explained it to me. I’m a fast study. It didn’t take too long. So I called up Elon and I was saying, “Elon, we’re in North Carolina. The people are really… It’s devastation here. It’s unbelievable. They have no communication to the mainland. It’s like it cut it off. It’s incredible. The water was never… We’ve never seen anything like that.”
(44:44)
I said, “Elon, Starlink.” It’s very hard to get by the way, because it’s very successful, very hard to get. I said, “Can you get Starlink, a lot of those suckers? Can you get them for North Carolina and parts of Georgia?” And I was talking to him about it and all of a sudden I get a call in the other line. It’s the man from North Carolina. “Thank you sir, for getting the Starlink.” I said, “I haven’t even finished my conversation.” Now think of that. I said, “Elon, I haven’t even finished my conversation. And they’re already saying, you sent.” “That’s right. I did that. I do two things at one time. I can do that.” So he’s great. He saved a lot of lives, I think, and he really… And by the way, the Starlink worked perfectly. As soon as he got there was perfect. So thank you to Elon for that he did a great job.
(45:38)
And if we do all of this, our flag will fly proudly once more over the gleaming new factories and the whole world will witness Michigan’s resurgence. Wealth will flood into our country and into the hands of our great workers. And that is the future that awaits for Detroit under a certain gentleman named President

Donald J Trump (46:00):

… President Donald J. Trump. Have you heard of him? It’s going to be real. It’s going to be real. As we rebuild our economy, we’ll also restore our borders. Did you ever see anything like what’s coming through our borders? Criminals, drug dealers, prisoners, people from mental institutions. For four straight years, Kamala has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from prisons and jails, insane asylums and mental institutions all around the world from Venezuela to the Congo, and she’s resettled them into your communities to prey upon innocent Americans. I happen to think it’s the worst thing that’s happened. I think it’s worse than inflation. I think it’s worse than a bad economy. I think it’s the worst thing that happened to us.
(46:58)
21 million people. When I win on November 5th, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins. I have no choice. One of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gangs that Kamala has imported into our country… Or to say it a little differently, Kamala, but I don’t give a damn if I pronounce it right. Who the hell can pronounce? It’s the savage Venezuelan prison gang, Tren de Aragua. Do you know them? It’s a very nice group of young gentlemen, very fine people. There were gang members in Venezuela. We let them into our country. By the way, they’re taking over parts of cities all over the place. But in Aurora, Colorado and communities in all 50 states, this gang is terrorizing law-abiding citizens, including taking over multiple apartment complexes. You have to take a look at this. Take a look.

Speaker 8 (48:08):

Open borders, deadly consequences.

Speaker 9 (48:10):

Border crisis. Record-high crossings are putting a strain on cities across America. It’s a full-blown invasion.

Speaker 8 (48:17):

Armed Venezuelan gang members storming an apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado-

Speaker 9 (48:22):

When people talk about migrant crime, this is what they’re talking about. Biden and Harris had created a program to bring them in under humanitarian parole?

Speaker 10 (48:29):

I am in favor of saying that we’re not going to treat people who are undocumented who cross borders, criminals.

Speaker 8 (48:34):

More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder have been released into the United States.

Speaker 11 (48:41):

My 20-year-old daughter, Kayla Hamilton, was murdered in her own room. Kayla’s murderer was apprehended by border patrol crossing illegally into the US.

Speaker 12 (48:50):

Kayla’s murderer had been improperly released into the United States.

Speaker 10 (48:53):

Abolish ice. Yeah, we need to probably think about starting from scratch.

Speaker 14 (48:57):

The Afghan national is in custody the day after being accused of plotting an election day terrorist attack. The suspect entered the US on a special immigrant visa-

Speaker 8 (49:05):

More than a dozen people suspected of being Tren de Aragua gang members right here in San Antonio.

Speaker 9 (49:09):

The gang members had been terrorizing the apartment complex.

Speaker 13 (49:13):

New details in the murder of Laken Riley. The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuelan national.

Speaker 15 (49:20):

And was paroled and released into the country by the Biden administration.

Speaker 13 (49:24):

Two men, investigators say are in the country illegally from Venezuela, are charged with capital murder and the death of Jocelyn Nungaray.

Speaker 16 (49:30):

Court documents suggest a group of men arrested for beating and robbing a Dallas woman last month are members of a Venezuelan street gang.

Speaker 17 (49:38):

Manuel Hernandez-Hernandez was booked by Colleyville Police just two days earlier and released the day before the robbery.

Donald J Trump (49:54):

Just so you know, we have the most dangerous criminals in the world in our country now. We never had anything like this. These are the most dangerous criminals in the world. They make our criminals look like very nice people. That’s about the only thing you can say. But they are the worst among the worst people and they come from all over the world. I thought it was 158 countries. Last week, they reported it’s 181 countries. They’re coming from all over the world. They’re emptying their prisons into our country, mental institutions, into our country, and they’re taking their street gangs, and their drug dealers, and terrorists are now in our country. 21 million people came in under their rule and she was in charge of the border. She’s a grossly incompetent person and we can’t let this happen. We have to get the hell out and vote and get them out of here.
(50:52)
The United States is now an occupied country. How about that? Do you ever think you’d be hearing that? We’re an occupied country. We’re being occupied. If you have a million person army, that’s a big army. They’ve got millions and millions of people. If they just take a small percentage of them, they’d have six million-man or woman army. Think of that. They’ve let these people into our country, they’re emptying out the jails all over the world, the mental institutions all over the world, they’re coming in. I think it’s the biggest problem we have. I don’t care. Deflation and inflation, it’s all bad stuff, but this is… The polls say the biggest problem is our economy, which stinks. The second-biggest problem is inflation, which is worst we’ve ever had. And the third is our border. I think the border is the first biggest problem [inaudible 00:51:59] three. But November 5th, 2024 will be Liberation Day in America.
(52:22)
And when I get rid of this microphone at the end of the speech, it’s going to be Liberation Day for Donald J. Trump because I’m blowing out my voice to get this sucker done. I’m blowing out my voice. But I’m going to get through this speech because you’re from Detroit. We’re going to turn this place around. We’re going to make sure that electric current comes into it like it should. Liberation of Donald Trump. Good night, folks. That’ll be… That’s terrible. But I think it’s okay. I mean, you can hear it. If I scream like hell into the mic, I think good for you, not so good for me. But that’s okay. That’s what my life has been about for the last 10 years. And that’s good because we love you. We’re going to turn it all around for you. Under Kamala Harris, 13,099 illegal aliens, convicted murderers are on the loose in the United States. Immediately upon taking the oath of office, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. I have no choice. We have no choice.
(53:36)
I will rescue every town across America that’s been invaded and conquered, and I will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail or kick them the hell out of our country, which is my number one [inaudible 00:53:49]. To expedite removals of the Tren de Aragua gangs and other savage gangs like MS-13, which is just as bad. We have by the thousands now. I took them out by the thousands and they now are coming back in by the thousands. These people, what they’ve done to our country, I can’t even believe it. I can’t even believe it. I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, that’s where we had to go, to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil. We will call it Operation Aurora. We want to pay tribute to Aurora, Colorado. The governor there is a radical left Democrat. He is petrified. The guy just don’t want to walk out of his mansion. And if they come back into our country, it’s an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole. So we keep them out.
(54:56)
And I am hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer. Kamala’s migrant invasion is also devastating our great African-American community, stealing American jobs, crushing wages, undercutting the voting power of our own citizens and bringing drugs, crime, and death to our country. We’re devastating the African-American population, they’re taking their jobs. It’s terrible. It’s terrible. And also Hispanic, they’re taking a lot of Hispanic jobs. And the jobs created by Biden are all being taken by people coming into the country illegally. So it’s terrible. Yet Kamala says there is nothing she would do differently. Listen to this, she’ll do nothing differently.

Speaker 18 (56:09):

Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?

Kamala Harris (56:15):

There is not a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 19 (56:17):

I stood there on the tarmac watching you check your watch.

Speaker 20 (56:19):

The chaotic and deadly US evacuation from Afghanistan stunned Americans and the world and cost the lives of 13 US soldiers.

Speaker 18 (56:27):

Would you have done something differently?

Kamala Harris (56:29):

There is not a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 21 (56:31):

More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder have been caught at the border, and then released into the United States.

Speaker 22 (56:39):

An Afghan national is in custody today after being accused of plotting an election day terrorist attack. The suspect entered the US on a special immigrant visa-

Speaker 23 (56:47):

Gut-wrenching new details in the murder of Georgia nursing student, Laken Riley. The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuelan national who crossed the unsecured southern border back in 2022.

Speaker 24 (56:59):

Two men, investigators say are in the country illegally from Venezuela, are charged with capital murder and the death of Jocelyn Nungaray.

Speaker 25 (57:06):

A fifth illegal immigrant accused of attacking two New York City police officers over the weekend showed no remorse or regret.

Speaker 18 (57:14):

Would you have done something differently?

Kamala Harris (57:16):

There is not a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 26 (57:18):

Only 18%. So the economy is in excellent or good condition.

Speaker 27 (57:22):

US inflation has hit a new 40-year high, increasing by 9.1% over the financial year.

Speaker 28 (57:28):

The cost of homes have spiked. Homebuyers need to earn 80% more than they did in 2020 to afford a house.

Speaker 18 (57:37):

Were you the last person in the room?

Kamala Harris (57:38):

Yes.

Donald J Trump (57:47):

She destroyed San Francisco. She destroyed California along with Gavin Newscum. Destroyed it. Did you say when Newscum said that you’re not allowed to even ask for voter ID? If anybody asks somebody for voter ID, it’s considered a crime. You know why? Because they want to cheat. There’s only one reason why. We want to be very careful. Detroit, if you want to end this disaster, you must get out and vote. You have to get out and vote right now. And with that, I’d like to acknowledge some of our great friends and he just spoke, so I don’t want to have to waste his time. But he did just speak and he’s great. He’s one of our really true leaders in this country. We’re all lucky to have him running for the Senate. Mike Rogers. Where’s Mike? Mike, thank you, Mike.
(58:51)
And I don’t want him to get up and use this crappy microphone that they sent. I don’t want him to do that. I want to keep him good and healthy. Unlike Trump, I want him to have his voice tomorrow. When I get up tomorrow and I can’t speak, I’m going to say Detroit did it to me, but that’s… We’re also pleased to be joined by a future star and, really, a current star. He’s a great guy. He’s a friend of mine. Congressman… Do you know who he is? Byron Donalds. Congressman Donalds, thank you. Thank you, Byron. He’s a great guy. He’s a great guy. Thank you very much, Byron. Michigan House Republican leader, Matt Hall. Matt, thank you, Matt. How are we doing here, Matt? We doing good? Going to win? I hope. We got to win. So far, we’re winning. And Senate Republican leader, Eric Nesbitt. Thank you, Eric. Thank you very much, Eric.
(01:00:02)
A man that I said, “You got to do this. You got to do it.” He wasn’t sure if he wanted to. He had a great career. I said, “I’m sorry, Pete Hoekstra. You got to do it. You got to become the GOP chairman.” Ambassador Pete Hoekstra. Thank you, Pete. Great job. So, Pete, are we going to win? Thus far, I hear like, “Way above projection. We’re not even talking about polls anymore. These are way above projection.” A man who is probably more knowledgeable about autoworkers for Trump and autoworkers, period, and who knows exactly what we’re doing. He’s a member of the union, but he’s not happy with what they’re doing with the whole thing, what they’re doing. They’ve lost a lot of jobs over the last few months and it’s going to continue until you have no jobs in this country. We’re not going to let it happen. We are going to have more jobs and it’s going to be more powerful as an automobile capital than it was in its heyday, 60 years, 70 years ago.
(01:01:10)
It’s going to happen. It’s going to happen fast. Brian? Brian, stand up. Pannebecker. Brian Pannebecker, thank you very much. Thank you, Brian. And Dr. Massad Boulos, great friend of mine, and Michael Boulos, my son-in-law, he’s a wonderful young man. Stand up, please. That’s good. That’s good. He got lucky, he married Tiffany, and they’re having a baby. A beautiful little baby. We also have a man highly respected in Michigan, Imam Husainy. Imam, please, wherever you may be, stand up. Thank you. Thank you very much. Great. Thank you very much. Great honor to have you. And we have a guy… I made so much money with this guy. He was brutal. He was a brutal man. Happened to come from a place called Detroit, or as they say, Detroit. He says, “I come from Detroit,” which is cool as hell if you’re The Hitman, Tommy Hearns. The Hit Man. Tommy, come up here, Tommy. Come up. Come. Come. Come up here. Tommy the Hitman. We love Tommy. I won so much money betting on this guy. He was brutal. We love that. Look at him. He still looks good. He still looks good. Wow. They have to take… Secret Service has got a little… I don’t know, is there such a thing as [inaudible 01:03:10]? But Tommy is going to have to cross about nine gates. I don’t think so, Tommy. About 25 years ago, he would’ve just hopped over them. Hey, Tommy, you’re still good, huh? You think I could take you now in a fight right now? No, I don’t think so. Look at him. He wants to… Oh, no, he wants to fight. Oh, Tommy the Hitman. Man, oh, man. Some of the greatest fights in history. Oh, look, he wants to come up. We should have him up, right? Come on, Tommy. Man, oh, man. I saw them in the audience. I said, “We got to get… I see a lot of people in the audience. I’m not bringing them up. Come on, Tommy. One of the greatest fighters of all time. And, man, I’ll tell you what, he was something special. And thank you, Tommy. And he looks great, doesn’t he? He looks great.

Tommy Hearns (01:04:33):

Now, hearing those nice words coming from you, man, it’s got to be real. It’s got to be real. Because, I myself, I never thought I was told [inaudible 01:04:48] great fighter, but I thought I did a pretty good job. But hearing it come from you, Donald, I’m excited. I’m very excited. I want to fight now.

Donald J Trump (01:05:12):

Man, could he fight. He was a natural. He had hips a little bit smaller than mine. He had shoulders a little bit larger than mine. See, he went in the right proportion. That’s the way it’s supposed to be, right? Thank you, Tommy. They love him in Detroit, right? They love him in Detroit. Another man that they love in Detroit is a rapper and he’s one of the hottest in the world, actually. Trick Trick. Where’s Trick Trick. Trick Trick. Come here, Trick Trick. Come here. Maybe we should have him do a little rapping or something, huh? Come here. Look at him. He looks good. He looks good. You look good.

Trick Trick (01:06:09):

What up now, Detroit. If y’all know about Trick Trick, y’all know I’m about bringing it all to Detroit. So please welcome the 47th President of the United States, as we make Detroit great again.

Donald J Trump (01:06:38):

Thank you very much. That’s great. You have some great people here, I’ll tell you. This is a great place. We are going to really make… We are. We’re going to make it great again. Like the country, and we did it, and then we have to do it again because they blew it. They blew it to hell. But we’re going to do it again. Thank you, Trick Trick. Here are some of the facts on Kamala Harris. After talking to The Hitman and Trick Trick, it seems boring getting back into Kamala, but that’s what we got to do. We got to save our country, right? Mr. Wall. Mr. Wall, stand up please. This guy is great. He’s a wealthy guy. He made a lot of money. He comes to… How many would you say? You’re at 350 or something? He’s got a lot. This guy’s got lots of cash and I love his… Someday, I’m going to wear one of them to a rally.
(01:07:37)
Actually, I think it would be well-received because we built 571 miles of wall, we had it made, we were going to build another 200 miles of wall, and then they decided to sell it for five cents on the dollar. But we’re going to get it done. We built much more than I said I was going to build. And we had the safest border in the history of our country. By the way, my all-time favorite graph, can we put it up? That’s my all-time favorite. Illegal immigration saved my life, if you think about it. But that arrow in the bottom, that’s when I left office. That was the lowest point of illegal immigration, and that included drugs and so many other things. It was just everything. But it was also… They dealt with so many different elements of different forms of crime, the people that were coming in. And look what happened after that. Look at that. So that was me. That was me in the last day, and then you look, it was like

Donald J Trump (01:09:00):

… Like a rocket ship. It was like Elon Musk set the rocket ship up and that was loaded up with criminals of the worst kind. And that’s what we have now in our country. And it’s worse than that, because that one, I want to keep it just the way it was. I’m not going to change it at all. But the numbers on the right, they continue for a long time. It’s just an amazing thing. But we love that piece of paper. We love that chart more than any. I sleep with it. I kiss it every night. I do have that throbbing feeling in my right ear, throbbing feel. But that’s okay. That’s great. Thank you very much. So that was the best in history. That was the best in recorded history, anyway. That was the lowest. It was the day I left office, they had human trafficking at a level, the lowest level. Now it’s about 12 times. Sorry. And they traffic in women, they traffic not, I mean in children, but they traffic in women more than any other thing. It’s a horrible, you wouldn’t even believe it could be possible. So thank you very much. I just wanted to see if you had that. I looked to the right and a lot of things happened. And you know, we went to Butler a few weeks ago and we had a celebration. 101,000 people showed up. 101,000. Butler, Pennsylvania, 101,000 people showed up and it was a beautiful tribute to Corey, the great firefighter.
(01:10:29)
He was a great guy, a big, big Trump fan, and two other wonderful gentlemen were really hurt badly. They thought they were not going to make it and the doctors did an unbelievable job, and they’re getting better and better and better. But that’s a rough thing. That was some evening, I will tell you. But what was really something, and we had an opera singer that was so incredible, right? We had an opera singer that was incredible. We had the Belles of Notre Dame. Now, they were recorded. We tried bringing them over, but they wouldn’t let us do that. But we had a moment of silence. Then the bells rang and then the opera singer sang, and we had Ave Maria by Pavarotti. We had a whole night. It was an unbelievable tribute. It was a tribute to him. 101,000 people.
(01:11:23)
Kamala Harris is a radical left Marx, is rated even worse than Bernie Sanders and even worse than Pocahontas. Does anyone know Pocahontas? The great Pocahontas, they said, “You should never use that term. Please apologize.”
(01:11:39)
I said, “I’d like to apologize to the real Pocahontas for…”
(01:11:47)
Kamala destroyed our border. She destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of Defund the Police movement. Anybody that wants to defund the police even for one day, we don’t want them. They’re not worthy of being the President of the United States. If you have that ideology, and she does, she’s a Marxist, communist, fascist, anything you want. Remember, I said we will never be a socialist country? Remember I said that? I’d said, “We will not be a socialist country.”
(01:12:27)
And I was right. We skipped socialism, we went down to communism. So I was right. I like to be right. I was right for the wrong reasons, right? Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE. These are the greatest people. They’re tough, they’re smart, and they love our country and they take people out that nobody else wants to touch. I have some friends in the front row, they’re very tough. They’re not doing it. They said, we’ll pass. And she wants to get rid of them. She wants to get rid of ICE. She wants to ban fracking, and as California Attorney General, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon, and rape of an unconscious person as nonviolent crimes. She pledged, think of that, she pledged to confiscate your guns. Would anybody like to give up their guns? She wants to confiscate.
(01:13:22)
You feel a little safer when you have all these criminals. Think of it. They allow hundreds of thousands of prisoners to come into our country. Some are murderers, some are drug dealers. They come in and then they say, “By the way, we’re taking away your guns also,” right? They don’t go, “Would anybody like to volunteer to give up your guns? Please raise your hand.”
(01:13:44)
Oh, we have a one guy. I think I have a feeling he won’t be doing it when they…

Crowd (01:13:48):

[inaudible 01:13:49].

Donald J Trump (01:13:50):

Thank you very much.

Crowd (01:13:51):

[inaudible 01:13:52].

Donald J Trump (01:13:53):

Good, thank you. Sit down. That’s enough. He’s our friend, but that’s enough. And endorsed a total ban on handgun ownership. She wants to endorse a ban, a big one. She already did. She even called for free sex changes for illegal aliens in detention. How about that one? And most importantly of all, she lied about working at McDonald’s. That’s not a big thing, but can I be honest with you? It’s terrible. But there is a video, we talk about woke and they want to take us woke. And we have a video that I think you’ll enjoy. It’s about when we won two World Wars, when we were the, although we did defeat ISIS in about four weeks. I will tell, we have a great military, but I think you’ll enjoy this. The way it used to be and the way it is right now.

Video (01:14:57):

You little scumbag, I got your name. I’ve got your ass. You will not laugh, you will not cry. You’ll learn by the number.
(01:15:05)
Happy pride. Happy pride month. And actually, let’s declare it a summer of pride.
(01:15:10)
So you’re a killer?
(01:15:11)
Sir, yes sir.
(01:15:12)
Let me see your war face.
(01:15:14)
Sir?
(01:15:14)
You’ve got a war face?
(01:15:16)
Ah.
(01:15:18)
That’s a war face. Now, let me see your war face.
(01:15:20)
Ahhh.
(01:15:20)
Bullshit. You didn’t convince me. Let me see your real war face. Ahhhhhh.
(01:15:33)
I know you want to take.
(01:15:33)
You will be a weapon. You will be a minister of death, praying for war. But until that day, you are pukes. You are the lowest form of life on earth. You are not even human fucking beings. You are nothing but unorganized, grab-assing pieces of amphibian shit.

It looks to me like the best part of you ran down the crack of your mama’s ass and ended up as a brown stain on the mattress.

Donald J Trump (01:16:13):

Pretty cool, right? We won two World Wars. Remember that. We won plenty of others and we defeated ISIS so rapidly nobody can believe it, in a matter of weeks. They said it was going to take five years. We did it in a matter of weeks. In conclusion, with your vote this November, we are going to fire Kamala and we are going to save America. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always cherish our great American flag. We will cut your taxes, crush inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages, and create the greatest job boom the world has ever seen. We’re going to do that very easily. Very easily. We will hire American, buy American, build American, grow American, and show the whole world that the American dream is back bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. I will stop the… Absolutely darling. And I will stop the global theft of American jobs and turn the US into the manufacturing superpower of the world. I will end the war in Ukraine immediately. I will get it done while I’m President-elect. Stop the chaos in the Middle East and prevent World War III. We are very close to World War III. We are very, very close to World War III, because we have incompetent people. Ukraine would’ve never happened. October 7th would’ve never happened. Inflation would’ve never happened. It was caused by their stupid energy policy.
(01:18:18)
None of this stuff would’ve happened and we wouldn’t have had that horrible situation in Afghanistan. The most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. 13 dead soldiers, many people dead, many people and soldiers just devastated, loss of legs and arms. All of that wouldn’t have happened. And of course, we gave them tens of billions of dollars worth of brand new military equipment that I bought, I bought and they gave it away to the Taliban. I think it was the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. And because of that, Putin said, “This is a paper tiger. I’m going to go into Ukraine.”
(01:18:58)
But he would’ve never done it if I were President. And even the Democrats admit that frankly, I will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources and respect that they so dearly, they so dearly deserve. We will strengthen and modernize our military. You know, I rebuilt our military, we rebuilt our military, but we’re going to bring it to a next step. We will build a missile defense shield, all made in the USA, a lot of it made right here. And we will put these Stars and Stripes on the surface of Mars, and maybe with the help of Elon, we’ll get it done quickly. We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington, DC, making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. We will, remember this one, we will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools. It’ll be God. And we will keep men out of women’s sports.
(01:20:15)
I will defend religious liberty, your right to free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will do that. Second Amendment. After years and years of building up other countries, we will protect our borders, defend our families, and protect our American suburb, cities and towns like never before. We will end sanctuary cities and we will stop illegal immigration once and for all. We will put American citizens first. We will put American citizens first, American children first, American patients first. Our American taxpayers first, American workers first, and American communities first.
(01:21:10)
And we will put communists, Marxists, and fascists last if that’s okay. And they will always be last. They will never make a comeback. They’re getting very close. We’ve got to win this election or they’re going to be there. They’re going to be there. We will not be invaded. We will not be occupied. We will not be conquered. And we will be a strong, proud, and free nation once again. We will defend our civilization, reclaim our sovereignty, and I will give you back your freedom, your future, and your life. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda once and for all. We want a landslide. And it looks like that could be happening, too big to risk.
(01:22:17)
Early voting is underway. So get everyone you know and go out and vote. Go tomorrow. It’s just starting. Go and vote. Make sure you vote and bring all our friends that want to vote for us. Tell him, “Jill, get your fat husband off the couch. Get that fat pig off the couch. Tell him to go and vote for Trump. He’s going to save our country.”
(01:22:46)
Get that guy the hell off our… Get him up, Jill, slap him around. Get him up. Get him up, Jill, we want him off the couch to get out and vote. Bring your friends and get them out. After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge. And this is true. I really believe this, we’re on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of our country.
(01:23:11)
With your help from now until election day. We’re talking about 19 days. 19. We will redeem America’s promise and we will take back the nation that we love. We have to take it back, because we’ve lost it. We’ve lost it. Nothing will sway us, nothing will slow us, and no one will stop us. We will press forward to our magnificent American destiny and together we will fight, fight, fight and vote, vote, vote. And we will win, win, win. We’re going to win, win, win. And November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country. And together we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you and God bless you all. God bless you. Thank you everybody.

I could put my arms around every boy I see.

Guess what he told me?

Donald Trump (30:56):

When I first came into office, I cut taxes, more than any other president. We have created seven million new jobs, and it led to a growth like we’ve never seen before. We developed the greatest economy in history, by far.
(31:11)
When I left office, it changed. Inflation destroyed the lives of so many people. Interest rates went from 2% to 10%. Millions of illegal immigrants, traffickers, and drugs coming into our country. Our country has gone to hell. So, I made a decision to run.
(31:34)
We’re going to make America great again, greater than ever before. I will fight for you with every breath, and I will never let you down.

MUSIC (31:46):

We can’t allow our country to be destroyed by politicians who will put their own power ahead of the interests of the American people, our freedom, and our future.

Amber Rose (32:23):

The left told me to hate Trump. When you cut through the lies, you realize the truth: American families were better when Donald Trump was president. We were safer, wealthier, and stronger.

Donald Trump Jr. (32:34):

So, if you love this country, if you want to stand up and fight for the future of our nation, you must re-elect Donald J. Trump.

MUSIC (32:42):

Tell everyone.
(32:42)
I’ll never quit.

Audience (32:42):

Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump!

Speaker 4 (32:42):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next President of the United States, President Donald J. Trump.

Donald Trump (37:04):

Hello, everybody. Hello, Pennsylvania. We love Pennsylvania, that are very special. Hello to La Trobe. Oh, I love La Trobe. You know why? The home of Arnold Palmer. This was the home of my friend, Arnold Palmer, and he loved La Trobe. He turned out to be one of the greatest golfers in the world. He started off very, very poor. He had no money, just had a lot of talent and a lot of muscle. He was a strong guy. And his father worked at La Trobe golf course, and he was a laborer there. Actually they called him in those days sod carrier. He’s a very strong man. He carried sod. They didn’t have trucks that trucked it. They had strong people carrying. He was the strongest of them all. And he had a son, but they had no money. And he worked at La Trobe, and they treated him good because he could do more work than anybody else.
(38:02)
And his son had started to grow up and he realized his son was very strong like him, but he never had a chance to play golf. He had no money at all. And his son was named Arnold. And when Arnold was four and five years old, they had no money to buy a club. He couldn’t buy one club, not one. And they used to go to the back of… This was all told to me by Arnold, so I have it firsthand. They used to go to the back room where the members were and they took out members’ clubs and they’d use the members’ clubs, two or three of them at night, late at night. And he hit balls with his son and he’d watch his son’s every move. And he realized his son had great talent. And then his son got older and stronger, and then he got stronger and stronger.
(38:48)
And his father started saying, “Wow, this is really crazy, what’s going on with this kid.” And finally he was able to save up enough money to get him some clubs, but they weren’t strong enough. Arnold was breaking them. He’d swing a regular club and it’d break the hell out of it because he was so powerful. And they went back to the members’ bags because they couldn’t afford another set and used very stiff shafted clubs, very strong for those of you that aren’t golfers. That’s for good golfers with power, very stiff shafted. And he’d get better and better. And then he went to high school and he won all sorts of championships, one after another. He’d beat the rich kids, he’d kill them. He’d beat them so badly. He loved beating them, even though he was a nice guy but he was tough. He was a tough cookie, Arnold.
(39:35)
I got to know him really well, and he’d beat them over and over again. And then he got a set of clubs and he got even better. And he won every championship. And he got into Wake Forest. You know that, right? Wake Forest. And he was immediately, as a freshman, the captain of the team. And there was a man named Mark McCormick. And Mark McCormick founded IMG. That’s one of the biggest entertainment companies in the world today. And he wanted to be a professional golfer. He didn’t go to Wake Forest, he went to another college, another school, and I won’t say which, because honestly I didn’t want to look it up. It wasn’t worth it, but a good golf college. And he wanted to be a pro. He was a very good golfer, very, very good. And he had the privilege of playing Arnold Palmer in a match between Wake Forest and his college.
(40:29)
And the way he tells it, he was playing fantastically well, Mark McCormick, a very famous man actually, founder of the biggest entertainment company. And he was playing very well, playing Arnold. Arnold was just Arnold. He was just better than anybody else in college. And somebody shouted over to Mark McCormick, “How are you playing?” He said, “I’m playing great. Can’t play better.” “How are you doing?” “I’m six down.” And he realized at the end of that match that he would never be a pro because he could never beat a guy like this. It wasn’t close. He said, “He was longer, straighter, chipped better, putted better, and thought better. Other than that, they were very close.” But he gave it up. He said, “I’m not going to be a golfer,” but he went to Arnold. He said, “Arnold, you’re going to be turning pro and you’re going to make a lot of money. And my second choice was to start representing people that are talented and I’d like you to be my first client.”
(41:33)
And they made a deal where Arnold owned a big piece of the company and Arnold started winning immediately, started winning immediately, made a lot of money for him. And Mark McCormick became the agent. And then because of Arnold’s success, IMG, which most of you know, it’s very, very big now, Hollywood stars, everything, IMG became well-known. And he started signing a lot of other players and a lot of other people. And then he started with Hollywood and they signed Hollywood stars. And it became the biggest of those companies like William Morris and all of them. And it was all because of Arnold. Arnold owned a big piece of it. Arnold was a very rich man. And I said to Arnold… I got to know him when he was 69 years old.
(42:18)
And I played pretty much with him, a lot of them. And as he got older… When you get older, you start to lose a thing called distance. And I’m a good golfer. Not like that but I’m a good golfer. And I felt so good because I was hitting it a little bit longer than Arnold. But he was by this time about 75, 76, and I’d hit it four or five yards past him. I said, “Arnold, let me ask you, 30 years ago, 40 years ago, was I longer than you?” He said, “Donald…” I wasn’t president or close at that time. That was long before I decided to have this fun.
(42:58)
But you’re talking about a great man. I said, “Arnold…” And he was still plenty long, but I said, “Arnold, do you think I was longer than you like I am now 30, 40 years ago?” He goes, “Donald, let me tell you a little secret. You weren’t even close.” He said, “You see that tree out there?” He pointed to a tree that was about 70 yards in front of us. He said, “That’s where I would drive it. And you’re about 70 yards short of that tree. You would’ve been even worse then.” And it’s true. He won, I think it was Pine Valley, one of the great courses. He won the US Open. He drove a par four, only person ever to drive that hole until that time. He drove it in a playoff, to win the playoff. He went over the trees, very risky shot.
(43:53)
He ended up driving the green and he won with a birdie in the hole. And nobody till that point had done anything like it. But I said to Arnold… He became very rich because of the investments and the IMG and all of the different things. And I said to Arnold, “Just out of curiosity, you could live anywhere in the world. You could live on the Pacific Ocean, you could live on the Atlantic Ocean, you could live anywhere in the world. Why did you choose to stay?” And part of the beauty is that because he made money right away… A lot of times it takes a pro years before they start making the money. It’s a very, very difficult sport actually. But he started right away making money, and the first thing he bought was La Trobe Golf Club. And you know the first thing he did? He took his father from a laborer to make him the course superintendent.
(44:51)
How cool is that? And then ultimately his father became the manager of the club. And Arnold was so proud, and his father was good. He said, “One thing with my father, nobody’s going to steal on me.” He said that. And I said that too. I said, “There’s something nice.” And then I took Arnold when he was quite old in all fairness… We took a helicopter from where he was in Florida to Doral. I own Doral, which is a great place. And it’s got four courses, many championships. Many of the best championships were at Doral. And I was building these beautiful… They call them villas, about 88 units in each one, hotel Villas. And I named them after the 10 greatest golfers, including like Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Slammin’ Sammy Snead, all great players. And I said, “Arnold, I really want to name one after you. Would you like it?”
(45:54)
He said, “I’d love it. I’d be honored to have that.” And we flew down for the opening ceremony to cut a ribbon for the Arnold Palmer Villa. And to this day, people just love it. And I’ll never forget the day, he was having a little hard time. He was a little older. He hit the eighties. He hit the eighties, but when he got up there, he had that magic like nobody had. And there were a few golfers that could… You could say maybe slightly better, a few, not many, but there was nobody that had his magic. He was a thriller. He was unbelievable. He knew how to win and he knew how to just do whatever it was that electrified a crowd. If I had him here right now with me, this crowd would be going absolutely crazy.
(46:48)
They’d say, “Trump, get off the stage. We want Arnold Palmer to speak.” He would electrify a crowd and he would go for shots that nobody else could do and they were risky as hell. And sometimes it wouldn’t work out, but usually it did with him. He was an incredible man. He was an incredible champion. And he came from La Trobe. And so when I said… A couple of days ago, I said, “Where are we going to be today?” They said, “Sir, we’re going to be at La Trobe.” I said, “Do you know what that means?” “No, sir. What does it mean?” I said, “That means Arnold Palmer,” because Arnold told me he could be, and I knew he could be. They wanted him everywhere. Just like I wanted to name a villa after him. Everybody wanted him. He could have been in any place he wanted.
(47:32)
He said, “No, this is where I want to be. This is the place I love. I mean, how good is that, right? And he died a very proud owner of this course. And he was always tinkering with it. I said, “Arnold, what are you doing?” He said, “Well, I’m moving the whole four yards back.” I said, “Nobody knows the difference, Arnold.” He said, “I don’t care. I love it. I love this place.” He could not get enough of La Trobe. So I’ve been here before, and I told the story before, not in this kind of detail, because you have these teleprompters. If I would read it off a teleprompter, it wouldn’t be so good and it would be a lot shorter. It wouldn’t be as good. And I didn’t want to do that. I said, “When I come here, I’m going to tell them the real story of Arnold.”
(48:18)
But Arnold Palmer was all man. And I say that in all due respect to women, and I love women, but this guy, this is a guy that was all man. This man was strong and tough. And I refuse to say it, but when he took showers with the other pros, they came out there, they said, “Oh my God, that’s unbelievable.” I had to say it. We have women that are highly sophisticated here, but they used to look at Arnold, this is bad, but he was really something special. Arnold was something special. So I just want to tell you, you’re very lucky, the people that live in La Trobe, and it’s an honor for me to be here because of him. Actually, he was a great man. And I don’t think there would be golf… To the extent that you have it today, it probably wouldn’t be that way without the great Arnold Palmer. So enjoy it, everybody.
(49:27)
And I had to tell you the shower part of it, because it’s true. What can I tell you? We want to be honest. We want to be upfront. It’s true. But I’m thrilled to be back in this incredible Commonwealth with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. I’d like to begin by asking a question. Are you better off now than you were four years ago after living through this nightmare of inflation, invasion, and humiliation? You know what the invasion is, right? Invasion by the southern border. What they’ve done to our country is unbelievable, allowing more than 21 million people into our country. Many of them are murderers, many of them are drug dealers, and they’re from mental institutions. He says, “Send the back.” You right. Do you come from the drug business? Yeah, he does. But Americans are ready to be free from Kamala Harris.
(50:29)
Do you know that whenever I use the word Harris, everybody says, “Who’s Harris?” They have no idea who Harris is. That’s true. They have no idea who’s Harris but Kamala… And to reclaim the future that is rightfully yours, you’re going to reclaim it. This election is a choice between whether we will have a incredible four more years of failure, such a horrible four years. Everything they touched turns to… Everything, inflation, Afghanistan… How about Afghanistan? Most embarrassing moment in the history of… Everything they’ve touched. Even now, he’s telling Israel… Everything he said to Israel was exactly the opposite. He’s the greatest… I will say this about Biden. He’s the single greatest expert on foreign policy in history. You know what that means? If you did the exact opposite of what he suggested every single time, you’d go down as the greatest foreign policy president in history, if you did the exact opposite. Everything’s a failure.
(51:50)
And he’s telling Bibi, Netanyahu, “Don’t do this. Don’t do that. Don’t do this. All our great congressmen are there. Don’t do any of these things.” And Bibi didn’t listen to him. And I tell you what, they’re in a much stronger position now than they were three months ago, that’s for sure. Nobody’s ever seen anything like this happen. And Bibi called me today and he said, “It’s incredible what’s happened.” I said, “It’s pretty incredible.” But he wouldn’t listen to Biden because if he did, they wouldn’t be in this position. And she’s worse than him. She’s not as smart as him. And I’m not saying he’s the smartest. I’m not saying he’s the smartest, but she’s not as smart as him. And I think maybe based on early results, maybe he’d be doing better than her. We have results coming out where we actually now don’t have to rely on the polls.
(52:44)
We are doing good on the polls, but we don’t have to rely on the polls. Remember, they stole the election from an American president. They stole it. I could say… I don’t even want to call it, they just stole the election. They said, “We’re taking the election away.” He got 14 million votes and he won. 22 people running, 22 Democrats, they’re running. I’m looking at my hair up there. Let’s see. I don’t like it. I don’t like it. Excuse me, I’m going to recomb my hair. Do you mind? I’ll leave the stage for five minutes. I’m going to recomb my hair, Mr. Future Senator. We have David down here, Mr. Future Senator. You’ve got to get him in.
(53:23)
You’re doing good too. Well, let’s keep it the way it is. Let’s just keep going, right? We’ll trudge through it. But this election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of failure and disaster. And that’s what it’s been. It’s been failure. We’re disrespected all over the world. They’re laughed at all over the world. They’re laughing at him and they’re laughing at her. The other night, they had Catholic charities. They had the biggest event, the Al Smith Dinner. It’s the biggest event of the year for Catholics. And she’s the only one in years, decades that didn’t show up. She didn’t show up. She wouldn’t be there.
(54:19)
She wouldn’t be there. She said no, and she ended up doing a tape that was pathetic and it was an insult to Catholics frankly because she was actually sort of knocking them or knocking religion. Then she had the other event the other day where she said, “You’re in the wrong location,” when they started talking about a certain subject, which basically was a knock on Christianity and a knock on religion because she doesn’t know what the hell she’s saying. But they had been a failure. It’s been a disaster. Or you’re going to have four years and they will be the four greatest years in the history of our country if we make the proper decision. You’ve got to make that decision.
(55:20)
Thank you. Thank you very much. By the way, if you’re Catholic, you can’t vote after that and you can’t vote for another reason. That administration has been persecuting Catholics. It’s been persecuting Catholics. I don’t know why. Persecuting a lot of people. Persecuting politicians. I’ll raise my hand, but we’re kicking their ass. They are bad. They are bad. They are bad. Guy is going to jail. They’ve never done this. This has never happened. It happens in third-world countries, in Banana Republics. They go after… It’s called weaponization. They weaponize their justice departments. I call it the Department of Injustice. Ours is the Department of Injustice, but we’re doing well. We won the big case in Florida. You saw that? That was the big one. That was the big one. That was the big one.
(56:19)
They’re going to get him on that one. Oh, they’re going to get him. We had a judge who was brilliant and fair and very smart. She ruled against them, very strongly against them. These are dishonest people that we’re dealing with, but we won that. And we have other ones. We have them on the ropes. Remember, they were going to have me in oh such a trouble. I’m going to be in trouble. And in the meantime, it’s just weaponization of government. That made me more popular. It actually made me more popular, I think. That’s crazy.
(56:49)
Because people can see, and they’re smart, and we could sometime explain it, but one after another… You had Fani, F-A-N-I, which is usually pronounced Fanny, and she added a little action to it, Fani. That was a scam. They’re all scams. They’re all scams. It’s a corrupt system, and it’s a corrupt justice department, and it’s a corrupt DA, corrupt Attorney Generals. They use it to get elected because you can’t get elected with open borders, with transgender operations all over the place, with men playing in women’s sports, with high taxes and banned schools. No school choice. You can’t get elected with all… I could go on for 10 minutes. Your vote will decide whether we give up on America or whether we save America. It is the most important election you’re ever going to have. Really is. By the way, how nice is this place? Isn’t it beautiful? Look, people, as far as you can see, they give you a little extra security nowadays, you notice? Hey, I got more machine guns than I’ve ever seen in… Look at these guys. I got more machine.
(58:21)
I never saw guns like that. I said to my son, Don… He knows a lot about guns, and Eric knows a great shot. They really understand. I said, “What kind of a gun is that?” They said, “Dad, you don’t even want to know.” They are serious guns. We’ve got more guys and everyone who’s like central casting too. Holy shit, I’m looking. They look like Arnold Palmer. They look like Arnold. Can’t look better than Arnold. But with your support, we’ll bring back our nation’s strength, dominance, prosperity, and pride. We’re going to do it. This will be America’s new golden age. 100 years from now, the presidential election of 2024 will be looked upon as America’s greatest victory. I hope that’s true because we’ve been through so much together, and the finish line is finally in sight. After four horrendous years, Kamala Harris can’t say one thing that she’d do differently.
(59:47)
You heard that. If you vote for me, I will end inflation, I will bring jobs back to our country. We’ll flood our shores with companies and jobs. We’ll seal our borders immediately and we’ll let people in. We had the safest border in the history of our country. Hold it, put up my favorite sign of all time, put up my favorite graph. I have to use it, my favorite graph. So the red arrow on the bottom, that’s the lowest number of illegal immigrants to come into this country. And by the way, we want people to come into the country, but they have to come in legally just so we understand, right? She’s going, “Yeah.” We want it, we need them because we’re going to need them because we’re going to have so many companies come in just through adjustments in tariffs and taxes. They’re going to be pouring into our country, and they’re going to stay here because we’re going to protect them with tariffs.
(01:00:49)
The word tariff is the most beautiful word in the dictionary. More beautiful than love. More beautiful than respect. No less beautiful than religion, though. I don’t want to get into that argument, but the word tariff is the most beautiful word in the dictionary. Remember that. It’s going to make our country rich and our politicians were too stupid for so many years or something else was going on. He goes, “Crooked.” That could be. Because it’s so simple to understand, but look at that. So that was the day I left office, that lower red arrow. That’s the lowest point. And look what happened to our country after that. Look at that.
(01:01:40)
And that was done by Border Patrol, which we love. Oh, by the way, Border Patrol gave us their total and complete endorsement, and it’s hard. They’re not actually supposed to do it. They said, “Well, let them take all 29,000 of us and let’s see what happens to this country.” No, they’re not… In theory, you work for the government. They couldn’t help. And they said, “She’s horrible.” They said, “She’s horrible.” They said, “You’re the greatest president in the history of our country.” Some only said, “The greatest in our lifetime.” They had a unanimous endorsement from everybody. And they said at the same time, “She’s the worst we’ve ever had by far.” And now she’s running. And I tell you, I think that the border… I was just saying to Byron Donald in the plane. Right, Byron? I was just in up, Byron, what a great guy.
(01:02:39)
Look at that black hat. So you know what? You know who the founder of that hat is? Elon. Elon Musk. He’s like the founder. We sell that. I think we sell about two a year. Now it’s the hottest hat we have. And Elon came up… Elon Musk gave us his total endorsement. How good is that? He’s the one that landed that rocket. That rocket came in. I said, “That sucker is not going to make it.” I was actually on the phone talking to somebody. It was crazy. And I’m talking to this person and I’m saying, “Wait a minute. Something’s happening. I got to hold. Just hold it.” I put the phone… And it was a very important person. I’m looking at something on the screen. I’m seeing this 24 story tube come down, and it looked like it was getting… Congressman, it looked like it was getting a little bit close to the gantry, or whatever the hell they call that nowadays. I said, “Oh my God.” And I put the phone down. Very important person, by the way.
(01:03:47)
I won’t tell you who, it’ll be embarrassing, because I never picked up the phone again. I was sitting there for… And because I was the president and because I’m leading, which is probably more important to him, the guy didn’t hang up. He was on the phone, forty-five, fifty minutes waiting. I just saw, “Oh, the phone’s off the hook. Hello, hello.” But I saw this thing come down, this tube, this giant tube, and I put the phone, I said, “Just a second.” I said, “I don’t believe it,” because I had the sound off. I turned the sound up and it came down and I said, “It’s going to crash. Don’t crash.” Actually, at first, I thought it was like a movie or something. I never saw this before, and I’ve seen a lot. And it came down and it was going into… And then all of a sudden you see the fire pouring out of the left side, pushed it over. It landed perfectly, and then it was grabbed by two claws, two giant claws, and they grabbed it like Willie Mays would catch a fly ball in center field, right?
(01:04:47)
That’s the way it was. He was pretty good, Willie. And they came down and I called Elon. I said, “Elon, is that you?” He said, “That was me.” I said, “Can anyone else do that?” “No.” “Can the United States do it?” “No.” ” Can Russia do it, China do it?” “No, nobody can do that.” He said, “They’re 10 years behind.” This guy is great. And he said, “If Donald Trump doesn’t win, it could be the end of democracy in our country, it could be the end of our country.” And you know where he is today? He’s in another part of the Commonwealth. Never ever make the mistake of calling it a state, by the way. It could be career ending. I had a friend that did that, a politician. He used to be a politician. It shouldn’t be that big a deal because a lot of people make that mistake. That’s one I could understand somebody making, but we call it the Commonwealth.
(01:05:39)
But Elon endorsed me. He’s in another part of the Commonwealth, and he’s campaigning now, and he’s got… Actually, he’s got a gold. He’s got a gold cap, but he called it. He was wearing the black hat in Butler, Pennsylvania. We had 101,000 people, Butler, honoring Cory, the fire fighter. Butler, Pennsylvania, we had 101,000 people. It was unbelievable. What a night that was. And we were honoring Cory and two gentlemen who were very badly hurt. We thought they weren’t going to make it, the doctors up there. They have good doctors. These are good doctors. I don’t know if they call them country doctors, but whoever they are, they were good because these were two men that were not the two great supporters who were not supposed to make it. And they made it. And they made it. They’ll be okay. But Cory didn’t make it.
(01:06:35)
And we honored Cory. It was the most beautiful evening. We had a moment of silence, and then we had the bells of Notre Dame, right? Notre Dame playing. And then we had an opera singer who sounded just like Pavarotti. I mean, the guy was unbelievable, he sang Ave Maria, and our whole place was crying. It was crazy. I’m looking at the audience. Some of my friends were there, almost as tough as the football players that we have. We have some of the great football players. Almost as tough. I don’t know if you guys did, but they were tough cookies, and I see them crying. They’re trying to be cool. “No, I wasn’t crying,” but the whole place was crying. It was amazing. It was 101,000 people.
(01:07:20)
So we will regain our sovereignty, we’ll restore our safety, and we will unlock the magnificent destiny that is just within our reach. And I am asking you to be excited about the future of our country. Again, you’re going to be excited. This is going to be the most exciting period ever. Every problem facing us can be solved, but now the fate of our nation is in your hands. It really is. I mean, if you put these lunatics in charge any longer, we can’t take it any longer. They’re laughed at. They’re laughed at by foreign leaders. They can’t even believe it. They can’t even believe it. Biden

Donald Trump (01:08:01):

… can’t find his way off a platform. She’s worse. I wonder if she’s going to have any trouble. No, she should be probably okay in that regard. But she’s worse up here. Pennsylvania, you have to stand up and you have to tell Kamala Harris, who shouldn’t be there, she shouldn’t be. She’s a threat to democracy. The way they took over. They called me a threat to democracy, right? She’s a threat to democracy because she shouldn’t even be the candidate. They should have picked a candidate fairly, not just given her because they want to be politically correct.
(01:08:32)
I mean, whether you like him or not, we had the debate, and his numbers went down. He didn’t have a good night, but that can happen. But that happens. And the numbers go down. And they went down, and they went into them. They said, “We’re not going to let you run. We’re going to take it away.” That’s crazy. Nancy went in, Chuck Schumer went in. Some of the people went in. They took it away from him. They just took it away from him. It’s bad. And that is a threat to democracy if you think about it, right? That’s a real threat to democracy.
(01:09:05)
But you have to tell Kamala Harris. And by the way, I think he would’ve… Let’s see what happens. And I may be wrong, but let’s see what happens. I think he might’ve done better than she’s going to do because all we had to do is expose her as a lunatic left, further left than Pocahontas. Do you know who Pocahontas? Elizabeth Warren. She’s further left than Pocahontas, and I don’t want to get into that stuff, but her mother said she was Indian because she had high cheekbones. That’s what she said.
(01:09:40)
And then she went out and did a test because I was driving her crazy, calling her Pocahontas. So she fell for the trap, and she did a test, and she was so happy, because it came back 1,014th, remember? 1,014th, and that was it. That means I had more Indian blood in me than she had, and I have none. I have none. I’d like to have some. I would like to have some. I’d be honored, but I have more, and I have none. But she was so happy when she got… Think of that. That was what happened. That was the end of her career. That was the end of her presidential run.
(01:10:23)
She was leading for the president. And you got to understand, just these are the people we’re dealing with, she took that Indian heritage and based on the fact, and this is her statement. This is not me. There’s no racist anything in me, not a drop, but this is not me. Her mother told her this, that she had high cheekbones, and therefore she was part Indian. And based on that, she applied to colleges. She applied for jobs, she applied for the US Senate, and everyone’s forgotten that crap right now, but I never forget it.
(01:11:01)
But she went out, and she had the test, and the test was ridiculous, basically. And then I said that I have more than she does, and I would love to. I will tell you, but she’s bad news. But she’s radical, left crazy. What she does to business people is horrible. She’s a horrible person, but she’s radical left and crazy. Bernie is radical left. And this one, Kamala, is further left than them. So you have to tell Kamala Harris that you’ve had enough, that you just can’t take it anymore. We can’t stand you. You are a shit Vice President. The worst. You’re the worst Vice President. Kamala, you’re fired. Get the hell out of here. You’re fired. Get out of here. Get the hell out of here, Kamala. [inaudible 01:12:00] Early voting in Pennsylvania is now underway. Go and vote. Just go and vote. Get out there. And if you’ve not registered to vote, you only have two days left. You have to get out there and register immediately. Does everybody promise they’re going to register? Okay? Boy, look at the crowd. Wow. Wow. Hello, everybody. How did the flyover look? Good? Good. It feels like you’re very close to the ground. I said, “Are we okay here?” It looks like okay from here, but let me tell you, you’re in that plane, that sucker feels low. I’m saying, “I hope everything’s working nicely on that plane.” With your help, 17 days from now, we are going to win Pennsylvania. We’re going to defeat Kamala Harris, and we are going to make America great again, right?

Speaker 5 (01:13:01):

Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump.

Donald Trump (01:13:18):

And I’m in big trouble tonight. You know why Franklin Graham wrote me. You heard this. Like two months ago. He said, “President, we love your stories. We love your speaking. We love everything about you. You’re a great Christian. We love everything about you, but sir, please, please don’t use any bad language, bad words.” He said, “Your stories will even be better.” And I wrote them back. I said, “I’m going to try and do that, but actually the stories won’t be as good.” Because you can’t put the same emphasis on… So tonight I broke my rule. I’ve done it for weeks, but tonight I just said, “Look, I’m in Pennsylvania. What the hell?” What the hell? I went to school here. I went to school. I went to the great Wharton School of Finance here. What a great school that was too. What a great school. So if we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole damn thing, right?
(01:14:20)
And starting on day one of my new administration, I will end Kamala Harris’ war on Pennsylvania energy because you know she’s going to ban fracking, right? A 100%. She was against fracking, against all this stuff, and then all of a sudden, about a year and a half ago when she was getting killed in the polls, she said, “I like fracking very much.” Look, they always go back to what they want. They always go back. She can’t help it. She’s a radical left Marxist. She can’t help it. But we’re going to end that, and we will frack, frack, frack, and drill, baby, drill.
(01:15:01)
We’re going to drill, baby, drill. We’re going to be drilling so deep. We’re going to be for these guys. We’re going to drill. We’re going to take out so much money. We’re going to pay down our debt. We’re going to lower your taxes. I gave you the largest tax cut in the history of our country and the biggest regulation cuts in the history of our country. And we had the best economy in the history of our country, and we had the best border in the history of our country.
(01:15:32)
Other than that, what the hell? I did other things too. I rebuilt the military, and unfortunately, they gave a lot of it away to the Taliban. These geniuses, these stupid people like Milley, General Milley. Remember his performance in Congress? General Milley and Mattis, all these guys, what a bunch of lightweights. But we have great generals, but they’re the ones you don’t see on television. They’re the ones that actually have to fight. Like we defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate with great generals and great… We have a great military, but not the ones you see on television. Not the movie actors that you see. Kamala has said repeatedly, she wants to ban fracking, which would kill over 500,000 jobs in Pennsylvania alone. Watch this.

Speaker 6 (01:16:23):

There’s no question I’m in favor of ban fracking. I’m committed to passing a Green New Deal and finally putting an end to fracking once and for all.
(01:16:31)
If they fail to act as President of the United States, I’m prepared to get rid of the filibuster to pass a Green New Deal. I’m offering a Green New Deal that has been described as one of the most aggressive and progressive.

Speaker 7 (01:16:46):

[inaudible 01:16:47] bring the Green New Deal up for a vote?

Speaker 6 (01:16:49):

I would vote for it. It’s a resolution. I believe that the underlying principles behind it are sound and important.

Speaker 7 (01:16:53):

What is the solution for voters who have jobs and interests in the fossil fuel industry?

Speaker 6 (01:17:04):

Giving the workers an ability to transition into the jobs of the future afforded.

Speaker 7 (01:17:09):

Can we afford it?

Speaker 6 (01:17:09):

Of course we can afford it. It’s not about cost.

Donald Trump (01:17:11):

So when she does that, that’s the end of Pennsylvania as we know it. It’s your most important, not only from the standpoint of 500,000 jobs, it’s 500,000 jobs, but in terms of income for the state, you would have to double and triple your taxes to make up. And she’s going to do it. She’s going to do it. She’s going to do it.
(01:17:40)
And you know, the other thing, the taxes. You know what an unrealized capital gain is? Okay? I’ll tell you what it is, communism is what… So she wants to have a tax. So capital gains tax is terrible, it’s rough, but you sell something, you can pay the tax. She wants an unrealized capital gain every year so that if something goes up in value, now you have to go out. It’ll be a great business for appraisers and for lawyers and for accountants. Other than that, it’s a disaster. She wants an unrealized, and she refuses to say that, “No, we’re not going to do that.” She refuses. Think of it. It’s an unrealized gain. She wants that. So she wants to tax an unrealized gain. This woman is crazy.
(01:18:29)
I will terminate the green new scam immediately. It’s the greatest scam in history. I’ll stop the energy price hikes. I will rescind the natural gas export ban, which is killing your state, by the way, and we will have energy independence. We were energy independent four years ago. Think of it, energy independent. We’re still going to be energy dominant, and I will cut your energy and electricity prices in half within 12 months of taking office, 50%. We have it. It’s under our feet. We don’t have to get it from Venezuela. We get it from Venezuela. The whole thing’s not believable.
(01:19:10)
For most of American history, Pennsylvania was the commercial and industrial powerhouse of the United States, but year after year, globalist radical politicians and incompetents like Kamala Harris have waged a war on your Commonwealth. They’ve annihilated your steel mills, decimated your coal jobs, assaulted your oil and gas jobs, and sold off your manufacturing jobs to China and foreign nations all over the world.
(01:19:41)
Under the Trump administration, we are going to take back what is ours. We will end the looting and pillaging of Pennsylvania and many other states all over our country. We will bring back our manufacturing jobs, our energy jobs, our coal jobs, our steel jobs, and our dreams.
(01:20:05)
And it’s all very simple. Starting in January, we will give our companies the lowest taxes, the lowest energy costs, the lowest regulatory burdens and free access to the best and biggest market anywhere on the planet. But only if they make their products right here in America. If they don’t, they have to pay a higher [inaudible 01:20:28] and only if they hire American workers for the job, and they will. They’ll all be coming. They’ll be pouring in. If these companies don’t make their product here, then they will pay a tariff when they send their products into the United States for the privilege of competing with our workers and our cherished companies. We’re going to protect our workers and our company. It’s all very simple. We don’t do any of this now.
(01:20:50)
I was going to do it, and then COVID came, and I said, “We got to fight that one.” We did a great job with that. I got great credit for the economy, for the military. We were in no wars. Think of it. I started no wars. Everybody thought I’d be in a war. I’ll be in a war in two days. No, it didn’t work out. My personality stopped wars. Stopped wars. It stopped wars in countries that we weren’t even involved. I was able to stop wars with other countries that we weren’t even that involved with just by making a couple of phone calls. I saved a lot of lot of lives.
(01:21:26)
We will call this policy the Build It in America plan because when foreign leaders and CEOs call me up to complain about our tariffs, my answer will be very simple to them, “Build it in America, build it in Pennsylvania.” We’re going to build a lot. We’re going to have all those hulks that you have all over the place, the big empty hulks that we have all over our country. They’re going to be loaded up with companies. Honestly, they’ll be ripped down, and you’ll see modern buildings built, modern manufacturing built. The centerpiece of this plan will be a 15% made-in-America corporate tax rate, cutting the tax from 21% to 15, but again, only for those who make their product in the USA. And remember, I got it down to 21. Everyone said it would be impossible to get approved by Congress. I got it approved by Congress, but I got it down to 21. It was close to 40%. I got it down to 21%. Nobody thought that was possible. Now, I’m taking it from 21% down to 15%. The companies are going to roar in because 21% is very competitive. 15% is really, it’s amazing.
(01:22:45)
I mean, companies are going to want to be here, but they have to be protected from other companies coming in from the outside and raiding the jobs, the products. And that’s what we’re doing with the tariffs. And for those companies who don’t make their product in America, they will be forced to pay a very stiff tariff. And we will make it and take it. Hundreds of billions of dollars are going to come in through tariff dollars to benefit American citizens, and we’re going to pay off debt and reduce your taxes still further.
(01:23:15)
Again, I gave you the biggest tax cut in history. We’ll be able to do it still further. And remember this, for decades, nobody paid. China never paid one penny, not one penny to us until I came along. They paid hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and taxes under me. Under Bush, under Obama, they never paid. They never paid anything, nothing, not a dime. Hundreds of billions of dollars they paid. And that’s just the beginning.
(01:23:51)
We’re a rich country, but we don’t know how to be rich. We just don’t know how to be. But we’re going to be rich, and we’re going to be richer than ever before. We’re going to take care of ourselves. It’s going to be America first. It’s also going to be, we’ll help the world. We want to help the world, but it’s time that we take care of ourselves. We owe $36 trillion dollar. We’re going to take care of ourselves first.

Speaker 5 (01:24:09):

USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.

Donald Trump (01:24:09):

And I will never apologize for defending America. I will protect our workers. I will protect our jobs. I will protect our borders. I will protect our families, and I will protect the birthright of our children to live in the richest and most powerful nation on the face of [inaudible 01:24:40].
(01:24:39)
And I will also protect our steel industry. If you guys remember, we were going to lose our steel. We had the worst policy on steel. China was coming in and others, dumping steel onto our shores. And we would’ve had no steel industry left. And I put a tariff, a big tariff on all steel coming in. It was not good steel either. It was what we call dirty steel. It was bad steel, bad structurally, very dangerous, actually. But they were dumping steel into our country, destroying our steel mills. And I put a big tariff, and it all stopped. when I did that, it all stopped. And we took in hundreds of billions of dollars, and it all stopped.
(01:25:24)
And we slashed foreign steel exports. All these exports that were pouring in, they stopped to the level of about 25%. Nobody could believe it. And I hadn’t even started yet. We were just getting ready. We were going to make this country richer than it had ever been before. In the 1890s and 1880s, our country was actually the richest it ever was. They had to form committees to determine, how are we going to spend this vast wealth? We had so much wealth, relatively speaking, so much wealth, more than anybody by far. And they formed up blue ribbon committees. “How are we going to spend the money? We don’t know how to spend it.” Wouldn’t that be a nice problem to have?
(01:26:12)
We were a tariff country. And McKinley was President. William McKinley was actually a great president, was assassinated, by the way. He was assassinated. Being president is a very dangerous profession. If you’re an auto racer, you know how many people die? About one-tenth of 1%. If you’re a bull rider, that’s dangerous. That’s more dangerous than playing in the NFL, right, fellas, what do you think? I think it’s a little more. I don’t know. It’s pretty dangerous. We got a couple of big, big deals over here, but I think that bull riding stuff, that looks bad. One-tenth of 1% about the same as the auto racing.
(01:26:50)
If you’re president, take a look, it’s about 5%, 6%. That’s a lot better. But it’s only good if you want to do one thing. You want to make your country strong and wonderful and great, and that’s what I’m doing. But it is a dangerous profession, and we can’t let it be a dangerous profession. We have to have better everything.
(01:27:15)
Actually, we have to have better respect from countries that look at us because we have to let them… I’m still waiting for Biden to say, “If you do anything to this guy that I hate, I hate Trump. But if you do anything to him, we’re going to blow your country to pieces.” And then you wouldn’t need all this glass up here. You wouldn’t need all the glass.
(01:27:37)
And other presidents have said that. And even if it’s your opponent, and even if it’s somebody that helped them force you out of an election, which I didn’t want to do, but you got to do that, regardless. Opponent or no opponent, you got to let a country know that you’re going to play around, we’re going to blow you to pieces, and then everything will stop. It’ll be amazing.
(01:27:57)
But today I’m honored to receive the endorsement of three union locals representing US steel, Mon Valley. And if they want, I’d like to call them up to the stage, including union leaders, Brian Pavlak and Richard TK, and Jason Zugeis. Would you come on up here, fellas? These are good-looking people. Good-looking guy. Yeah. [inaudible 01:28:38].

Speaker 17 (01:32:03):

Good luck, President Trump.

Speaker 14 (01:32:03):

Save our steel.

Donald Trump (01:32:07):

Thank you very much. Thank you very much. They said you did stay. We really did. We saved the steel industry in this country. Now we’re going to make it really powerful again, along with autos. Great guys, great people. Those are great people. And that have been beaten up for a lot of years unfairly because we had stupid politicians or corrupt politicians, I’m not sure which.
(01:32:32)
I’m also honored to have the overwhelming endorsement of the rank-and-file membership of the Teamsters. That never happened before, never happened before, never happened before. And also we have something else, the law enforcement. Virtually every group in the United States from law enforcement, every single group. The sheriffs, the police, the Fraternal Order, 400,000 police, they all endorsed me, so thank you very much. Thank you. I don’t think she has one. She’s a disaster. She want to defund. She was involved in defund the police. I think when you defund the police, that’s the end of that.
(01:33:20)
With four more years of Kamala, Harris, Pennsylvania will be an economic wasteland. That’s going to happen. And I’ll tell you with me, you’re going to make more money than they’ve ever made before. You’re going to have the best salaries, the lowest taxes. You’re going to be doing better than you ever did. And we’re going to put this into motion fast. You can do it very fast. It’s very simple too. Kamala’s inflation has already cost the typical family over $30,000 in higher prices, and now she wants to raise typical family taxes by nearly $3,000 a year. Just take a look at this video please.

Speaker 18 (01:34:01):

Kamala Harris is going to significantly raise taxes.

Speaker 6 (01:34:04):

Taxes are going to have to go up.

Speaker 18 (01:34:06):

Kamala’s plan will raise families’ taxes by nearly $2,600 a year. Under Kamala, prices have already soared. Now she’d make it worse with even higher taxes.

Speaker 6 (01:34:17):

Taxes are going to have to go up.

Speaker 18 (01:34:19):

President Trump will cut taxes again. No taxes on tips, overtime, or Social Security.

Donald Trump (01:34:28):

I’m Donald J. Trump, and I approve this message. You know what they said to me up here? “We like the overtime the best.” I said, “yeah, [inaudible 01:34:39]” You like the overtime, right fellas? That’s it. I figured you had something. That’s right. You’re not worried about the tips. You like that overtime, right? But a lot of people like the tips. And if you’re a senior, you know what you like. You want the Social Security, no tax on Social Security. Think of no tax. No tax on Social Security benefits for our seniors. And they deserve it because you know what? Inflation with their fixed income, mostly fixed income, inflation has absolutely destroyed our seniors and other people that are on fixed income. So I will also make interest on car loans fully tax-deductible. That’s a big deal.
(01:35:21)
They said, one of the top guys on Wall Street called up and he said, “We have an incredible situation here. Where did you come up with that?” It’s like the paperclip. I said it the other day, like 125 years ago, some guy took some steel and he bent it around a little bit. He came up with a paperclip and other people looked at it. He made a lot of money, very rich man. And they said, “Why the hell didn’t we think of it?” The one having to do with the deductibility of car loans, so simple. And the top guys on Wall Street, real geniuses, they called up. They said, “How did you think of that? It’s so simple.” But to have the American dream, you want to have a car, and I think this is going to be fantastic for Detroit and South Carolina and Tennessee and all of the areas that produce cars.
(01:36:11)
One thing I have to say, also. We have, in Mexico, and I’ve been talking about it for the last year and a half. China is getting ready to build massive car plants, massive, which would wipe out Michigan, would hurt you, but would wipe out Michigan. Detroit would be gone. And they’re the biggest plants in the world. I have a friend that does that. He builds plants. He doesn’t do anything else. All he wants to do is build plants. And I called him up a year ago, a little more than that. I said, “I want to see a plant. I want to go see a plant.” You think Biden calls people up and says, “I’d like to see a plant?” I don’t think so. He wants to go to sleep, and she wants to do other things. We don’t know what they are. We’ll find out, unfortunately.
(01:36:54)
No, but I said, “I want to see a plant.” He said, “Well, I can’t really take you to the US because we’re not building the good ones, but the big ones are being built in Mexico.” I said, “What do you mean, Mexico?” They’re being built by China, and they’re the biggest in the world, actually. One plant will be doing more than all of Michigan. So I said, “This is not good.”
(01:37:15)
And then they think they’re going to take the cars, build them, and sell them over to the United States, or go around the little horn and sell them to the United States, and destroy our automobile. And it would. It would destroy. So I said, “I’ve had it,” and I started talking about tariffs. We’re going to put massive tariffs on these companies that are coming in and destroying our jobs and our companies.
(01:37:39)
And so I went very public with it for the last four months about tariffs. I love tariffs. I love tariffs. What they can do for you, income and protection, and even third-party things you can do just by the threat of tariffs. Because we’re the pot of gold. We won’t be the pot of gold long if we don’t do something. So I was making a speech the other day in Detroit at the Economic Club, which is a great place, beautiful. And talking about cars, and I saw the man that is the great car factory builder who I know, John, I won’t give his full name, but John. And I saw him and I said, “Could I see you after the speech?” I made the speech. I went to see him. I said, “How are those plants coming, the big ones in China?” They said, “Sir, they just canceled them because they think you’re going to get elected, and they don’t want to build them because they won’t be able to pay tariffs.”
(01:38:33)
We just canceled them. I didn’t even do anything, and I just saved Detroit. I just saved every car-making state. No, but think of it. And I thought to myself, “Just the threat of tariffs, they canceled these multi-billion dollar auto factories,” auto machines is what they really are. Now, will I get credit for that? I don’t think so, but we know. But he just said, “Because of you, they think you’re going to get elected. They think you’re going to charge tariffs that are so much that it won’t be possible for them to survive.” And China just canceled those big, beautiful factories that would’ve destroyed our country in terms of auto making. And I think it’s great. And now people are starting to see it. They’re saying, “That was a pretty good thing to do.” I didn’t even do anything. Just a mere threat of that beautiful word kept what we have.
(01:39:32)
Don’t forget, a lot of it’s been taken over 50, 60 years. We were the greatest powerhouse. We will have that back soon. I think we can compete with it. We will have that back soon. We’re going to have so many auto plants and so many steel plants built in this country now. So simple too. It’s so simple. And I’ve been talking about this for the last couple of months, and people are starting to understand it. They’re starting to understand it. And China does it. They’ve been doing it for a long time. They say, “We don’t want your cars. If you want to build a car, you build it in our country.”
(01:40:09)
They did it with Harley Davidson in India. They charge a 200% tariff on a motorcycle. They said, “If you want to do this, you have to build it. We don’t want your motorcycles. We’re going to charge you 200. Harley Davidson said, “We don’t sell any in India. Tariff’s too high.” I said, “What are you going to do?” They said, “We’ve got to build a plant over there, sir.” We’re the only one that doesn’t do it because we’re ruled by corrupt and stupid politicians. But we’re doing it now.
(01:40:35)
As we build our economy, we’ll also restore our borders. For four straight years, Kamala has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from prisons and jails. They come from insane asylums and mental institutions and all around the world. They come from Venezuela to the Congo. They come from the Congo now. A lot of them are coming out of the jails of the Congo, and she’s resettled them into our communities, to prey upon our innocent American citizens.
(01:41:09)
No, we’re not going to do that. When I win on November 5th, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins. We’re not going to have it.

Speaker 5 (01:41:19):

Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump.

Donald Trump (01:41:31):

Thank you. And every day, Kamala is using migrant flights and her phone app. Do you believe they have a phone app for the criminal cartels to call up? “Hello, this is Jose Rodriguez. I’d like to know where do I dispose of my illegal migrants?” And they tell you where to drop them. Can you believe it? The only thing worse are the flights.

Donald Trump (01:42:00):

They have planes flying over our border, a big beautiful Boeing, 727, 737s, and just like that beautiful plane over there. Isn’t it a pretty plane? 757, 767s, they have planes flying back and forth, loaded up with migrants only going one way, by the way, to flood Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin, that’s what they’re doing, and the entire Midwest with thousands and thousands of illegal migrants. And many of these are very dangerous people. They’ll look at you, they’ll cut you up, and they won’t even think about it as just one example. The 4,000 person town of Charleroi, Pennsylvania has seen, listen to this, a 2000% increase in the population of illegal migrants. Think of that, 2000% increase in the population of illegal migrants under Harris. She doesn’t want to be called border czar, but you know what? I don’t care. She was in charge of the border. This deficient, this mentally deficient president put her in charge of the border, and she never went there, not once. And she never….
(01:43:24)
When the border patrol last week endorsed me so strongly, I asked them, “How often did you speak to her? You were dealing with her.” They said, “Sir, we never spoke to her once.” I said, “Who did she speak to?” There were like 40 guys on the stage, all the leaders of the border patrol. She said, “Not one of them did she speak to, not one.” Pennsylvania is not going to take it anymore. One of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gangs that Kamala has imported into our country is the savage Venezuelan Prison Gang Tren de Aragua. Has anyone heard of it? You’ve heard of MS-13 these are right in the same category. You don’t get any meaner or tougher, but they’re taking over apartment complexes like I do. I’m in the real estate business also. Isn’t it… They do it differently. They do it with guns. I do it with financing. And unleashing a violent terror spree all across America. This is happening all over. Let’s watch.

Speaker 19 (01:44:30):

Open borders, deadly consequences.

Speaker 20 (01:44:32):

Border crisis. Record high crossings are putting a strain on cities across America.

Speaker 21 (01:44:36):

It’s a full-blown invasion.

Speaker 22 (01:44:40):

Armed Venezuelan gang members storming an effort in complex in Aurora, Colorado.

Speaker 23 (01:44:44):

People talk about crime. This is what they’re talking about.

Speaker 21 (01:44:47):

Biden and Harris has created a program to bring them in on the humanitarian parole.

Speaker 24 (01:44:51):

I am in favor of saying that we’re not going to treat people who are undocumented, cross-borders as criminals.

Speaker 21 (01:44:56):

More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder have been released into the United States.

Speaker 25 (01:45:05):

My 20-year-old daughter, Kayla Hamilton, was murdered in her own room. Kayla’s murderer was apprehended by border patrol crossing illegally into the US.

Speaker 26 (01:45:11):

Kayla’s murderer had been improperly released into the United States.

Speaker 24 (01:45:15):

Abolish ICE. Yeah, we need to probably think about starting from scratch.

Speaker 27 (01:45:20):

An Afghan National was in custody today after being accused of plotting an election day terrorist attack. The suspect entered the US on a special immigrant visa.

Speaker 28 (01:45:27):

More than a dozen people suspected of being Tren de Aragua gang members right here in San Antonio.

Speaker 22 (01:45:30):

The gang members had been terrorizing the apartment complex.

Speaker 29 (01:45:34):

New details in the murder of Laken Riley. The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuelan national.

Speaker 30 (01:45:42):

And was paroled and released into the country by the Biden administration.

Speaker 31 (01:45:46):

Two men investigators say are in the country illegally for Venezuela are charged with capital murder and the death of Jocelyn Nungaray.

Speaker 32 (01:45:52):

Court documents suggest a group of men arrested for beating and robbing a Dallas woman last month are members of a Venezuelan Street gang.

Speaker 33 (01:46:00):

Manuel Hernandez-Hernandez was booked by Colleyville Police just two days earlier and released the day before the robbery.

Donald Trump (01:46:14):

And it’s that way all over America. And I say it’s a much bigger… The polls are saying that the biggest problem is inflation and the economy. I say that’s a bigger problem. I’d move inflation and the economy to number two. That is a bigger problem because that’s destroying the fabric of our country. The United States is now an occupied country, but November 5th, 2024 will be liberation day in America. It’s going to be liberation day. Under Kamala Harris, 13,099 illegal alien convicted murders are on the loose right now in the United States of America. Can you believe it? Just this week, two illegal alien members of the same savage Venezuelan gang were arrested in New York for robbing, shooting, and murdering a 59-year-old man in a Connecticut hotel. One of these illegal alien monsters was a got-away. Do you know what that is? These are the illegal got-aways. And the other was caught, but then released into our country by Kamala Harris and her horrible, horrible free open borders. Immediately upon taking the oath of office, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history.
(01:47:41)
We have no choice. I don’t want to do it. The record right now is Dwight Eisenhower, a moderate president that couldn’t stand… He just couldn’t stand what was happening with the border many years ago. Dwight Eisenhower, General Eisenhower, he’s a good president, but he was a moderate person, but he has every record. He just couldn’t stand watching the borders be crossed by people that weren’t citizens of our country. I will rescue every town across America that has been invaded and conquered, and we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in a jail or kick them out of our country immediately. They will get sent back to where they came from. We have no choice.
(01:48:21)
And to expedite removals of Tren de Aragua and other savage gangs, I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Can you believe that? We couldn’t have an act like that now because now everything’s woke. We have woke generals like Milley and Mattis. We have woke people. They don’t do things like this, so we had to go back to 1798 when we had real people running our country. The Alien Enemies Act of 17 gives us tremendous power to the President to do what’s right, to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil. And if they come back into our country, it’s an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole. So when they come back, if they come back… When they hear that, they won’t come back. And if that’s not good enough, we’ll make it 20. And I’m also calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer, right?
(01:49:43)
Kamala’s invasion is also bankrupting Medicare and Social Security. She wants to give millions of illegals the benefits you work for your entire lives. And by the way, by talking about education, social security, all of the different benefits. That’s why people are pouring up into our country. If you say you’re not going to get it, they won’t come. They’re coming because we say, “Come on up” like that idiot governor from California, Gavin Newsom, Gavin Newsom. Did you see the other day he signed a bill that you are not even allowed to ask a person whether or not they have voter ID. If you ask them, it’s a criminal penalty. If you say, “Sir, I’d like to see your voter ID,” they want to put you in jail for saying that. We are not going to stand… I’m going to get that thing overturned so fast. He just signed the bill. Because we want, ultimately, one-day voting, we want paper ballots, we want voter ID, and we want proof of citizenship, and we’re finished.
(01:50:50)
And we’ll have quick fair elections that will cost 8% of the cost of these very beautiful fancy machines that go up to Mars and around and down and all over the place. You ever see this, where they have machines? We spend all this money in machines, and then they announce we expect to have the results like seven days after the election. If you had paper ballots, you get them at 10 o’clock. France went to paper because what we did didn’t work. The mail-in ballots didn’t work. France had them. And you know what? Didn’t work. There was a lot of theft, a lot of things going on. They went to paper ballots, same-day voting, 38 million votes. Everything was done by 10 o’clock in the evening. No people complaining, nothing. I will protect, for a fraction… By the way, for a fraction of the cost, I will protect our seniors and ensure that federal benefits are for Americans only. I just want them to be only for Americans. Kamala is telling you if you vote for her, it’s four more years of the same. Take a look.

Speaker 34 (01:52:00):

Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?

Speaker 24 (01:52:06):

There has not a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 35 (01:52:08):

We stood there on the tarmac watching you check your watch.

Speaker 36 (01:52:11):

The chaotic and deadly US evacuation from Afghanistan, stunned Americans at the world and cost the lives of 13 US soldiers.

Speaker 34 (01:52:19):

Would you have done something differently?

Speaker 24 (01:52:20):

There is not a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 21 (01:52:21):

More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder and been caught at the board, and then released into the United States.

Speaker 27 (01:52:30):

An Afghan National is in custody today after being accused of plotting an election-day terrorist attack. The suspect entered the US on a special immigrant visa.

Speaker 29 (01:52:38):

Gut-wrenching new details in the murder of Georgia. Nursing student Laken Riley. The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuelan national who crossed the unsecured southern border back in 2022.

Speaker 31 (01:52:51):

Two men investigators say are in the country illegally from Venezuela on charges of capital murder and the death of Jocelyn Nungaray.

Speaker 37 (01:52:58):

A fifth illegal immigrant accused of attacking two New York City police officers over the weekend showed no remorse or regret.

Speaker 34 (01:53:06):

Would you have done something differently?

Speaker 24 (01:53:07):

There is not a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 38 (01:53:11):

Only 18% said the economy is in excellent or good condition.

Speaker 39 (01:53:14):

US inflation has hit a new 40-year high, increasing by 9.1% over the financial year.

Speaker 40 (01:53:20):

The cost of homes have spiked. Home buyers need to earn 80% more than they did in 2020 to afford a house.

Speaker 34 (01:53:28):

Were you the last person in the room?

Speaker 24 (01:53:28):

Yes.

Donald Trump (01:53:32):

That’s it. You’d do nothing different than the worst administration in the history of our country? The happiest person in life, he just turned over 100 years old now, he’s over 100, he turned a few weeks ago, Jimmy Carter, he’s the happiest man around. You know why? Because he looks brilliant compared to this administration. The Carter administration is brilliant compared to these people. He didn’t destroy our country at the border. Pennsylvania, if you want to end this disaster, you must get out and vote. You have to go and vote. Get everybody you can. And ladies and gentlemen, we can start really well. There’s a man. I’m going to call him up real quickly. His name is David McCormick. He’s a great man, been successful at everything. He’s smart, he’s tough. Everything he did turned out to be great, and I think this is going to be just the start. Vote for him for the Senate.
(01:54:33)
Your particular senator right now is a total stiff. Thank you. Who says he’s my best friend. He just announced he’s for me with tariffs. I don’t know the gentleman. This is the guy that’s going to do it, David McCormick.

David McCormick (01:54:51):

Thank you, Mr. president. Well, Mr. President, it all comes down to Pennsylvania. It all comes down to the Keystone state. We’ve got to put you back in the White House so we can have strength and common-sense policies to fight back on this crazy liberal agenda, the weakness of Kamala Harris that has taken us over the cliff. So we’re with you Mr. President, 100%. We’re going to fight for you, but we also got to get a majority in the Senate so we can put those common-sense policies in place. And that’s why we got to retire Bob Casey, 30-year career politician. He’s weak, and he’s voted 100% with the crazy liberal agenda of Biden-Harris. We got to send Bob Casey home. And Mr. President, first time today, I just heard this an hour or two ago, good news, first public poll that says McCormick’s in the lead over Casey. We’re going to win this, but we need to fight, fight, fight for the next 17 days. No sleep. Take our country back. Thank you, Mr. President.

Donald Trump (01:56:02):

Thank you very much, David. David’s a good man. And he’s going to really represent you, and he’s going to work with us on getting your taxes down, et cetera. We’re also joined by representatives, John Joyce, great guy. Where’s John? Hello, John. Dan Meuser, who’s fantastic, my friend, all my friends, and Byron Donalds of Florida. And also, I tell you, if you’re a football fan, these guys are good. I guess they’re going to the game a little bit later or something. Are you going to the game? Are you going or you’re going to watch it on television? Former NFL stars, Antonio Brown. Oh, he was a good player. He was a good player. And Le’Veon Bell, really good players. And Mike Wallace. Come on up, fellas. Come on up.

Speaker 41 (01:57:06):

Let’s vote for Trump, baby. Make some noise for the president.

Speaker 42 (01:57:24):

Let’s go Trump. You already know. Vote Trump. Let’s go.

Speaker 41 (01:57:26):

Here we go, Steelers.

Speaker 43 (01:57:26):

Here we go.

Speaker 41 (01:57:26):

Here we go Steelers.

Speaker 43 (01:57:26):

Here we go.

Speaker 41 (01:57:26):

Thank so much.

Speaker 42 (01:57:26):

See you at the game.

Donald Trump (01:57:44):

Have a good time. Thank you.

Speaker 42 (01:57:44):

Appreciate you.

Donald Trump (01:57:45):

They look good. We’re also deeply honored to be joined by gold star family members of the service members, several of them who gave their lives in Afghanistan. So, so horrible, so horrible that this had to happen. They’re friends of mine. Many of the families are friends of mine. I’ve gotten to know him over this, and it’s just horrible. Should have never happened, would’ve never happened. Corporal Hunter Lopez and his family is here. We’re honoring these people. Corporal Humberto Sanchez, Staff Sergeant Taylor Hoover, Sergeant Nicole G., and Corporal Kareem Nikoui. Thank you very much. Great people. I got to know them very well. Should it never, ever happened. 13, 13 people and many, many so badly injured. We have to talk about them. I talk about them all the time with the legs and the arms and just obliteration. So I want to thank you all very much.
(01:59:06)
Thank you for being here. Thank you. I also want to thank Elon Musk, because when I called him on North Carolina and Georgia, as you know, they had almost no… Especially in North Carolina, they had no communication. The lines were all down a few weeks ago with Hurricane Helene. And I called Elon. They said, “Do you know Elon Musk?” I said, “I happen to know him. What do you want?” “We need Starlink.” I said, “What does Starlink? Tell me, please. Give me a lesson. Tell me.” And they told me, “It’s basically great communication, and up to a satellite and back.” And they said, “We just have to have it. We can’t get it because it’s very hard to get.” And I called Elon and he had it there literally in moments. It was amazing how fast he got it there for them. So I want to thank Elon for doing that. That was great. People of North Carolina. So we’re working very hard for Pennsylvania. But in breaking news, it was just announced that the highly respected Florida judge who is overseeing our case against the Pulitzer Prize Board for awarding their once highly respected prizes to the failing New York Times and the Washington Post. These are really fake news papers. Call them fake news papers, but they’re fake news, Russia, Russia, Russia stories. They got the Pulitzer Prize for Russia, Russia, Russia. Turned out to be a fake story. So I figured, what the hell, on your behalf, I’d sue their off. And he’s ordered discovery to move full speed ahead. He wants it to go. That means that we will be able to learn the full scale of their lies, deceit, and wrongdoing, and we’ll hold these radical lunatics accountable for the lying that they’ve done to the American people. What they’ve done is incredible.
(02:00:59)
Think of it. They got the Pulitzer Prize for their great reporting on Russia, Russia, Russia, and then it turned out to be a hoax, and now everybody knows it. So I want them to return those Pulitzer Prizes, and I think lots of damages should be awarded to a lot of different people. So here are the facts. Kamala Harris is a radical left Marxist rated even worse than Bernie. She destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of defund the police, and anybody who wants to defund it could not be president of the United States. We cherish our police, and we’re going to give them back their respect and their dignity and let them do the job, and crime will fall. Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE. These are tough people. I know a lot of tough people right in this first few rows. They’re not tough like these guys.
(02:01:57)
As California Attorney General, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon, and rape of an unconscious person as totally nonviolent crimes. She pledged to confiscate your guns and endorsed a total ban on handgun ownership. She even called for free sex changes for illegal aliens and detention at taxpayers expense. She lied about working at McDonald’s, a simple thing. I think very soon, maybe tomorrow or something, I’m going to work the french fry.
(02:02:36)
I think I’m doing it tomorrow, and I think it’s in a place in Pennsylvania. And I’m going to stand over that french fry. She lied about her… It’s a very basic thing to say. They’ll say… Oh, look at all that press. That’s lot of press. But they’re going to say, “Oh, it’s so basic.” It is basic, but the basic is easier to understand. She said, as part of a resume, for years, I worked at McDonald’s. It’s probably tough, but she never worked there. It turned out to be a hoax. So on top of all of this, Kamala turned on our military and wants to make them woke. Take a look at our real military. Just take a look at it.

Speaker 44 (02:03:28):

You little scumbag, I’ve got your name. I got your ass. You will not laugh. You will cry. You will learn by the numbers.

Speaker 45 (02:03:35):

Happy pride. Happy pride month. And actually, let’s declare summer of pride.

Speaker 44 (02:03:36):

So you’re a killer

Speaker 46 (02:03:36):

Sir, yes sir.

Speaker 44 (02:03:36):

Let me see your war face.

Speaker 46 (02:03:36):

Sir.

Speaker 44 (02:03:36):

You got a war face? That’s a war face. Now let me see your war face. Bullshit. You didn’t convince me. Let me see your real war face.
(02:03:36)
You will be a weapon. You will be a minister of death. Praise the Lord. But until that day, you are pukes. You are the lowest form of life on Earth. You are not even human fucking beings. You are nothing but unorganized grab-asstic pieces of amphibian shit.
(02:03:36)
It looks to me like the best part of you ran down the crack of your mama’s ass and ended up as a brown stain on the mattress.
(02:03:36)
I love working for Uncle Sam.

Speaker 46 (02:03:36):

I love working for Uncle Sam.

Speaker 44 (02:03:36):

Lets me know just who I am.

Speaker 46 (02:03:36):

Donald Trump (02:04:56):

That wasn’t exactly woke. So in conclusion… And thank you for being here, everybody. This is beautiful. We’ll get you out real fast. We are you going to get you to go watch that game tonight, right? We really do appreciate this kind of crowd, and the love that we’ve had is incredible. But with your vote this November, we are going to fire Kamala Harris. We are going to save America. We’re going to rebuild our nation for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. With your support, we will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We’ll cut your taxes, demolish inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages, and turn the United States into the manufacturing superpower of the world. We will hire American, buy American, build American, and show the whole world that the American dream is back, bigger, better and stronger than ever before. I will end the war in Ukraine, stop the chaos in the Middle East, and prevent World War III. And I’m the one that can do it. I’m the only one that’s going to do it.
(02:06:15)
I will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, and resources. And we have to give them respect again. We’re going to give them respect like they’ve never had. And they’re going to get rid of crime, and they’ll get rid of it quickly and efficiently. We cannot live with the kind of crime that we’re living with in our country today. We will strengthen and modernize our military. I rebuilt our military, and now we’re going to modernize it still further. We will build a missile defense shield all made in the USA, including the Commonwealth is going to build a lot of it. We’re entitled to it. We’re entitled to it. Others have it. We want it too. And we will land an American astronaut on Mars. Get ready, Elon. Get ready. We got to land, and we got to do it quickly. But a lot of that has to do with military, the space.
(02:07:11)
I created Space Force, and it’s going to go down. In my opinion, it’s just about the most important with time of the forces. We were way behind Russia and China, and now we’re leading them by a lot. It’s a great thing, Space Force. First time in 82 years since Air Force that this happened. We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington D.C., making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. We will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools, and we will immediately keep men out of women’s sports.
(02:07:51)
I will defend religious liberty, I will restore free speech, and I will defend the right to keep and bear arms, our second amendment. And we’ll end sanctuary cities and stop illegal immigration once and for all. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. After years of building up foreign countries, defending foreign borders, and protecting foreign lands, we will finally be going to build our country, defend our borders, and protect our American cities, suburbs, and towns. We will protect them like they have never been protected before. We will not be invaded. We will not be occupied. We will not be conquered. They’re doing. This is an invasion into our country of a foreign military. We will be free and proud as a nation again. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive, and every day we’ll be filled with opportunity and hope.
(02:08:58)
But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda once and for all. It will happen, will happen. We want a landslide that’s too big to rig. So early voting is underway. Get everyone and vote. After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of our country. These will be four of the greatest years in the history of our country, and it’s going to happen quickly. With your help, from now until election day, we will redeem America’s promise, and we will take back the nation that we love. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. We will never give in. We will never back down, ever, ever, ever, and we will never, ever surrender. Together, we will fight, fight, fight. We will vote, vote, vote, and we will win, win, win like we have never won before.
(02:10:11)
November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country. And together, we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Thank you. God bless you all. God bless you.","Latrobe, Pennsylvania","2024-10-21",3,3,1,7,3,1,4,2,1,0

Good evening. Hello, everybody. Are you ready for President Donald J. Trump? Yes. We are so excited about tonight. And listen, I’m so excited to be here. I am the Governor of the great State of South Dakota, but I’m going to tell you one thing. Pennsylvania rocks. You all are showing up and showing America how we’re going to make America great again, aren’t you? Listen, I love the fact that in my state we uphold the Constitution. In fact, our state motto is, “Under God, the people rule.” But it’s so fantastic to be here in the city where the Constitution was actually written, right? And I know that you all embrace being the City of Brotherly Love, but I’m going to get real with you right here, Kamala Harris sucks. Right? She sucks.
(01:20)
And listen, if there’s one thing that I’ve learned since being Governor is that leadership has consequences. That it matters who’s in charge, and it impacts every single family, every single business in the state, when you have the right person in the White House and the wrong person in the White House. Listen, I have served as Governor under Joe Biden and under President Donald Trump. Yes. And when President Trump was in the White House, I got to get up every single day and be on offense. I got to go out there and solve problems for my people. I got to be aggressive and help them grow their incomes. In fact, in South Dakota, we have the fastest growing incomes in the entire country. We have the lowest unemployment rate in the country. During COVID, we were the only state in the country that never once shut down a single business. We never mandated anything.
(02:18)
In fact, I didn’t even define what an essential business was because I don’t believe that the government has the ability or the authority to tell you that your business is an essential. We are the only state to never take the elevated unemployment benefits because I said, “Listen, Mr. President, our people want to work.” And they did. They went to work every single day. And listen, we broke the national record for the lowest unemployment rate in the history of the United States of America because people in South Dakota understand we were created to serve each other. In our state, we banned China from owning our land, and we passed the strongest bill in the nation to make sure that only women could play in women’s sports. And when President Trump gets back in the White House, he is going to make sure that we don’t have mediocre men taking away opportunities from our exceptional women.
(03:27)
So listen, I’ve got people in my life that I admire, and tonight you’re going to get the chance to hear from one of them. President Trump is somebody that I appreciate for his fight, his tenacity, his wisdom, and his ability to get things done. He’s a dealmaker and he never loses sight of the American people. I’m going to tell you something. When I first saw him announced for president in 2016, I watched him on TV. I was sitting at home, come down a golden escalator. Do some of you remember that? I remember sitting there and thinking, “Who does that? Who comes down a golden escalator?” Because the politicians that I had known, what they do when they’re going to run for office is they go put on a pair of jeans and they go find themselves a barn and maybe a hay bale. And they say, “Golly, shucks, geez, I’m just like you.” Right? And pretend to be somebody that they’re not, but not President Trump. He was going to be honest with you and genuine with you.
(04:21)
And here is the situation and here is the truth. He doesn’t think he’s any better than you. All those politicians that run and pretend to be something else, they think they’re better than you. They think they’re smarter than you, and that they can sell you a line and a story, and that’s not President Trump. President Trump is himself. He’s fighting for you. He’s fighting to protect you and your family and he loves this country. He loves this country. People ask me-

MUSIC (05:51):

And I’m proud to be an American, where at least I know I’m free. And I won’t forget the men who died, who gave that right to me. And I’d gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today, because there isn’t no doubt, I love this land. God bless the USA.
(05:58)
From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee, across the plains of Texas, from sea to shining sea, from Detroit down to Houston, and New York to LA, where this pride in every American heart and it’s time we stand and say that I’m proud to be an American, where at least I know I’m free. And I won’t forget the men who died, who gave that right to me, and I’d gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today, because there isn’t no doubt I love this land. God bless the USA.

And I’d gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today, because there isn’t no doubt I love this land. God bless the USA.

Kristi Noem (07:42):

Welcome, President Trump.

Donald Trump (07:44):

Hello.

AUDIENCE (07:44):

USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.

Donald Trump (07:55):

Thank you. This is a nice crowd.

Kristi Noem (07:59):

Yes, they love you. You know why? It’s because they recognize, sir, that you’re the one who fights for them. You’re the one who protect them.

Donald Trump (08:10):

And you know what else? They fight for themselves and they’ve been fighting for a long time, and we’re going to make your fight easier. It’s very important, going to make it easier. What’s happened to our country in the last almost four years now, it’s hard to believe, but if you look at the borders, if you look at inflation, you look at the Afghanistan disaster, the most embarrassing time in the history of our country, I think the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan, the way they did… Not getting out. I was getting out with dignity, strength. The way they got out was the most embarrassing thing that ever happened. Probably led to Putin going into Ukraine, probably. He looked at it. He said, “These people aren’t very good, are they?” He would’ve never done that with me. So we’re all in this together. We got to win the election, November 5th.

Kristi Noem (09:00):

Yes. And sir, he has never yet called those Gold Star families to express his grief for the people and the soldiers that we lost that day. And who controls that airstrip now?

Donald Trump (09:15):

China.

Kristi Noem (09:16):

China. Yes.

Donald Trump (09:20):

No, China took over and one of the things, get out. We were there for 20 years. I said, “What are we doing here?” So we get the hell out, but I had a talk with the Taliban and we didn’t lose one soldier in 18 months until this catastrophe happened when they took over. But one of the things, aside from everything else, we left, we spent billions of dollars years ago to build a big air base. And you knew that one from your own time.

Kristi Noem (09:48):

Yes, I did.

Donald Trump (09:49):

A big one. A really good one. Powerful, runways, long runways. And you know what happened? I’ll tell you, they gave it up, and it was one hour away from where China… Forget about Afghanistan. One hour away from where China builds its nuclear weapons, would’ve been very nice to have. And China now occupies that air base. So it’s terrible. It’s terrible.

Kristi Noem (10:11):

It is. Mr. President, as you can see, we’ve got a lot of American patriots here tonight who want to ask you some questions.

Donald Trump (10:17):

Good.

Kristi Noem (10:17):

If you don’t mind, we’ll move into that portion of the town hall tonight. Let’s go to our first question. Our first question is going to be from a man named Reid, and Reid, I’m not certain where you are.

Donald Trump (10:29):

Where’s Reid? There he is. Hi, Reid.

Kristi Noem (10:31):

There he is, over there.

Donald Trump (10:32):

Nice looking guy.

Kristi Noem (10:33):

And Reid, I believe you’re a Navy SEAL, correct?

Reid (10:35):

No.

Kristi Noem (10:35):

No. Okay. I got that wrong. All right, thank you very much.

Reid (10:38):

Good evening, Mr. President. My name is Reid.

Donald Trump (10:41):

Hi, Reid.

Reid (10:42):

I’m a single father and Iraq war veteran. I dream of owning a home for being my son, but mortgage rates under the Biden-Harris administration have made that impossible. What can you do to help make homeownership affordable again?

Donald Trump (10:57):

All right, good. It’s a great question and a lot of people have this question. First of all, it’s too expensive to build the homes and they’re building them and they cost a fortune. And 30% of the cost in some locations is the cost of planning and certificates and all a lot of nonsense they do. They make you go through hell and it takes years to get them. Zoning approvals, all of the approvals you need. We’re going to get rid of a lot of that, but most importantly, we’re going to get interest rates brought way down. We had interest rates at 2%, and now they’re at 10% and you can’t get the money. We had 2% and there was plenty of money for everybody.
(11:34)
And I call the home part of the American dream. We’re going to create the American dream for young people and for older people too, by the way. We’re not going to forget. I happen to be a very young man, but we’re not going to forget the older people. We’re not going to forget the older people. By the way, no tax on Social Security benefits for the older people, for those. I guess somebody said, “Oh, he’s got a conflict of interest because he benefits by that.” I’ll give mine up if you want. I saved tax, but no, we’re going to do that for the older people. That’s a big deal because you’ve been eaten alive with inflation and all I’m doing is getting you back to even. I think when we do that, we’re probably just getting you… You have fixed income and you went up numbers like 30, 40, 50, depending on what they include. They like to say it was a 20% increase. It wasn’t. It was 30%, 40% and 50%, depending on what they want to include.
(12:32)
So we’re going to do that, but Reid, getting back to you. We’re going to drill, baby, drill. We’re going to have so much energy and we’re going to bring prices down because your prices are up. Don’t forget, the damage is done. We have the worst president and the worst vice president in the history of our country by far. And let me tell you, she’s worse than him and he’s actually… I didn’t think I’d ever say this about anybody. She’s more dangerous than him, but he’s actually smarter than her. I never thought I’d say that. I never thought I’d say that, but look, we’re going to get it down. We’re going to drill. We’re going to get the energy down. When the energy comes down, prices are going to come down, all of that, prices. Because when they say, “Oh…” Although they had very bad inflation numbers last month, you saw that-

Kristi Noem (13:26):

Yes.

Donald Trump (13:26):

Very, very bad inflation numbers, despite the big… They did this big drop, probably too big a drop. I’m not going to get into that, but we’re going to get the prices down because the damage has been done. If we had no inflation now, such damage has been done. In my opinion, the biggest inflation in the history of our country. They didn’t include a lot of the bad numbers. I’ll give you an example on housing and on different things like crime statistics are fake. They were fake statistics. They didn’t include some cities that were really bad. So the crime looked like it was just bad as opposed to being horrific. Jobs, 818,000 fake jobs they added, and they padded the job numbers a couple of months ago so that they’d look better on jobs. 818,000, they were fake. They were fraudulent jobs and they thought they’d announced the real numbers after the election, but we had a whistleblower or somebody that let it out.
(14:26)
So they cheated us on, think of that, 818,000 jobs. They cheated. Usually when you have those numbers, it’s 9,000 jobs off it. This is almost 1,000,000 jobs off. It’s not even possible. So we’re going to bring things and Reid, you’re going to buy that house and you’re going to pay 2.5%, 3% interest. And you’re going to say, “I love this guy,” because interest rates, Reid, will follow as the energy goes down. And I made another commitment. I made it over the last month, I’ve been making it. We have more liquid gold under our feet than Saudi Arabia, than Russia, than any other country. I’m going to bring down your energy costs 50% in the first year, 50, 50%. And I better do it because I’m all over the place saying it. I’m going to have problems if I don’t get it done, but we have all the capacity to do it. Nobody else can make that statement. We have so much energy, we don’t even use it.
(15:23)
We get energy from Venezuela. They don’t have good oil. They have tar. They have tar that you have to liquefy. And you know where they do it? In Houston, Texas, because that’s where we have the plant. It’s the only plant in the world that can do it. We do it in Houston. So for the environmentalists out there, this is not a pretty picture, what flows into the air, right? But we’re going to use our beautiful liquid gold and when we get everything else down, houses, everything’s going to come. It’s going to be beautiful. You’re going to have a house. Just wait a little while, give me a little while. Let me get in. One year from January 20th, we will have your energy prices cut in half all over the country.

Kristi Noem (16:03):

Thank you. And Mr. President, in reference to Reid and his family, he’s not in a unique situation. 65% of Americans today cannot buy a home. That has dramatically changed under the Biden-Harris administration and Kamala Harris has embraced the policies that made homeownership disappear and disappear and take away that opportunity from Reid and his family, and 65% of Americans today. Listen, the American dream is still to own your own home, and now that is not possible because of what they’ve embraced. And you talk about liquid gold. If any state understands liquid gold and American energy, it’s Pennsylvania.

Donald Trump (16:42):

Yeah, the Commonwealth. Make sure=

Kristi Noem (16:47):

Yes, the Commonwealth.

Donald Trump (16:47):

Make sure-

Kristi Noem (16:47):

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

Donald Trump (16:48):

By the way, this is a really great Governor, very successful Governor. She read some of the numbers and I thought she would, because why not? Nobody else will do it, but I will-

Kristi Noem (16:57):

I did it fast.

Donald Trump (16:58):

Because I do it for my friend. So you did it beautifully too.

Kristi Noem (17:01):

Yes.

Donald Trump (17:01):

She has done a fantastic job as Governor. And I will say this, I went to school here. I just want to forewarn her because I’ve seen it happen and it’s career-threatening. Don’t ever call it a state. It’s a Commonwealth. And I was saying, “Oh-”

Kristi Noem (17:17):

Lesson learned.

Donald Trump (17:18):

“Has somebody…” Because a lot of innocent lambs have come up and they start talking to the people of Pennsylvania. I love you people. I know you so well. I’m here all the time. I’m here all the time. Yeah, I went to school here. I went to the Wharton School, the great Wharton School of Finance, and they were great. It’s a great place. It’s a great place, but I went to college here. So never ever even think. I watched one man crash and burn. He kept calling it, “This state.” I kept saying, “It’s a Commonwealth.” And by the time the evening… I think his political career ended there.

Kristi Noem (17:55):

Yes.

Donald Trump (17:55):

So go ahead.

Kristi Noem (17:56):

Sir, tonight we have some special guests in the audience.

Donald Trump (17:59):

Good.

Kristi Noem (17:59):

We have a Gold Star family that is with us tonight. Mary and Charles Strange-

Donald Trump (18:05):

Great.

Kristi Noem (18:05):

Are here. Where are they?

Donald Trump (18:09):

Where are they?

Kristi Noem (18:09):

Oh, here they are. Sir, they’re behind us over here to the left.

Donald Trump (18:12):

Oh, come on up here. Come on.

Kristi Noem (18:14):

They lost their son, Michael.

Donald Trump (18:17):

Come on up.

Kristi Noem (18:18):

Come on up here.

Donald Trump (18:25):

It’s a little harder to get up since I got shot. They’ve made it more difficult. Perhaps that’s the way it’s supposed to be.

Kristi Noem (18:33):

Sir, they lost their son, Michael. [inaudible 00:18:41] Did you want to say anything?

Donald Trump (18:51):

Under Obama is right, under Obama. Please, on behalf of your son.

Charles Strange (18:59):

I would ask, Mr. President, my son was killed August 6th, 2011 with 29 other men. It was the biggest loss of life in the Iraq and Afghan war. It was the biggest loss of life in a single day in the history of America. 22 of them men were NAVY Special Warfare. Till to this day, we still haven’t gotten any answers. I was wondering, I’m begging you. We would like a Congressional hearing.

Donald Trump (19:24):

So here’s what we’re going to do. In the first week… Let me have it not the first day because I made a lot of promises in the first day. We’re going to drill, baby, drill. We’re going to close up the border. We’re going to do a lot in the first day. In the first week, we will set up a commission. We’re going to find out because so many people in your same position, they want to know what happened, why did it happen to their son or daughter? And we’re going to do that within the first week. So you get ready to come over to the White House. Okay? All right?

Charles Strange (19:56):

Thank you, Mr. President. Got to say one more thing. I want to let America know. June 2017, President Trump and his wife had me and my wife bring 20 Gold Stars to the White House. Him and his wife stayed the whole time. They had food, drinks. They did a candle ceremony for us. President Trump stood up every time, saluted the Gold Star parents.

Donald Trump (20:26):

That was both a celebration, a remembrance. It had all emotion, right?

Charles Strange (20:32):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (20:33):

They were happy, they were sad, they were devastated, but they remembered their beautiful boy, right?

Charles Strange (20:39):

Yes.

Donald Trump (20:39):

Their beautiful boy, and we’re not going to forget. We’re going to find out what happened. We’re going to do that within the first week, and you have my word. Okay?

Charles Strange (20:47):

Thank you, President Trump.

Donald Trump (20:53):

Good job. Good job. [inaudible 00:20:54] Thank you.

Kristi Noem (21:10):

Thank you. Mr. President-

Donald Trump (21:11):

What a nice couple.

Kristi Noem (21:11):

Mary and Charles’ daughter, Rachel, is also here tonight. She is Michael’s sister. So thank you, Rachel, for coming tonight too. And God bless you and your family.

Donald Trump (21:28):

Thank you.

Kristi Noem (21:29):

Thank you for your service and your sacrifice.

Donald Trump (21:30):

Thank you, darling.

Kristi Noem (21:31):

Yes.

Donald Trump (21:33):

Thank you, honey. That’s tough stuff.

Kristi Noem (21:36):

It is. Thank you for your commitment to-

Donald Trump (21:39):

And like what we were discussing in Afghanistan with the 13 family members, they feel that bad things happened, stupid things happened. And you hate for that to be, and it’s your son or your daughter. There’s no reason.

Kristi Noem (21:53):

They deserve answers.

Donald Trump (21:54):

It should have never happened in Afghanistan. I can tell you that, the 13 that died, and they don’t mention, there were many people wounded too, and I mean seriously wounded with the legs and the arms and the face, and we’re going to give them everything they want. I’ve gotten to know those families. Thanks.

Kristi Noem (22:11):

Thank you, sir. Sir, our next question tonight is from Angelina, who I believe is right here. If you want to come forward, Angelina.

Donald Trump (22:20):

Hi, Angelina.

Angelina (22:22):

Hi. Good evening, Mr. President.

Donald Trump (22:24):

Let me stand up for you. Go ahead.

Angelina (22:26):

My name’s Angelina and I was raised in a Philadelphia Democrat household, a union household. As a mother of a blended family, my top issues are the same issues that face all Americans. Illegal immigration hurts black Americans, inflation hurts black Americans, and dangerous cities hurt black Americans. Like my fellow Americans, my grocery bill has not gone down. Everything is still so very expensive. What steps will your administration take to help American families suffering from this inflation?

Donald Trump (23:07):

So it’s such a great question in the sense that people don’t think of grocery. It sounds like not such an important word when you talk about homes and everything else, but more people tell me about grocery bills where the price of bacon, the price of lettuce, the price of tomatoes, they tell me, and we’re going to do a lot of things. Our farmers aren’t being treated properly, and we had a deal with China and it was a great deal. I never mentioned it because once COVID came in, I said that was a bridge too far because I had a great relationship with President Xi and he’s a fierce man and he’s a man that likes China and I understand that, but we had a deal and he was perfect on that deal. $50 billion he was going to buy. We were doing numbers like you wouldn’t believe for the farmer, but the farmers are very badly hurt. The farmers in this country, we’re going to get them straightened out. We’re going to get your prices down.
(23:58)
But you asked another question about safety and also about black population jobs and Hispanic population, in particular those two. So when millions of people pour into our country, they’re having a devastating effect on black families and Hispanic families more than any others. I think it’s going to spread to a lot of other places. I think it’s going to spread to unions. I think unions are going to have a big problem because employers are just not going to pay the price. And it’s a very bad thing that’s happening. So they’re coming in, many are coming in from jails and prisons and mental institutions and insane asylum. That’s like step above insane asylum.
(24:40)
And whenever I go Hannibal Lecter, you know what I’m talking about. They always go the fake news. That’s a lot of fake news back there too. They always mention, it’s a way of demeaning. They say, “Hannibal Lecter. Why would he mention?” Well, you know why? Because he was a sick puppy and we have sick puppies coming into our country. I figured that’s better than wasting a lot of words. You just say, “Hannibal Lecter. We don’t want him.” But they always say, “Why would you say that?” I do it for a lot of reasons, but I do it because we are allowing some very bad people into our country and they’re coming as terrorists. You saw the other day, last month, they had the record number of terrorists. I had a month and I love Border Patrol. Did you see? They gave me a full endorsement two days ago. Border Patrol. The Border Patrol, and they’re great and they want to do their job. They don’t want to let these people come in.
(25:39)
They look at them, they can tell, they can look at somebody say, “Good, bad.” They say, “What’s coming into our country now, it’s having a huge negative impact on black families and on Hispanic families, and ultimately on everybody.” And we’re going to close that border so tight, it’s going to be closed. And I said the

Donald Trump (26:00):

… Two things I’m going to do. First, we’re going to close that border and people are going to come in. You want people to come in, we need people to come in. People are going to come into our country legally. It’s so unfair. You have people that are waiting on a system in a line, and they’ve been waiting on this line, you know how long? For years, 10 years, 12 years. And they’d study and they take tests and then people come. I actually say, “Why don’t you just go on the … Just come on across.” I tell people that. It’s terrible, right? I said, “Go out. You’re incredible.” They say, “What can I do to speed up the process? I say, you know what? Go to the southern border. I’ll see you on the other side.” It’s so unfair. But we’re going to have them come in legally.
(26:41)
You have to see what they have to do. They take tests on who was the first one here? What date was this? What does 1776 mean? All this stuff. And these other people are coming in and they’re affecting the school systems and they’re affecting the hospital system. If you take a look at what’s going on in Springfield, Ohio, a town of 50,000 people, they’ve just added 32,000 people, illegal immigrants. And we’re not going to put up with it, and we’re going to take care of, your costs are going to come down and you’re not going to have a problem with … Because the biggest problem, and I’m hearing it from Black people, and to a lesser extent right now, but it’ll be the same, Hispanic people. And I’ll tell you what, our poll numbers have gone through the roof with Black and Hispanic, have gone through the roof.
(27:32)
And I like that. I like that. So we’re going to take care of it. I’ll tell you, if everything works out, if everybody gets out and votes on January 5th or before. It used to be, you’d have a date. Today, you can vote two months before, probably three months after. They don’t know what the hell they’re doing. But we’re going to straighten it all out. We’re going to straighten that out too. We’re going to straighten our election process out too. That’s going to be important also. So thank you very much, darling.

Speaker 2 (28:02):

Thank you.

Donald Trump (28:02):

We’re going to get it straight. Thank you.

Speaker 2 (28:03):

Thank you, Angelina.

Kristi Noem (28:05):

Mr. President, we had in the last year, over 800,000 Americans lose their jobs in this country, but 1.2 non-citizens took those jobs. They’re filling the jobs that Americans could have to provide for their families. And Kamala Harris has been in charge of this border. She is the one who has been the border czar who has facilitated this invasion. I’ve always called it an invasion and a war zone down there because we see the criminals and the terrorists coming across.

Donald Trump (28:32):

It is an invasion like we’ve never seen before. And if it was an invasion of people that deserved to come in or that will love the country, will be great. She used to go around saying, “They don’t commit crime.” Have you seen the gang from Venezuela? What they’ve done in Aurora, Colorado?

Kristi Noem (28:52):

But it’s only a few. According to Martha Raddatz.

Donald Trump (28:54):

It’s only a few-

Kristi Noem (28:54):

According to Martha, “Oh, it’s just a few apartments.”

Donald Trump (28:55):

And by the way, it’s hundreds all over the country. And they’re like me, they’re in the real estate business, but they take it over with rifles. They take it over with a level of sophistication, because you know a lot about guns from where you come and you like it. And I’m a big protector of the Second Amendment. We’ve gotten totally endorsed … And if you think that’s easy, it’s not easy. But the NRA gave me total endorsement. I assume you got total endorsement. We have no choice. We have to have it. Especially when you have … It’s amazing, these radical left lunatics, they want everybody to come into our country. Many of those people are criminals. And then they want to also take you guns away simultaneously. They don’t want your guns, but they want them to come in. So you need it for protection. If somebody knows that you have a gun in your house, they say, “Let’s go after somebody else.”
(29:48)
People put signs under, “This gun.” Or some of them actually spell the kind of gun they have. “We have an AK-47 inside.” And people say, “You know what? Let’s just …” And I knew about an AK-47 from a few weeks ago, and the AR-15. I know about that one too. I know a lot. But you know what? You have a lot of bad people out there and you can’t just can’t be a one way street. You know one thing, because she wants to take your guns away. If you take them away, the bad guys are not giving them up. That’s the only thing. I don’t think the good people are giving them up either, if you want to know the truth. But the bad guys are not giving up their guns. That’s the only thing I know for certain, right?

Kristi Noem (30:31):

That’s true. True. JD Vance did a fantastic job on Sunday morning calling out the fake news.

Donald Trump (30:37):

Is he doing a great job?

Kristi Noem (30:38):

Yes. For how they’re trying to diminish the devastation that’s going on in some of these communities. And Kamala Harris has facilitated losing 300,000 children as well since she’s been in charge of the border. I always say that they’re not missing children, that they are trafficked and kidnapped and murdered children, because they’ve come across that border and we have no idea where those children are. And we know how devastating it is, what’s happening to their lives right now with what she’s facilitating.

Donald Trump (31:05):

I think that all bad numbers, we have a lot of bad numbers. There’s so much bad happened in this administration, it’s disgraceful. As an example, there’d be no war with Russia and Ukraine. There’s no way. I get along very well with Putin. I fully understand what’s happening. It was the apple of his eye. He used to talk about it, but I said, “You’re not going in.” And he wasn’t going in. It’s only because of Biden. He looked at this guy, he can’t even believe it. But the same with Ukraine. I got along very well with Zelensky, very well. In fact, he came to New York two weeks ago. He came to see me and I got along very well with him. I’m going to negotiate that thing out. That is now a death trap. You have cities that are all down, those gorgeous golden domes, those magnificent domes are laying on their side, all busted up after … I don’t know, they’re 1000 years old or something, the heritage. What’s happened there.
(31:55)
But many more people are killed than they’re reporting. They knocked down … That was my business. They have apartment houses that are really, they’re like three city blocks long, not that tall, but pretty tall, and they are big. And they knock it down with a missile and they say, “Two people were slightly injured.” No, a lot of people, the number of people dying in the Ukraine-Russia war is a far greater number than anybody knows. And Biden has done nothing about it. He hasn’t even spoken to Putin in over a year. He knows nothing about it. And this is a war that has to end and we’re going to get that war ended. I’m going to try and I think I can get it ended as President-elect, in other words, before I even take over the White House. Got to stop the people from dying.
(32:42)
They said to me, “well, whose side are you on?” I was interviewed by fake news, CNN, you know fake news? Uh-oh, their camera just went off. Their camera just went off. No, no, their camera just went off. Okay. It always happens. Whenever I point to them, immediately they turn it off because they know it. But Kaitlan Collins a nice person, but Kaitlan Collins is interviewing me and she said, “Well, whose side are you on?” I said, “It’s not a question of sides. I want people to stop dying. That’s all. I want people to stop dying.” And it was a very interesting thing because it was a CNN, it was like this, a smaller room, much smaller. This is a big room.

Kristi Noem (33:27):

Big room.

Donald Trump (33:28):

This is a very big room. But it was a much smaller room. But they had all people in there from CNN. Within the first five minutes, they were totally on my side because it’s common sense. And we’re now the party of common sense. I say it, we’re conservative, but we’re the party of common sense. We need walls. We want good education. We want low interest rates. We want to be able to buy a house. We want jobs. And you know what we want? A strong military. I rebuilt our entire military and we want a strong military, and ideally a strong military that we don’t have to use. Isn’t that even better? We’ll have a strong military. If we don’t have to use it, that’s even better.

Kristi Noem (34:08):

I love it. I love it. So Mr. President, let’s get back to our questions. We have Yanni, who’s waiting to ask you a question, has been waiting a long time. Yanni, welcome.

Donald Trump (34:23):

Yanni.

Kristi Noem (34:24):

Just give him one second. Hear they come. Right behind you.

Yanni (34:30):

Thank you. All right. Thank you for being here today, Mr. President.

Donald Trump (34:35):

Thank you.

Yanni (34:35):

To answer questions from all the voters of Pennsylvania and just to work hard and show support. I appreciate that.

Donald Trump (34:43):

Thank you.

Yanni (34:44):

I’m a small business owner in Lansdale. I have a small breakfast, lunch restaurant, Coffee Corner. Thank you. And to be honest, Mr. President, I really am praying for you to get in there and change the policies. Ever since the gas prices started spiking, I noticed literally everything started spiking from deliveries, to services, goods, even overall maintenance. Everything just spiked up and it’s really hurting small businesses, small business owners and those who work within them. So my question is, what’s your plan to help bring common sense back and help small businesses that got destroyed by Democrats after COVID and the Biden administration?

Donald Trump (35:34):

So great. Because small businesses are actually bigger than big businesses. When you add them all up and it’s very important, and it sounds like yours, I would love your food. I can tell by looking at that guy. I think I’d like to go over there. If I’m over there, I’m going to stop by. The fact is that they want to get away from gas. And I have friends, they’re into the cooking world, I’m not. I just like to eat. But they’re into the cooking. And I don’t know how you feel. It sounds like you … They feel that really gas is much better than the electric for cooking. And they have this thing about they want to put gas out of business, right? No gas. You know the amazing thing, we don’t have electric in this country, but we have all the gas you can use. We have oil and gas.
(36:20)
That’s what we have. And even the cars, if you look, they want to go with all electric cars. California’s having blackouts every week, brownouts, blackouts, and then they come up with rules and regulation to go to all electric, but they can’t even supply what they have. It’s so nuts. We’re going to get number one, your utility costs. You heard me say it before. Your costs will be down and we’re getting rid of all the … If you want electric, great, and if you want gas, great. The only thing you can’t have is a hydrogen car. You heard me say that, right? Because you know what happens? They have a new car. They say it’s great, but it’s got one problem. You know what the problem is? Every once in a while, one will blow up and if it does blow up and you happen to be inside of it, you’re in bad luck because you’re not recognizable.
(37:02)
Do you know that? It’s the new thing, hydrogen. I said, “No, thank you. I don’t want it.” I don’t want it. They called the wife, “That’s not my husband.” “Oh, yes it is.” It’s no good. So your energy costs will be down by 50%. Your interest is going to come down and people are going to start to make … Not only you, people will have more money to go to your restaurant. You’re going to have a great business. And during COVID, I was the one that worked out the loans. I don’t know if you got one, but everybody, so many people, millions of small businesses.
(37:33)
And Linda McMahon was the head of Small Business Administration, which was a big business. But she was the head and she was phenomenal. Linda McMahon was phenomenal. So many people tell me about her that she was one of the best secretaries. But Linda McMahon was in charge and they loaned billions of dollars out to people with small businesses. And it was the greatest investment we made. It stopped us from going into a 1929 depression, which is exactly what we would’ve had. And she did a fantastic job.

Kristi Noem (38:04):

She did a fantastic job.

Donald Trump (38:05):

We’re going to get your costs way down. Thank you. Thank you.

Kristi Noem (38:13):

Mr. President, in my state, I always tell people it’s hot in the summer, it’s cold in the winter, and it’s a long ways to drive anywhere, which I think a lot of Americans are experiencing, that no matter what you’re energy dependent. And since Joe Biden has been in the White House and Kamala Harris has supported every single one of his policies. Did you hear her on the view? Did you hear her say she wouldn’t change a thing from what Joe Biden has done? It has cost the average American family $4,500 just in energy costs. Just in energy costs.

Donald Trump (38:50):

Okay, hold it. Can we have a doctor, please? Doctor. Thank you very much. We have incredible people. They come here hours before and it’s a little hot. And so they’re with us all the way. We got to respect them. And you take your time, doctor. Take your time. Thank you very much. We always have great doctors in the audience. We’ve never had too much of a problem. Look at the quality of care we have. It’s incredible when you think, right? These people, first responders. Our first responders are amazing the way they can do things so beautifully and quickly. Thank you. We’ll get it taken care of fast. A lot of it’s pretty easy to take care of. Hardest thing is going to be the border though, in terms of the people that have been let in. The people that have been led into this country, what they’re doing. Where do they come from? What are they doing? What’s their thought process when they allow a thing like that to happen? Let’s wait until they take care of this incredible person who I guarantee you is a great patriot. I guarantee it. Everybody in this room is a patriot.

Crowd (40:32):

Love you Trump.

Donald Trump (40:32):

Thank you. Thank you.

Crowd (40:32):

Trump, Trump, Trump.

Donald Trump (40:32):

Some problems. That looks a little bad.

Crowd (40:32):

Love you, Trump.

Donald Trump (40:32):

Thank you. That looks a little bit bad.

Crowd (40:32):

[inaudible 00:42:18].

Donald Trump (42:24):

Don’t worry. We’ll extend for a little time. Okay? We’re not going to lose anything. We just want to make sure they’re fine. This is a little bit of a tough one, I think. A little tough.
(42:29)
While we’re waiting, so we had a beautiful evening, and I don’t know if they could get this song up quickly, but if they could work really quickly backstage while we’re waiting, Ave Maria. We had Ave Maria the other day in Butler, Pennsylvania. And Butler, we had 101,000 people, it was a celebration. I called Cory, the firefighter, the chief. He was great. And if they could play Ave Maria, if you can get it, Justin, let’s go if you can. It’s a little quick notice. Ave Maria.
(44:18)
Hey. Great. We love that man. We love that man.

Crowd (44:18):

USA, USA, USA.

Donald Trump (45:33):

It’s so beautiful though, right? Listen to that. It’s nice. He’s going to be okay. We have nice music. We’re together. Not bad.

Kristi Noem (45:42):

Yes.

Donald Trump (45:42):

Not bad.

Kristi Noem (45:44):

Right?

Donald Trump (45:46):

So beautiful.

Kristi Noem (45:47):

Thank you, Mr. President.

Donald Trump (45:48):

Thank you everybody very much.

Kristi Noem (45:48):

Thank you everybody for your patience. Yes. We’ll be praying for him. Yep. Thank you, sir. Sir, as we talk about how things have gotten harder under this administration and how Kamala Harris’s policies have been so dangerous for the American people, there’s someone here tonight who wanted an opportunity to ask you a question. Her name is Heather. And Heather, would you please stand? She’s right here, and she is so thrilled to be talking to you tonight, Mr. president.

Angelina (46:21):

Good evening, president Trump.

Donald Trump (46:23):

Hi.

Angelina (46:23):

My name is Heather and I was a registered Democrat for most of my life, but not anymore.

Donald Trump (46:32):

She’s on our side.

Angelina (46:33):

Look at now. Yes, I saw the light. I no longer identify with the Democratic Party. They’ve put criminals and foreign enemies ahead of American citizens. The border is the issue of this election because if we can’t secure the border, we won’t have a country. We know that you’re going to finish the wall, but how are you going to handle the deportation of criminals?

Donald Trump (47:17):

So if you’ve watched any of our last rallies, we have a Criminal Aliens Act of 1798. That’s a long time ago. And it gives the President tremendous power to do what has to be done to secure our country. And you’re right. So if you look at the polls, it says that the number one issue is the economy, number two is inflation. Let’s even put them together. And number three is the border. I disagree. I do agree with you. The number one issue this country has …

Crowd (47:49):

[inaudible 00:48:07].

Donald Trump (47:49):

[inaudible 00:48:26] open the door-

Kristi Noem (47:49):

Do you want me to go tell them to turn off the microphone? The president is wondering-

Donald Trump (47:49):

Thank you very much. Take your time, doctor. It’s going to be good.

Crowd (47:49):

[inaudible 00:50:05].

Donald Trump (50:41):

Open the doors. I wish we could open those doors to outside. Yeah, take your time, doctor.

Speaker 1 (51:11):

[inaudible 00:51:20] goes to the outside.

Donald Trump (51:42):

For security reasons they can’t. But you know what I said, ” Just open them.” Because anybody comes through those doors, you know what’s going to happen to them.

Kristi Noem (51:55):

It looks like, sir, she’s on her feet and walking out. Let’s encourage her.

Donald Trump (00:00):

 

Donald Trump (52:00):

Thank you. Thank you.

Kristi Noem (52:03):

Let her know we’ll be praying for her. And I know it’s really warm in here. Everybody agrees that it’s really warm in here. We’ve got a lot of people who love America. I’m going to ask that if you have a chair, maybe sit so everyone around you can sit and still see the president and ask him questions. Maybe that will help us.

Donald Trump (52:22):

And we can spend a little more time.

Kristi Noem (52:24):

Yes.

Donald Trump (52:24):

And personally, I enjoy this. We lose weight. No, you lose weight. We could do this. Lose four or five pounds. It’s okay with me.

Kristi Noem (52:32):

Kamala Harris is enjoying this.

Donald Trump (52:33):

But some people have been waiting here for two days for this. So it’s a little bit tough. It’s a little bit tough. But they’re going to try and get those doors open.

Kristi Noem (52:40):

Yes.

Donald Trump (52:40):

And I don’t know who’s building this is, but if they had air conditioning, do you see any air conditioning?

Kristi Noem (52:46):

They probably can’t afford it, sir. In this economy.

Donald Trump (52:51):

That’s right. They don’t want to give us air conditioning. It’s too expensive. It costs too much. Anyway, but they’re both okay. They’re both in good shape.

Kristi Noem (53:01):

And that’s wonderful.

Donald Trump (53:02):

Would anybody else like to faint? Please raise your hand.

Kristi Noem (53:05):

Let’s do it now.

Donald Trump (53:06):

Please raise your hand. You know what we could do though, if my guys can do it? How about we’ll do a little music. Let’s make this a musical fest. Oh, lookie, lookie. That’s great. That’s great because it’s nice and cool outside, right?

Kristi Noem (53:27):

Yes.

Donald Trump (53:28):

It’s nice and cool. Why don’t we, and I mean this, if my guys can hear me? Two things. Put up the chart. My favorite chart, my all time favorite chart. And let’s listen to Pavarotti sing Ave Maria. Can you hear that? They gave me the Ave Maria with no voice. There it is. That’s my favorite piece of paper anywhere in the world. I sleep with it every night. I kiss it, I kiss it. And you see those numbers, by the way, for those that we talked about, the border.
(54:03)
When you’re talking about the border, look at the numbers. That was the lowest it ever was right there. That was the last day I was in office. And we’re going to get it lower than that, but we’re going to let people come in. We’re going to let people come in. So very, very important. But there’s one of my most favorite. If I didn’t turn to the right, I wouldn’t be here with you right now. So it’s sort of a cruel world. But I was very proud of that before the fact. Now, even if it had lousy numbers, I would love that piece of paper a lot. So put on Pavarotti singing Ave Maria. Nice and loud. Turn it up louder. We want a little action here. Turn it up louder.

MUSIC (54:41):

Ave Maria, gratia plena.
(54:41)
Maria, gratia plena.
(54:41)
Maria, gratia plena.

Donald Trump (54:41):

Be a boy. That’s for your boy. That’s for your boy. Stand up. That’s for their boy.

MUSIC (54:41):

Ave, ave Dominus tecum.
(54:41)
Benedicta tu in mulieribus.
(54:41)
Et benedictus.
(54:41)
Benedictus fructus ventris tui.
(54:41)
Ventris tui, Jesus.
(54:41)
Ave Maria.
(54:41)
Ave Maria.
(54:41)
Ave Maria.
(54:41)
Ave Maria.
(54:41)
Et in hora mortis nostrae.
(54:41)
Mortis nostrae.
(54:41)
Ave Maria.

Donald Trump (54:41):

Thank you.

Kristi Noem (54:41):

It’s beautiful.

Donald Trump (57:47):

Let’s not do any more questions. Let’s just listen to music. Let’s make it into music. Who the hell wants to hear questions, right? Isn’t that beautiful though? It’s beautiful. And we played that in Butler, Pennsylvania. We had a moment of silence and then we had the bells of Notre Dame go off. And then we had a great opera singer, Christopher, who was so incredible and a great, great opera singer. That’s Pavarotti. I actually asked Christopher. I said, “Your voice is incredible. How does it compare to Pavarotti?” “No, no, no, sir. He was the maestro. He was the greatest of them all.” And this man’s voice, you all probably heard it. He was phenomenal. But he said, “No, no, no. Pavarotti was the greatest.” Maybe we’ll play Time To Say Goodbye when we end.

Kristi Noem (58:37):

Yes.

Donald Trump (58:37):

Okay.

Kristi Noem (58:37):

It sounds fantastic.

Donald Trump (58:38):

All right. Do we want to do that?

Kristi Noem (58:39):

Absolutely.

Donald Trump (58:41):

Instead of your normal rock out of the place.

Kristi Noem (58:42):

Yes.

Donald Trump (58:43):

And then you’re going to say time to go to by then you’re going to go vote and we’re going to win the state. We win Pennsylvania we win the whole thing. We’re going to win. We’re going to win. If we win Pennsylvania, we’re going to win the whole thing. Right? So it’s going to really be something. We just had some numbers coming out of Virginia, which is great. We have numbers coming out. But we win this Commonwealth, we win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, we are in Clover. And then we’re going to fix our country. And we’re going to fix it fast. We’re going to fix it fast. So get that song done, get that song ready when we leave-

Kristi Noem (59:29):

Get that song pulled up.

Donald Trump (59:30):

… you could just sit. By the way when we leave you don’t have to go so fast. You could sit and listen. We’ll play a couple of songs. Some of you’ll be a little warm, but that’s okay. It’s not a bad thing. And if you want, we’re going to do that. But I think it would be beautiful. Don’t you think? A little different?

Kristi Noem (59:46):

I think it’d be amazing, sir.

Donald Trump (59:49):

Isn’t it a nice thing to have imagination? It’s like when Kamala’s teleprompter went out the other day. She was at 32 days. Did you see that?

Kristi Noem (01:00:00):

I did.

Donald Trump (01:00:00):

She loses teleprompters and you wouldn’t know that she lost it. Me, I always lose, if you’re a politician, you can count on 5% of the time. You lose a teleprompter sometimes really badly in the middle of a sentence. And you’re saying, “Ooh, that’s a good…” You got to have a good memory. If you don’t have a good memory, you can’t be much of a politician. But they go out sometimes if you’re outside, the wind blows them down. I had one in Ohio, we had 45 mile an hour winds. And I said, “I’m going to lose these suckers.” And within about the first two sentences they were gone-

Kristi Noem (01:00:31):

I remember that.

Donald Trump (01:00:32):

… they blew off the stage.

Kristi Noem (01:00:32):

I was at that rally.

Donald Trump (01:00:33):

But Bernie Moreno, who’s now doing very well. I understand the senator. So I think he’s doing very well. But we’ll listen to a couple of songs if you want. And that’s okay with me. I like it. So we’ll do that. We’ll do those songs that we had mentioned, Justin. And if Justin doesn’t get it right, he gets fired. Okay.

Kristi Noem (01:00:52):

Sir, I have a quote that I like a lot by John Wayne. It says, “Life is hard, but it’s harder when you’re stupid.”

Donald Trump (01:00:58):

Yeah.

Kristi Noem (01:00:59):

I think that perfectly explains Kamala Harris. Right? Right, sir? Now our life has been hard because of her, but can you imagine what it’s like to wake up as Kamala Harris? How hard life must be? My goodness.

Donald Trump (01:01:13):

Well, we have to beat her. Look, we have to beat her. She’s not for this job. Everybody knows it. Look, we’re running against not her. We’re running against a very powerful and a very corrupt machine. That’s what it is.

Kristi Noem (01:01:25):

That’s right.

Donald Trump (01:01:26):

And the same thing with Joe Biden. Joe doesn’t know where the hell he is. When you talk about Biden he got 14 million votes. He won the primary. And we had a debate. His numbers were very bad and it looked like we were going to win. You don’t know what’s going to happen. But it looked like he was down substantially. They went to see him and they said, “You’re getting out.” He said, “I don’t want to get out. I won.” “You’re getting out.” That was the overthrow of an American president. You could call it a coup, but I don’t even call it that anymore because a lot of people say, “What the hell is a coup?”
(01:01:57)
You can call it that. But it was really basically the overthrow of an American president. And frankly, she’s doing horribly right now. You saw 60 Minutes where they replace her answer with another answer. She’s doing horribly. I have a feeling he might’ve done better than her. Let’s see, well, you have to see what the end is. Maybe they made a good move. But when they talk about a threat to democracy, how about where they take a candidate who won fair and square, they throw him out and they put up a woman who failed was the first one to drop out of a field of 22 and got no votes. And this is the person we’re running against. And she is not a smart woman. That’s true. We’ve had that for four years. We’re not going to have it for another four years. We’re not going to have it.

Kristi Noem (01:02:42):

That’s right. So we’re not going to complain about things. We’re going to fix them. Right. We’re not going to complain. We’re going to fix them. And you are going to fix them right here in Pennsylvania by showing up and voting for President Donald John Trump. We’re going to make America great again. Right?

Donald Trump (01:03:04):

Those doors are open. That feels good.

Kristi Noem (01:03:06):

It does.

Donald Trump (01:03:07):

I feel it right now. I don’t know who’s out there trying to get in. Doesn’t that feel nice?

Kristi Noem (01:03:13):

Yes.

Donald Trump (01:03:15):

There’s nothing like outdoors. You don’t even have the cost of an air conditioner if they have them in this beautiful factory. Anyway, go ahead, please.

Kristi Noem (01:03:24):

Well, sir, do you want to play your song and then greet a few people? Or do you want to…

Speaker 3 (01:03:27):

Which song is that?

Kristi Noem (01:03:29):

Well, you had said you wanted to close with a specific song or we take-

Donald Trump (01:03:32):

Okay, let’s do a couple of-

Kristi Noem (01:03:33):

… two more fast questions.

Donald Trump (01:03:34):

So Justin, how about a couple of really beauties and we’ll sit down, relax. Let me just give you the bottom line though. We win Pennsylvania. We win this great Commonwealth. We are going to win the whole ball game. It’s such an important place. And we relate and we are up in the polls fairly nicely, fairly nicely. But it’s really important. And we’re going to turn this country around. It’s the greatest movement in the history of our country. MAGA, Make America Great Again. When Biden would go on, he used to go on say, “We will stop MAGA, we will stop.” Remember with the purple background, the pink and purple? He looked like the devil, right? But she’s worse than him. Remember it. But they would say, “We’re going to stop MAGA.” MAGA means Make America Great Again.

Kristi Noem (01:04:21):

Great again.

Donald Trump (01:04:22):

I mean, what are you going to stop? And we are indeed going to make America great again. We’re a declining nation right now. We’re a nation in decline. And we’re not going to be in decline for long. Let me tell you, every country respected us four years ago, we were energy independent. We had everything. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We’re going to bring it back bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. Go and vote. Let me hear that music, please.

Kristi Noem (01:04:50):

Everyone. Let’s thank President Trump.

Donald Trump (01:04:50):

Nice and loud.

Kristi Noem (01:04:51):

God bless you. Let’s send President Trump back to the White House.

Donald Trump (01:05:03):

Thank you everyone.

Kristi Noem (01:05:03):

Thank you everyone.

MUSIC (01:10:56):

Quando sono solo.
(01:10:56)
Sogno all’orizzonte.
(01:10:56)
E mancan le parole.
(01:10:56)
Si, lo so che non c’eluce.
(01:10:56)
In una stanza, quando manca il sole.
(01:10:56)
Se non ci sei tu con me, con me.
(01:10:56)
Su le finestre.
(01:10:56)
Mostra a tutti il mio cuore.
(01:10:56)
Che hai acceso.
(01:10:56)
Chuidi dentro me.
(01:10:56)
La luce che.
(01:10:56)
Hai incontrato per strada.
(01:10:56)
Time to say goodbye.
(01:10:56)
Paesi che non ho mai.
(01:10:56)
Veduto vissuto con te.
(01:10:56)
Adesso, si, li vivro.
(01:10:56)
Con te partiro.
(01:10:56)
Su navi per mari.
(01:10:56)
Che io, lo so.
(01:10:56)
No, no, non esistono piu.
(01:10:56)
It’s time to say goodbye.
(01:10:56)
Quando sie lontana.
(01:10:56)
Sogno all’orizzonte.
(01:10:56)
E mancan le parole.
(01:10:56)
E io, si lo so.
(01:10:56)
Che sei con me, con me.
(01:10:56)
Tu, mia luna, tu sei qui con me.
(01:10:56)
Mio sole, tu sei qui con me.
(01:10:56)
Con me, con me, con me.
(01:10:56)
Time to say goodbye.
(01:10:56)
Paesi che non ho mai.
(01:10:56)
Veduto e vissuto, con te.
(01:10:56)
Adesso, si, li vivro.
(01:10:56)
Con te, partiro.
(01:10:56)
Su navi, per mari.
(01:10:56)
Che io, lo so.
(01:10:56)
No, no, non esistono piu.
(01:10:56)
Con te, io li rivivro.
(01:10:56)
Con te, partiro.
(01:10:56)
Su navi, per mari.
(01:10:56)
Che io, lo so.
(01:10:56)
No, no, non esistono piu.
(01:10:56)
Con te, io li rivivro.
(01:10:56)
Con te partiro.
(01:10:56)
This is a man’s world.
(01:10:56)
This is a man’s world.
(01:10:56)
But it wouldn’t be nothing.
(01:10:56)
Nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl.
(01:10:56)
You see, man made the car.
(01:10:56)
To take us over the road.
(01:10:56)
Man made the train.
(01:10:56)
To carry the heavy load.
(01:10:56)
Man made the electric lights.
(01:10:56)
To take us out of the dark.
(01:10:56)
And man made the boat for the water.
(01:10:56)
Like my Bible said, Noah made the ark.
(01:10:56)
This is a man’s world.
(01:10:56)
But it wouldn’t mean nothing.
(01:10:56)
Nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl.
(01:10:56)
L’uomo rincorre il potere ma lui non sa.
(01:10:56)
Che il grande limite ad essere come si parra.
(01:10:56)
Nel palmo stringe un ‘idea.
(01:10:56)
Che non vive.
(01:10:56)
Che nella sua fantasia volle.
(01:10:56)
Se non si accorge che poi.
(01:10:56)
Nulla ha piu senso te.
(01:10:56)
Si vive solo per se.
(01:10:56)
Man thinks about a little bitty baby girls. And a baby boy. Man makes them happy.
(01:11:03)
Because man make them toys.
(01:11:13)
But after man made other things he can.
(01:11:17)
Man makes lira, pesos, dollars, rupees.
(01:11:21)
To buy for every good woman and every man.
(01:11:22)
This is a man’s world.

Donald Trump (01:11:30):

So this has been an honor tonight. We could do another question or two if you’d like, but probably… do you want to do one? Do you want it? Let’s go. Let’s go. But it ends so beautifully. How about this? We’ll play YMCA and we’ll go home. But listen, whatever you can do, get out there. We have to win. This is important. This is the most important election in the history of our country. And you know what? I never thought I’d say it again. I said it with ’16. We then fixed the border. We did everything. We had a great economy. It was good. For ’20 we didn’t have to say it, by the way we got millions and more votes in ’20 that we did ’16. But there’s never been spirit that we’ve seen like this. And that’s because we saw how bad they are.
(01:12:21)
They are so bad. And frankly, they’re evil. They’re evil. What they’ve done, they’ve weaponized our elections. They’ve done things that nobody thought was even possible. So we’re going to go, we’re going to vote. We’re going to have a good time. We’re going to make our country great, I want this to be a really important evening. And those two people that went down our patriots and we love them. And because of them we ended up with some good music. Right? Right.

Kristi Noem (01:12:47):

Yes.

Donald Trump (01:12:48):

So play YMCA. Go ahead. Let’s go nice and loud.

Kristi Noem (01:12:51):

Here we go, everybody.

(01:13:39)
I said, I was down and out with the blues.
(01:13:39)
I felt, no man cared if I were alive.
(01:13:39)
I felt the whole world was so jive.
(01:13:39)
That’s when someone came up to me.
(01:13:39)
And said, young man, take a walk up the street.
(01:13:39)
There’s a place there called the Y.M.C.A.
(01:13:39)
They can’t stop you back on your way.

Donald Trump (01:17:52):

Nobody’s leaving. What’s going on? There’s nobody leaving. Keep going. Keep going. Should we keep going? All right, turn that music up. Turn it up. Great song.

MUSIC (01:17:54):

It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth.
(01:17:57)
The minor falls, the

MUSIC (01:18:00):

The major lift.
(01:18:01)
The baffled king composing Hallelujah.
(01:18:04)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
(01:18:04)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
(01:18:24)
Your faith was strong, but you needed proof.
(01:18:28)
You saw her bathing on the roof.
(01:18:31)
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you.
(01:18:38)
She tied you to a kitchen chair.
(01:18:41)
She broke your throne and she cut your hair.
(01:18:43)
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah.
(01:18:43)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
(01:18:43)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
(01:18:43)
Baby, I’ve been here before.
(01:18:43)
I know this room, I’ve walked this floor.
(01:19:14)
I used to live alone before I knew you.
(01:19:18)
I’ve seen your flag on the marble arch.
(01:19:25)
Love is not a victory march.
(01:19:28)
It’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah.
(01:19:29)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
(01:19:29)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
(01:19:51)
There was a time you let me know.
(01:19:54)
What’s really going on below.
(01:19:58)
But now you never show it to me, do you?
(01:20:02)
And remember when I moved in you.
(01:20:08)
The holy dove was moving too.
(01:20:08)
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah.
(01:20:08)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
(01:20:08)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
(01:20:08)
Maybe there’s a God above.
(01:20:08)
And all I’ve ever learned from love was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you.
(01:20:43)
And it’s not a cry you hear at night.
(01:20:51)
It’s not somebody who’s seen the light.
(01:20:52)
It’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah.
(01:20:52)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
(01:20:52)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
(01:20:52)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
(01:20:52)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
(01:20:52)
It’s been seven hours and fifteen days. Since you took your love away.
(01:22:28)
I go out every night and sleep all day.
(01:22:28)
Since you took your love away.
(01:22:28)
Since you been gone I can do whatever I want.
(01:22:28)
I can see whomever I choose.
(01:22:28)
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant.
(01:22:28)
But nothing.
(01:22:28)
I said nothing can take away these blues.
(01:22:28)
‘Cause nothing compares.
(01:22:28)
Nothing compares to you.
(01:22:28)
It’s been so lonely without you here.
(01:22:28)
Like a bird without a song.
(01:22:28)
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling.
(01:22:28)
Tell me baby where did I go wrong.
(01:22:28)
I could put my arms around every boy I see.
(01:22:28)
But they’d only remind me of you.
(01:22:28)
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me?
(01:22:28)
Guess what he told me?
(01:22:28)
He said, “Girl you better try to have fun no matter what you do.”
(01:22:28)
But he’s a fool.
(01:22:28)
‘Cause nothing compares.
(01:22:28)
Nothing compares to you.
(01:22:28)
All the flowers that you planted, mama.
(01:22:28)
In the backyard.
(01:22:28)
All died when you went away.
(01:22:28)
I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard.
(01:22:28)
But I’m willing to give it another try.
(01:22:28)
Nothing compares.
(01:22:28)
Nothing compares to you.
(01:22:28)
Nothing compares.
(01:22:28)
Nothing compares to you.
(01:22:28)
Nothing compares.
(01:22:28)
Nothing compares to you.
(01:22:28)
I mean there’s nothing
(01:22:28)
I will never, I could never.
(01:22:28)
I think there’s nothing.
(01:22:28)
I will never, I could never.
(01:22:28)
[inaudible 01:26:38].
(01:22:28)
I will never, I could never.
(01:22:28)
[inaudible 01:26:54].
(01:22:28)
I will never…
(01:24:03)
Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton.
(01:24:04)
Old things they are not forgotten.
(01:24:05)
Look away, look away, look away Dixieland.
(01:24:05)
Sing it fellas.
(01:24:06)
Oh, I wish I was in Dixie, away, away.
(01:24:06)
In Dixieland I take my stand to live and die in Dixie.
(01:24:06)
For Dixieland, I was born.
(01:24:06)
Early Lord one frosty morning.
(01:24:06)
Look away, look away, look away Dixieland.
(01:24:06)
Glory, glory hallelujah.
(01:24:06)
Glory, glory hallelujah.
(01:24:06)
Glory, glory hallelujah.
(01:24:06)
His truth is marching on.
(01:24:06)
So hush little baby.
(01:24:06)
Don’t you cry.
(01:24:06)
You know your daddy’s bound to die.
(01:24:06)
But all my trials, Lord will soon be over.
(01:24:06)
Glory, glory hallelujah.
(01:24:06)
His truth is marching on.
(01:24:06)
His truth is marching on.
(01:24:06)
I’ve been sellin’ my soul, workin’ all day Overtime hours for bullshit pay.
(01:31:34)
So I can sit out here and waste my life away.
(01:31:38)
Drag back home and drown my troubles away.
(01:31:42)
It’s a damn shame what the world’s gotten to.
(01:31:45)
For people like me and people like you.
(01:31:49)
Wish I could just wake up and it not be true.
(01:31:53)
But it is, oh, it is.
(01:31:57)
Livin’ in the new world. With an old soul.
(01:32:01)
These rich men north of Richmond.
(01:32:07)
Lord knows they all just wanna have total control.
(01:32:12)
Wanna know what you think, wanna know what you do.
(01:32:18)
And they don’t think you know, but I know that you do.
(01:32:20)
‘Cause your dollar ain’t shit and it’s taxed to no end.
(01:32:23)
‘Cause of rich men north of Richmond.
(01:32:23)
I wish politicians would look out for miners.
(01:32:40)
And not just minors on an island somewhere.
(01:32:44)
Lord, we got folks in the street, ain’t got nothin’ to eat.
(01:32:48)
And the obese milkin’ welfare.
(01:32:51)
Well, God, if you’re 5-foot-3 and you’re 300 pounds.
(01:32:56)
Taxes ought not to pay for your bags of fudge rounds. Young men are puttin’ themselves six feet in the ground.
(01:33:04)
‘Cause all this damn country does is keep on kickin’ them down.
(01:33:09)
Lord, it’s a damn shame what the world’s gotten to.
(01:33:14)
For people like me and people like you.
(01:33:18)
Wish I could just wake up and it not be true.
(01:33:22)
But it is, oh, it is.
(01:33:24)
Livin’ in the new world.
(01:33:29)
With an old soul. These rich men north of Richmond.
(01:33:35)
Lord knows they all just wanna have total control.
(01:33:40)
Wanna know what you think, wanna know what you do.
(01:33:43)
And they don’t think you know, but I know that you do.
(01:33:48)
‘Cause your dollar ain’t shit and it’s taxed to no end.
(01:33:52)
‘Cause of rich men north of Richmond. I’ve been sellin’ my soul, workin’ all day.
(01:34:19)
Overtime hours for bullshit pay.
(01:34:22)
When I look into your eyes.
(01:34:22)
I can see a love restrained.
(01:34:22)
But, darlin’, when I hold you.
(01:34:22)
Don’t you know I feel the same?
(01:34:23)
Yeah.
(01:34:23)
‘Cause nothing lasts forever.
(01:34:23)
And we both know hearts can change.
(01:34:35)
And it’s hard to hold a candle.
(01:34:35)
In the cold November rain.
(01:34:35)
We’ve been through this such a long, long time, just tryna kill the pain.
(01:34:35)
Ooh yeah.
(01:34:35)
But lovers always come and lovers always go and no one’s really sure who’s lettin’ go.
(01:34:35)
Today, walkin’ away.
(01:34:35)
If we could take the time to lay it on the line.
(01:34:35)
I could rest my head, just knowin’ that you were mine, all mine.
(01:34:35)
So, if you want to love me.
(01:34:35)
Then, darlin’, don’t refrain.
(01:34:35)
Or I’ll just end up walkin’ in the cold November rain.
(01:34:35)
Do you need some time on your own?
(01:34:35)
Do you need some time all alone?
(01:34:35)
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own.
(01:34:35)
Ooh, don’t you know you need some time all alone?
(01:34:35)
I know it’s hard to keep an open heart.
(01:34:35)
When even friends seem out to harm you.
(01:34:35)
But if you could heal a broken heart.
(01:34:35)
Wouldn’t time be out to charm you?
(01:34:48)
whoa- whoa.
(01:35:42)
Sometimes, I need some time on my own.
(01:35:42)
Sometimes, I need some time all alone.
(01:35:42)
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own.
(01:35:42)
Ooh, don’t you know you need some time all alone?
(01:35:42)
And when your fears subside.
(01:36:15)
And shadows still remain, ooh yeah.
(01:42:51)
I know that you can love me when there’s no one left to blame.
(01:42:51)

Donald Trump (02:48):

This is some crowd. What a group. I know so many of the people, all these people. They’re tough as hell. They’re from Georgia, they should be tough. I want to just say a special hello to Georgie. You have a lot of excitement going on outside. You know that, right? Right, Kelly? We have a lot of excitement going on outside. We’re doing very well, they tell me, but one day is not too much, but looks like we’re doing pretty well. What do you think? Congressman Barry, huh? I hear we’re doing well. I’m thrilled to be back in the incredible state with thousands of proud hardworking American patriots, which is what you are. You are hard workers and it’s going to pay off.
(03:27)
We’re going to take back our country. We’re going to turn it around so fast. Before we begin, I want to send our love and prayers to everyone here in Georgia hit by the hurricanes. You got hit hard. As well as Florida, North Carolina, they really got hit hard. South Carolina got hit pretty hard. Virginia, Alabama, and Tennessee. That’s a lot of hurricane. That was a big hurricane. I thought we were over. Yeah, that’s Trump country, you’re right. It’s Trump country. It is indeed. We love it. We love the people. We wish they took better care of Trump country, right? Our hearts are with the families of every citizen who is tragically lost and all of the people who lost their home.
(04:17)
A lot of homes were lost too. A lot of people were lost. The citizens of Georgia are tough and resilient, and this state is going to come back stronger than ever. We’re going to make sure it comes back stronger than ever. And I want to thank you, Governor Brian Kemp, he’s done a really good job, and his staff for the work he’s done and they’ve done. And God bless you all. Despite the storm, early mail-in voting in your state is now underway and early in-person is underway. But I’ll tell you what, I’m hearing very good things now. It hasn’t been going on too long, but we’re seeing numbers. They’re saying, “Wow, those are big numbers.”
(04:57)
In fact, they set a record for the number of ballots today, right? A number, right? So if you have a ballot, return it immediately. If not, go tomorrow. As soon as you can, go to the polls and vote. Then for the next 21 days, get everyone you know to get out and vote. We don’t want to take a chance. We can’t lose this country. If we’re not successful, we’re going to lose our country. From the very beginning of this journey, I’ve been on a mission to rescue our nation from a failed and corrupt political establishment. And are they corrupt? $500,000 for a painting. That’s not good, is it, huh? I said, “Well, that one, they’ll never get away with, Byron.” I said, “No way.” How did Byron do? Did he do a good job of it?
(05:54)
Great. Great guy. Stand up, Byron. Big star. Barry, he’s going to be a big star, this guy. Do I have him right? He’s going to be a big, big… He already is a big star, if you get right down to it. Thank you very much. Good job. I heard every word. I was taking pictures. I said, “Well, that guy’s doing a good job.” And to give you back the country that you believe in, the country you were born in, and the country that you deserve, that’s what you want. Everywhere you look, under Kamala Harris, the American standard of living is in a free fall. Nothing works. Have you ever noticed nothing works? It’s like everything they touch turns to… I won’t say it.
(06:38)
No, everything they touch, including their rescue plan, which they didn’t even have a plan. You’re working more hours for less money to afford smaller houses, worse cars, fewer groceries with absolutely nothing left to save. Our schools don’t teach. Our cities aren’t safe. Illegal aliens are pouring in by the millions and millions and millions, and we’re teetering on the brink of World War III. Other than that, I think we’re doing quite well. Kelly’s saying, “Man, this is really depressing.” And look, we’re down to the wire now, wouldn’t you think, huh? Three weeks from tonight, the people of Georgia are going to end Kamala Harris’s reign of failure.
(07:27)
And we are going to launch a new golden age of American success for the citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. It’s going to be a golden time. And I want to thank a man named Elon Musk because he did a big favor. He did. When I was down here, early on, I was down and we were with the folks and they were going, “Sir, we need Starlink.” I said, “What the hell is Starlink?” He said, “Do you know Elon Musk is the most incredible thing.” Because, specially in North Carolina, they had no communication whatsoever. Right, Barry? They were just wiped out and they had no communication and it’s hard to get. It’s hard to get, so I called up Elon and he endorsed me.
(08:24)
He gave me the greatest endorsement. And how about that rocket, the way it came in yesterday? Was that crazy? I was on the phone with somebody and I have the television on, no sound or anything, and I’m looking at the screen, but I’m talking to somebody, I guess couldn’t have been that interesting a person. And I’m watching the screen and this big monster, the thing’s like 20 stories tall, and it’s coming down, the fires pouring out of it from all angles. And I say, “I don’t know. Could you hold on a minute? There’s something happening on… I’ve never seen anything like this.” Brandon. The great Brandon Beach. Does everybody know Brandon? Great. Thank you, Brandon. What a good patriot he is. But I said, “I’ve never seen anything like this.”
(09:12)
So it’s coming down, down, down. And I said, “Oh, man, it’s going to be terrible. It’s going to hit the gantry,” or whatever they call it, “It’s going to hit. It’s going to knock it over.” Marjorie Taylor Greene, it’s going to knock it over. It’s going to knock it on its ass like you knock your competitors on their ass, Marjorie. Right? And she is highly respected, let me tell you. Smart. So, it’s coming down and I didn’t like the angle. I said, “Come on, baby.” And then all of a sudden you see the fire pouring from the right side. It’s strange. Boom. And I said, “That was amazing.” And I forgot the guy that was on the phone. They have a certain respect where we’re leading everybody, so they hold on forever. Doug, they would’ve held on for an hour, but I just totally forgot because I’ve never seen anything…
(10:05)
I said, “Elon, could you do me a favor? Starlink.” “Yes. What would you like about it?” I said, “They need hundreds of them in North Carolina and also in Georgia. They really want them in Georgia too because they lost their wires. They’re down.” And I’m talking to him. And as I’m talking, I get a call from somebody in North Carolina, “Thank you for the Starlink.” And I said, “How the hell did you do that?” No, it’s true. Elon, he’s different. No, he’s different. I said, “Elon, I don’t know what Starlink is, but they like it.” But no, it was funny because I’m on the phone and it’s all done. And I’ll tell you what, it got here and it was delayed once it got here.
(10:51)
Bad things happened. It’s happened with a lot of people, but ultimately, they got it. And I said, “How does it compare to the lines?” They said, “It’s better.” And the guy just is a fantastic guy. So we want to thank him for his big endorsement. You know where he is right now? He’s in Pennsylvania campaigning for me. Is that great? He’s in Pennsylvania campaigning. And we were in Butler, Pennsylvania honoring Corey, the firefighter who lost his life. Two other good guys, by the way. Two other very good guys, but he lost his life. And Elon was there and he wore the black hat. I did not know we had a black hat. It’s black with black letters, okay?
(11:37)
And he called it dark MAGA. And he hasn’t taken it off. He loves that hat. No, but we want to thank him. He’s been really great. He’s a great patriot. He’s a brilliant guy too. I said, “Does anybody else do that with the rockets because I’ve been watching this stuff for a long time?” Byron, have you ever seen that before? I said, “Can the Russians do it?” “No.” “Can NASA do it?” “No.” “Can anybody do it?” “No, only me.” I said, “Keep it going, man. That’s pretty cool.” It’s the coolest thing I’ve seen in a long time. Pretty cool. We got to protect our brilliant people. We got to remember that. There aren’t too many brilliant people around. Not too many, right, Marjorie?
(12:23)
Marjorie knows better than anybody. There aren’t too many. Oh, you’re Lieutenant Governor is right there. Look at this. We have big power, huh? Thank you, [inaudible 00:12:33]. With your vote, we will create millions of new great-paying jobs, wages will soar, your taxes are going to fall. And America has lost its confidence. It’s a terrible thing to say. I said it one time and I said, “You know it’s actually true.” But it’s going to come back very quickly. America will be respected again. The American people will be optimistic again and you will be proud of the life and the future you are going to give and giving to your children. Our legacy will be nothing less than the rebirth of the American dream.
(13:03)
You don’t hear about the American dream anymore. We used to hear about the American dream. My father used to say, “You want to live the American Dream, son.” And I said, “What’s the American dream, Dad?” And I didn’t quite make it. I wanted to make it. Now, I could have the American dream. You know what? I had the American dream. Did I need this? But I wouldn’t swap it. I wouldn’t swap it, Byron. I was saying yesterday, “I could be on the waters of Monte Carlo. I could be all over the world enjoying myself, but I’d much rather be right here with you.” It’s true because we have a mission. We have a mission. And we don’t have a choice. We really don’t have a choice.
(13:55)
Somebody said, “Why are you doing this?” I said, “Because we don’t have a choice. We’re going to make America great again. What’s better than that?” I have a lot of rich friends. They go here, they go there. They’re boring as hell. Nobody cares. They put on their bathing suit. They don’t look a lot better than Biden, except they have fancier beaches, right? And look what we’re doing. We’re doing something. If we win this election, it will be the greatest event, political event or otherwise, in the history of our country. And we’re going to turn it around fast. It’s going to go very quickly. We’re going to turn it around fast. Kamala is turning us into a third-world nation, which is true. I didn’t know she didn’t pass her bar exam. Did you know that?
(14:47)
I’m hearing this. I don’t want to tell you about it. Please, I don’t want to. I will not mention the fact that she didn’t pass her bar exam, so I’m not going to mention that. But with our victory, we’ll become the greatest, strongest, freest, safest, and the most powerful nation the world has ever seen. We’re going to put it back together fast. Four years ago we were respected, now they laugh at us. Other countries laugh at us. I had a good interview today with Bloomberg. Did anybody see that? That was a great interview. He was a Trump hater and brilliantly, my staff didn’t tell me that. I said, “Who is this guy?” “Sir, he hates you very much. He’s been after you.” So they got me all started before I went up, but it was a great interview. And I think it really showed the plan that we have because he was unable to dispute it. We’re going to bring so many companies back into our country, and a lot of them are going to be based right here, right in the great state of Georgia. There’s going to be a lot of things happening. It’s going to happen very fast. Remember, I used to say, “We’re winning too much”? You’re going to say to me, Marjorie is going to come with the Lieutenant Governor and Doug and Kelly’s going to be there. Got a lot of cash, I’ll tell you. And Loudermilk, he’s coming in with this beautiful family.
(16:11)
And you’re going to be begging me. You’re going to be saying, “Please, sir, there are too many companies coming into Georgia. Please, we can’t take it anymore. We don’t have enough people for the jobs. Please, we don’t want any more companies. We don’t want any companies.” That was the takeoff on the winning. We’re going to win so much. You’re going to come, “Please, sir, we can’t win anymore. We’re winning too much.” We had a lot of fun. We have a new one now. All those companies are going to be pouring in. But starting on day one, I will quickly defeat inflation and we’re going to bring down the energy prices fast. Liquid gold. And we will make America affordable again.
(16:52)
Prices are still going up. They’re going up again, and they surged again very viciously last month. And here we go again. And Kamala Harris has no idea what’s happening. They say, “What do you think of inflation?” “What?” “What do you think of inflation?” She didn’t know what the hell they were talking about. Other than that, she just got it right under toe, right? She didn’t really know what they were talking about when they said inflation. What is it? Kamala Harris has developed a policy. You know what her plan is called? I have no plan to fix it. She says, “I have no plan to fix it.” She’s changed 15 policies. On occasion, somebody will run and change one, like they’ll be for the death penalty or not for the…
(17:38)
She’s changed 15 policies. No fracking, no this. Every single thing she’s changed. Go back a year and a half and take a look, 15 policies. I’ve never seen anyone get away with one major change. The whole thing is different. She loves walls now. She loves walls. She loves our police, but she was in charge of defund the police. Do you go from a defunder of the police? I don’t think so. Lieutenant Governor, do you go from a defunder? She was a leader of defund the police. And now she says, “I love the police.” In the meantime, every police group in the nation is supporting me. And the Border Patrol came out. Did you see that? The Border Patrol came out.
(18:37)
Thousands and thousands of them came out. Two nights ago when they endorsed Trump, they said, “We endorse…” Paul gave a beautiful speech. Incredible people. I know them all very well. They never met her. They never spoke to her. They were asked, “Did you ever get a call from anybody in Border Patrol?” “Yes.” “Did you ever call them back?” “No.” They never once

Donald Trump (19:00):

… once spoke to anybody even in authority or not authority, nobody, they never spoke. And here we have the biggest travesty. I believe it’s a bigger problem because of the murderers and everything else coming into it. I believe, look, inflation and the economy are always big. And they’re big, what they’ve done to our economy. But I really believe that the border and the illegal immigration and 21 million people, many of them criminals, is a bigger thing than inflation.
(19:27)
I may be wrong. I may be wrong, but I think so. It’s rated number three after the economy and inflation. I put them sort of together, economy, inflation. I think they sort of belong together. What do you think? I think so. But I think the biggest thing is when you have 13099 murderers, people that are … four people that were ready for to be executed, they said rather than executing them we’ll let them come into America. 13099, many of them killed more than one person. And they’re happily ensconced in Georgia. They’re all over the country. And these are killers. These are people that will kill you quickly. They don’t need too much of an excuse. They have, as they say, a short fuse. You don’t want to get into a little tiny argument that for somebody else would be an argument for them, it’s not good, right? It’s not a good situation for you.
(20:32)
We don’t want them in this country. We’re getting them out of this country fast. Fast. And I think it’s a bigger I think it’s bigger than the economy. I think it’s bigger, it’s horrible. Inflation is a country buster. It’s busted many countries, but I think it’s bigger than inflation, even. Over the past four years, her inflation nightmares cost the typical family $29000.
(20:56)
Think of that, $29000 in inflation. The reason you feel poorer is thanks to Kamala. And that’s the fact is you are. And she was the one, they called her the taxing queen in San, she destroyed San Francisco. San Francisco, if you go back 18, 19 years ago, it was the number-one city. It was the best city in the country. Now it’s not even livable. And I speak against myself.
(21:21)
I own property in San Francisco. I own a lot of property. I own property in California. And every time I say this, I say, I’m saying, please don’t say it in my … please because every time I say it, I depreciate the value of my property. Guys that would’ve said, I love that place you have and I own on the water the most gorgeous things right on the ocean. I always say I have the ocean.
(21:48)
Pebble Beach only has the bay. That’s in my head. And I never even need it because it’s always full. But I have the ocean. Pebble Beach has the bay. The truth is, every time I speak this way, I hurt the value of my properties. But ultimately I don’t give a because this is much more important.
(22:05)
She destroyed along with Gavin Newsom, the governor, Gavin Newsom, they destroyed, the two of them, what she did to San Francisco. And then she became Attorney General. What she did to California is a disgrace. And now she wants to do that to the United States of America. We’re not going to let that happen, Marjorie, her plan will raise taxes for the typical American family by an estimated $3000. Take a look at this.

Speaker 3 (22:35):

Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax bill

Speaker 4 (22:39):

Calling for a bold repeal of President Trump’s tax cuts. If Kamala Harris was elected president, there are many different tax policies which could cripple the economy. But the first thing she wants to do is allow these Trump tax cuts to expire. Even the New York Times admits that 85% of the middle class got a tax cut.

Speaker 5 (22:56):

Americans will face a hike. The tax foundation, finding that a couple with two kids making $165000 a year would have to pay over $2400 more in taxes.

Speaker 3 (23:08):

And on day one, I will repeal that tax bill. Joe Biden and I are about to work to get rid of that tax cut. Joe and I are about to get rid of that tax bill. Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax cut. Everything from a 70 to 80% tax rate. I think that’s fantastic.
(23:23)
We’ve got to increase the corporate tax rate. Part of that is going to be about repealing that tax bill they just passed. And also looking at estate taxes are going to have to go up. We will tax capital gains. But we’re going to have to raise corporate taxes.

Speaker 4 (23:36):

Taxing unrealized games just doesn’t seem fair in any sense of the word.

Speaker 5 (23:44):

But the value of your home goes up. You pay higher taxes, even if you don’t sell your home.

Speaker 4 (23:45):

The value of your home never moves stocks moves to say, we’re going to tax what you don’t have. That’s a sore point and it’s a big deal. Is that something you think she firmly believes in?

Speaker 6 (23:55):

I think it’s part of the proposals of the campaign.

Speaker 3 (23:57):

Under my plan, there will also be a carbon fee. There has to be some connection between the fee and bad behaviors. And there has to be in that. We have to monitor whether it’s going to be passed on to consumers. But I’m going to tell you that should never be the reason not to actually put a fee and particular a carbon fee.

Speaker 4 (24:18):

Don’t let Kamala Harris fool you. Harris not only supports taxing service workers’, tips, news reports confirm Biden and Harris have weaponized the IRS to confiscate your tip money. Harris and Biden have literally unleashed the IRS to harass workers who receive tips and they just may be coming to your house next. Only President Trump has a plan that ends all taxes on service workers’ tips. President Trump, he’s on your side.

Donald Trump (24:45):

I’m Donald J. Trump and I approve this message. The only problem with putting it up, the fake news and there’s a lot of them back there, so I have a lot of friends, no, I have a lot of friends, they watch the rallies on television. This isn’t a rally, this is just a get-together. Look at it all the way up to the bleachers.
(25:12)
But they watch. Hello up there. It’s a nice place. But they watch, a friend of mine goes, he says the only problem is when you put up the videos, they don’t show it on television. You know why? Because they don’t want to move the camera a little bit up? They don’t want to because they don’t want do anything that’s good for us. They don’t want to do anything that’s good for us.
(25:35)
And you know what? They ought to be ashamed of themselves. I’m going to ask them to put on woke … Do you know what this is all about? We don’t have a woke military, but some people think there are some people in the top. Can you put that woke military, put it up, the master sergeant.

Speaker 7 (25:56):

You little scumbag. I’ve got your name, I’ve got your ass. You will not let, you’ll not cry. You will learn by the number.

Speaker 8 (26:03):

Happy pride. Happy Pride Month. And actually let’s declare it a summer of pride.

Speaker 7 (26:09):

So you’re a killer?

Speaker 9 (26:14):

Sir. Yes sir.

Speaker 7 (26:14):

Let me see your war face.

Speaker 9 (26:22):

Sir.

Speaker 7 (26:23):

You’ve got a war face? Ah! That’s a war face. Now let me see your war face.

Speaker 9 (26:23):

Ah!

Speaker 7 (26:23):

Bullshit. You didn’t convince me. Let me see your real war face.

Speaker 9 (26:23):

Ah!

Speaker 7 (26:32):

You’ll be a weapon, you’ll be a minister of death praying for war. But until that day you are pukes. You are the lowest form of life on earth. You are not even human fucking beings. You are nothing but unorganized, bombastic, pieces of amphibian shits. You look to me like the best part you run down the crack mama’s ass and ended up as a brown stain on the mattress. I love working for Uncle Sam.

Speaker 10 (26:58):

I love working for Uncle Sam.

Speaker 7 (26:58):

Let’s me know just who I am.

Speaker 10 (27:19):

Let’s me know just who I am.

Speaker 7 (27:19):

One, two, three, four United States Marine Corps.

Speaker 10 (27:19):

One, two, three, four United States Marine Corps.

Donald Trump (27:29):

So we won two beautiful, big, horrible in many ways, but we won two world wars with that attitude. And we didn’t win with the woke stuff. But our military is not woke. We have some people on the top that are woke. They’ll be gone so fast your head will spin. Okay?
(27:53)
Under the Trump administration, we will put more money in your pocket. We will let you keep more money than you ever thought possible. We’re bringing it down. We’re bringing the costs down. We will have large tax cuts for workers and we are going to have something very special. No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on social security benefits for our seniors.
(28:25)
That’s a big one. And you deserve it. You know what, you put up with inflation for the last two and a half years, that shouldn’t have ever been here, would’ve never been here. Think of it. We wouldn’t have had the war with Russia and Ukraine. No way Russia would’ve done it. You wouldn’t have had October 7th with Israel. You wouldn’t have had inflation.
(28:48)
You wouldn’t have had that horrible, most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan, the way they withdrew. We were going to withdraw. But we’re also going to keep Bagram, the biggest military base in the world. We gave it to China. You know who has it now? China has it one hour away from where they make their nuclear weapons.
(29:07)
And on that day we lost 13 great soldiers and many were obliterated. No arms, no legs. The face was just disastrous. Nobody ever mentions them, but we had a lot of people badly, badly hurt. And what a shame. What a shame to see what’s happened to our country, the border, all of the things that we’ve suffered in the last almost four years. We’re going to get it back so fast. We’re going to be proud again. We’re going to be very proud of our country.
(29:50)
Isn’t it nice to have a president that doesn’t need a teleprompter? What do you think, Byron? It’s better, right? Huh? Did you see when her teleprompter crashed last? She was talking about 32 days, Mr. Congressman 32. She goes, and the election will be in 32 days. 32 days. The teleprompter crashed. 32 days. She kept going. I would’ve loved to. It kicked back in.
(30:24)
It’s called a kickback. Like some people know a lot about a kickback. It’s called a kickback. They know in this administration. But no, it’s a kickback. It kicks back in and it did kick back in just in time because she was about ready to eat the … Byron goes, yeah, this was … When you do this, you have to have one ability. If the teleprompter goes, because it goes, I figured 5% of the time it goes, it’s gone.
(30:51)
And you’re standing up in front all of the fake news, which is actually a much bigger audience than this because you’ve got millions of people watching. So you’re standing in front of the fake news with fake reporters and some very bad, and some good ones and some good ones. I’d say 5%, right? What do you think, Byron? 5%? I think so. 5%, maybe less.
(31:14)
And if that happens, and if you don’t do this well, you are ridiculed the following day, right? And I’ve had to go off with Bernie Marino in Ohio, I was doing very well, but I had 57000 people out there, television blazing. And he’s going for the nomination and it wasn’t looking good. The wind was blowing at 49 miles an hour.
(31:37)
And I got onto the stage and I’m looking at these two things and they were like … so you can’t read them. But I said, “Don’t worry about that. They’re going to blow off.” And within the first minute they blew off the stage. They were like 30 yards down the road. And I’m standing there. And that’s when you find out whether or not you have what it takes, right? You’re up there all by yourself. You’re up there all by yourself, Mr. lieutenant governor, and you better get going.
(32:06)
And you can’t do that 32 stuff that she was doing. Why? Why did he have to fix that damn teleprompter? But it is true. I have a friend, he just wants to go into politics, but he’s petrified of, he said, “I have one phobia.” He’s a very smart guy, very rich guy. He wants so much to be in politics. I said, “Do you have any problems?” Well, I have a problem with … I have a phobia against public speaking. I said, “Don’t go into politics. If you have that phobia, I would not bother.”
(32:38)
Right? What do you think Byron? No good, right? He wouldn’t come up and warm up the crowd like you did. He’d stand there, get me off. To crush inflation we will quickly become energy independent and we will frack, frack, frack and drill baby, drill. She won’t frack. She’s not going to frack.
(32:57)
She’s not going to frack. Pennsylvania, please. Pennsylvania. Remember, she’s not fracking. Her whole life is, we will not frack. We will not frack. She’s gone through a whole life like this. All of a sudden, oh, I look forward to fracking. No it doesn’t. I will cut your energy prices in half within 12 months.
(33:17)
You’re going to get them in half, 50% in 12 months because we have liquid gold. Nobody else has it. We became number one with me. Number one in the world in oil, we have oil and gas. Number one. Russia was number two. Saudi Arabia was number one. We were number three or number four. When I left, we were so far above them and we were going to be not only, we were energy independent, we were going to be energy dominant. We were going to sell to Asia, we were going to sell. We were going to pay off a lot of debt. We were all set to go.
(33:51)
And then we had a great election because we got millions more votes. But there’s something happened a little bit. We can’t let that happen again. We’re not going to let that happen. Look what happens when bad things like that happen. I will cancel Kamala’s insane electric vehicle mandate immediately. Everybody will drive an electric car, they say. And soon the problem is they don’t go far.
(34:19)
They’re very expensive. They’re made in China and they have some other things. Now, with that being said, I think they’re phenomenal. They really are. I say that because of Elon. Elon, they are phenomenal by the way. But for certain, whatever, and we’re going to have hybrids, we’re going to have gasoline-propelled cars. We’re not going to have hydrogen cars. Hydrogen cars is the new thing, right? Do you know about that? Hydrogen is the new car. They say it’s great. Has one problem.
(34:48)
If it explodes, you’re dead. If it explodes. They actually say if it explodes, you’re unrecognizable. You call your wife over, they call up the wife, would you please come here and take a look and see whether or not this is your husband because we cannot see. And she goes to the nearest tree, which is about 100 yards away, and she says, no, it’s only blood.
(35:10)
There’s nothing there. She says, “I can’t tell.” So hydrogen has one problem. It’s extraordinarily dangerous. Other than that, the car works quite well, actually. I won’t get near. I will never get, I don’t care how good it becomes. And they’ll probably say they’re making it safe, but it’ll never be safe enough for us, congressmen. I also announced last week that we will make interest on car loans fully tax-deductible because affording a car is essential to restoring the American dream.
(35:46)
I got a call from a big guy on Wall Street, says, “Where the hell did you come up with that idea?” Think of how simple that is. How great is that? Because now we’re going to make more cars because of it, right? They said, “Where did you come up?” When you think it’s so simple? It was mentioned to me by somebody a week ago.
(36:02)
I said, has nobody, I think … a car loan deductible. Wouldn’t that be nice? It’s going to spur the industry, but what’s really going to spur the industry is what we’re doing with taxes and tariffs. Every company’s going to come pouring back. But the interest deduction is so great. And I say it’s like the paperclip. 125 years ago, a guy took a piece of metal and he started playing games with it, and he had the paperclip. And now since then, everybody that’s seen the paperclip says, shit, why didn’t I think of that?
(36:34)
It’s so simple. That’s like that for the car loans, right? It was so simple. Nobody thought. The biggest guy in Wall Street called me the smartest guy. He’s got like 183 IQ. He said, “Where the hell did you come up with that idea? That’s pretty good.” As we rebuild our economy, we will also restore our borders, if you don’t mind.
(36:54)
For four straight years, Kamala has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from prisons and jails and insane asylums and the worst mental institutions anywhere in the world, not South America, all over the world. They come from Venezuela. They come from the Congo in Africa, and she has resettled them very nicely into our communities, to prey upon our innocent American citizens, right?
(37:23)
When I went on November 5th, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins. It’s going to be a restoration. One of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gangs, they’re nice people, the only thing nice about them, they make our criminals look like nice people. Because now we say, I thought those guys were tough.
(37:47)
They were really not tough. Not compared to these guys. Remember when she said, migrants coming in do not cause crime? Really? Check out the front page of the New York Post today. They’ve taken over Midtown Manhattan,

Donald Trump (38:00):

But one of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gangs that Kamala has imported into our country is the savage Venezuelan prison gang known as Tren de Aragua. Have you heard of them? Tren de Aragua. In Aurora, Colorado, and communities in all 50 states, this gang is terrorizing law-abiding citizens, including taking over multiple apartment complexes. And they are really going and they are vicious as hell. Take a look at it.

VIDEO (38:33):

Open borders, deadly consequences.
(38:35)
Border Crisis. Record high crossings are putting a strain on cities across America.
(38:40)
It is a full-blown invasion.
(38:42)
Armed Venezuelan gang members storming an apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado.
(38:47)
When people talk about migrant crime, this is what they’re talking about. Biden and Harris had created a program to bring them in under humanitarian parole.
(38:54)
I am in favor of saying that we’re not going to treat people who are undocumented across the border as criminals.
(38:59)
More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder have been released into the United States.
(39:06)
My 20-old daughter, Kayla Hamilton, was murdered in her own room. Kayla’s murderer was apprehended by border patrol crossing illegally into the US.
(39:14)
Kayla’s murderer had been improperly released into the United States.
(39:18)
Abolish ICE.
(39:19)
Yeah, we need to probably think about starting from scratch.
(39:22)
An Afghan national is in custody today after being accused of plotting an election-Day terrorist attack. The suspect entered the US on a special immigrant visa. More than a dozen people suspected of being Tren de Aragua gang members, right here in San Antonio.
(39:34)
The gang members had been terrorizing the apartment complex.
(39:38)
New details in the murder of Laken Riley. The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuelan national.
(39:45)
And was paroled and released into the country by the Biden administration.
(39:49)
Two men, investigators say are in the country illegally from Venezuela, are charged with capital murder and the death of Jocelyn Nungaray.
(39:55)
Court documents suggest a group of men arrested for beating and robbing. A Dallas woman last month are members of a Venezuelan Street gang.
(40:03)
Manuel Hernandez Hernandez was booked by Colleyville Police just two days earlier and released the day before the robbery.

Donald Trump (40:21):

And that’s number one. That’s number one. I will tell you right now. That beats out the economy. That beats it all out. To me, it’s not even close. The United States is now an occupied country, but on November 5th 2024, that will be Liberation Day in America. Liberation Day.
(40:56)
Thank you. So sad. This is what you call an unforced error. What they’ve done to this country, and to think that she’s running for the President of the United States is a disgrace, and she’s allowed millions of these people into our country, destroying our country. And it’s not easy to fix either. We’ll get some and we’ll get them out. Then they’ll get somebody else who has a nice look and a child, and it’ll be the poster. It’ll be, “Oh, how horrible are we?” It’s a very tough thing to fix, but we’re going to fix it because we have no choice. But we’re going to start with these horrible criminals, and there are lots of them. 425,000 illegal aliens, convicted of crimes, are now free to roam in our country, including all of those murderers and all of those drug dealers and all of the human traffickers in women.
(41:51)
They traffic in women. You hear children, you hear men. No, they traffic, really, in women. Right here, in Georgia, our nation was robbed of a brilliant 22-year-old nursing student, Laken Riley, you know Laken very well now. And after months of prodding him, Biden couldn’t pronounce her name, he said Lincoln Riley, and Lincoln Riley’s the football coach. And this was in Congress. Couldn’t even get the name right. Laken was a brilliant young student, top in her class, going to be a great nursing student. Everybody admired her. She was killed viciously. While out on a jog, she was assaulted, beaten, and horrifically murdered by an illegal alien. You saw the picture from Venezuela. The savage monster who murdered Laken was let in and released into our country by Kamala Harris. She came in through open borders. Nobody even checked him. Come right in. Come right in.
(43:05)
His brother was also in Georgia illegally. He suspected of viciously murdering someone also in the Venezuelan gang. He’s in that gang. In September, an illegal alien who Kamala imported through her open border process was arrested in Tennessee for strangling a 25-year-old girl to death and leaving her body covered in blankets for days. Her parents, oh, her parents. All of these parents. They’ll never be the same. He had a prior arrest record in the United States, was shielded for deportation by the horrible, horrible laws, rules, and regulations of Kamala. I can’t believe how they allowed this country to become like this. This country is not… It can’t go on like this. And they’re getting worse. You look at little towns, villages, cities, and even the big cities, they’re petrified that this is going to happen to them.
(44:08)
The Governor of Colorado is a radical-left Democrat, but he just doesn’t know what to do. He doesn’t know what to do. Springfield, Ohio. We love Ohio. We won Ohio every time, by a lot. We’re leading now by a lot. And I know Springfield, beautiful little place. 50,000 people. They’ve just deposited 32,000 illegal migrants into the town. They don’t speak English, but they’ve taken up the schools. They don’t speak English. What they’re looking for is interpreters because they have no idea what they’re going to do. Very few of them speak English, so they’re looking all over for interpreters. That’s what they want to find.
(44:54)
When you go to the hospital, you can’t get into the hospital because the hospital’s all occupied. And they want to be so nice and they want to be politically correct. And the mayor seems like a nice person. He’s saying, “We’ll figure out how to make it work.” But you can never figure it out. It can never work. Think of it, 50,000 people, all of a sudden they have 32,000. They’ve almost doubled the size with people that came from a rough country, really a rough country. Immediately upon taking the oath of office, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. Have to. Have to do it.
(45:48)
I will rescue every town across America that has been invaded and conquered. They’ve conquered our country. This is an invasion of a military force. They have weapons that are on par with our US military, but we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals to jail or kick them the hell out of our country, ideally the second. Because we don’t want to have to pay for the costs, so we’ll ideally bring them back to their country. When I first came into the White House, a General came up, I said, “General, I want to get MS-13 gangs. They’re the worst in the world.” MS-13 is very similar, but probably even nastier. And we had thousands of them in our country because Barack Hussein Obama could not get them out, because the countries from where they came would put airplanes, big ones, on the runway, so you couldn’t land. They wouldn’t let the buses through. And they gave up. Years ago, they gave up.
(46:45)
And I said to the General, “I want them out.” He said, “Sir, they won’t take them back.” I said, “Who?” And they said the countries. I won’t embarrass them because I know the presidents very well. And they’re very streetwise, very smart people. And I said, “How much aid do we give those three countries?” “Sir, we give them $750 million a year.” And I said, “Inform them that they’re delinquent, that they aren’t allowing us to bring back people that belong there and they’re getting no further aid at all from the United States.”
(47:19)
And the following day, early in the morning, I got calls from all three separately. All three, ” Sir, there seems to be a misunderstanding.” And I said, “No, there isn’t. You sent them over in a caravan.” The caravan. I made up that name too. I’m good at names. You know the names. I can’t use those names too much because many of them were for Republicans. We had some beauties, but we can use Pocahontas and other people. But I said, “Listen,” I said, “You wouldn’t take them back.” “Sir, there seems to be a misunderstanding. We would love to take them back. We love MS-13 so much. Sir, please, please let us take them back. Sir, please.” And we sent them back and they took them like nothing. Like nothing.
(48:22)
We send them out of our country, and if they come back into our country, it’s an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole. That way, they’re not coming back. That way, they’re not coming back. And you don’t hear these ideas from anyone else. I can tell you, and I’m not proud of them. But you also have to wage a little bit of common sense, don’t you? Because we’re the party of common sense. And I’m hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer.
(48:52)
Kamala’s migrant invasion, and that’s what it is, is also devastating our great African-American community, stealing American jobs, crushing wages, undercutting the voting power of our own citizens and bringing drugs, crime and death to our country. And the African-American community and the Hispanic community is being devastated with the jobs. The numbers are down six, seven, eight, 9%. They’re going to work and they’re saying, “I’m sorry, we’re not going to take you anymore.” People that have worked there, and worked there well for years, are now being told they no longer have a job because they have illegal immigrants coming in and taking their job. And I’ll tell you what, any African American or Hispanic, and you know how well I’m doing there, that votes for Kamala, you got to have your head examined because they are really screwing you. They are really screwing you. Right? It’s happening in numbers.
(50:10)
You’re going to hear about it. It’s a big story. It’s a big story. You’re going to start hearing about it in a little while. It’s a big story. It’s terrible, it’s terrible. People that have been here for years, years, they’ve done a good job, they’ve got their family, and now all of a sudden, one day, they don’t have a job anymore. Kamala’s open border policy is a complete and total betrayal of African-American communities and Hispanic-American communities.
(50:36)
And unions are next. Oh, they’re going to take on the unions. You watch. Virtually 100% of all of the jobs created in the last year have gone to migrants. I don’t know if anybody knows that. First of all, the jobs that they got, which made their numbers look better, but they don’t count really, they’re bounce-back jobs. Those are jobs that we had. We had the greatest economy in history. We had to take a pause for the pandemic. We did a good job on that. And then the people, they call it bounce-back. It’s standard, a very standard phrase, but they call it bounce-back. They bounce back. But think of it, of the jobs created, almost every one of those jobs was taken by a migrant. Under Trump, Americans will always come first. Take a look.

Were you the last person in the room?
(52:51)
Yes.

Donald Trump (52:55):

She would do nothing different. Think of it. You have the worst administration in the history of our country. The happiest person, you’ve heard me say this, Jimmy Carter, because he looks brilliant by comparison. His administration, by comparison, is brilliant. So he’s happy. He’s an old guy now, but he’s a happy man. Just this week, I was proud to receive the official and unanimous endorsement of America’s Border Patrol agents. All 100%. All of them.
(53:24)
And I was also honored to receive the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police. Something they don’t do easily. But they said, “We have no choice. We have no choice.” 400,000 law enforcement officers nationwide. They did something to Biden that was amazing. They stole the election from him. I’m not a fan of Biden, who could be, but they stole the election. They took it away like candy from a baby. And he’s angry. And they were all angry. They’re angry as hell. I think he likes me more than he likes her. Can you believe it? I believe that. I believe that, Steve. He likes me more than her. Can you believe it?
(54:21)
But we will restore law and order in America. But here’s what, to do it, you have to do one thing. I don’t want your money. I don’t want anything. I just want you to get out and vote and get your friends to vote. That’s it. I don’t want money. Just go and vote. We’re pleased to be joined with some incredible people, friends of mine, talented people. You have a lot of great people in this state. Lieutenant Governor, Bert Jones. Please, Bert, stand up. Members of Congress, Mike Collins. Mike, great guy, tough guy. You don’t play games. He said, “Oh, put me in that committee. I want to be in that committee to cut costs.” He’ll do a better job. Nobody could do like that. Thanks, Mike.
(55:14)
Somebody that’s been unbelievable at searching out really bad, sick politicians on the other side. He was accused of… He walked in with a couple of young constituents to show them the Capitol, as I remember it, and they accused him of showing in Russians. What? Instead of most people, they say, “Oh, please,” He became the opposite. Indignant and wild. And he has done some job on the committee. Barry Loudermilk. We love you, Barry. Courage. I remember that. You’re supposed to have pictures of him walking around with two kids from the area and the parents. They were Russian. These people are sick. And all it did is made him angry. And you have done some jobs, so we appreciate it.
(56:11)
A man that we’ve said hello to, that you’ve experienced. He’s got a big future. He is a fantastic guy and a friend of mine, Byron Donalds. Byron, thank you.

A very strong, smart person. A woman who is amazing, actually, to me. She’s really amazing. Marjorie Taylor Green, thank you. And another warrior who’s always been with us, Rich McCormick. Where is Rich? Thank you. Thank you, Rich. And a really good guy, a former congressman, so respected by everybody. Doug Collins. Thank you, Doug. And you-

Donald Trump (57:03):

And your former senator who was really a terrific person and respected so much in Washington and still is even I think even more respected now, Kelly Loeffler. Thank you, Kelly. Good job. The next congressman from Georgia’s third congressional district. He’s worked with me since like 2015, before ’16. And everybody, after they got to know him, they said, “Could we use him too?” There was nobody like him. He’s going to be a congressman. I think he always wanted to be a congressman. And when the seat came up in his district where he grew up, I said, go ahead. And did he win? Man, did he win, Bert? What’s going on with him? He’s making us all look bad. He got so many votes. Brian Jack. Where’s Brian Jack? Thank you. There he is.
(57:57)
There he is. Is he a natural or what? Everybody loves this guy. I love this guy. It’s not my thing either, but I love him. He is a special character, that one. Are you enjoying it, Brian?

Speaker 11 (58:12):

Very much so.

Donald Trump (58:14):

Good. He’s got the word. He got the whole deal. He’s good. He’s going to be good for a long time. Your Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner John King. Thank you, John, very much. Thank you, John. Thank you, John. Public Service Commissioner, Bubba McDonald. Bubba. What a man. A very special state senator. I just met his daughter, you not believe it or not, I was at another place two hours ago. I’ve been doing this for 42 days straight without a rest. You believe it? 42.
(58:56)
But two and a half hours ago I was in another little different part of your state and this beautiful young woman said, “My father is Brandon Beach,” and I’m much more impressed with him now than it was two and a half… This guy is such a great patriot, State Senator, Brandon Beach. Thank you. And your daughter is fantastic. She was so proud of you. I said, “He’s that good, isn’t he, right?” She said, “He’s even better than that.” You got a good daughter. So it was great to meet her.
(59:26)
Georgia GOP chairman, Josh McKoon. And he is good. He is good. So Josh, stand up for… how the hell… Are we doing well?

Speaker 12 (59:38):

Yes, sir.

Donald Trump (59:39):

Are we doing as well as I’m hearing?

Speaker 12 (59:41):

Yes, sir.

Donald Trump (59:42):

All right. That’s what I’m hearing. I’m hearing… And we’re no longer in poll territory, right? We’re in territory of votes coming in. We’re not really looking so much at polls anymore. The votes are coming in, and they’re coming in at a nice level for us, right? He’s done a fantastic job. Thank you, Josh. I appreciate it.
(01:00:07)
A woman who I’ve known for a long time, and she’s always been there for us. She’s a special woman, very religious person. Every time she sees me, she prays. And I say from you, I accept that, and I will always accept it. Alveda King. Thank you, Alveda. Thank you. Good genes. She’s got very good genes, beautiful genes. And a friend of mine, one of the most successful business people in the country, a great great developer from Florida, New York, and a lot of other places, but just a terrific person. And he’s become… I think he loves politics, but he wants to just make sure we all do well. That’s all he wants. Mr. Steve Witkoff. Steve. Thank you, Steve. Great. Thanks, Steve.
(01:00:55)
So here are the facts. Kamala Harris is a radical-left Marxist, rated even worse than Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, that’s Pocahontas. Remember? Her mother said she’s Indian. Why? Because she’s got high cheekbones. That was the reason. So I immediately called her Pocahontas, and that was the end of her. She was leading in the presidential race. And I don’t think she likes me too much, but the mother said she had high cheekbones and I said, Pocahontas. And then all the hell… the world went crazy. And she actually went out and got a test, remember? And she was so happy. 1000th 24. In other words, maybe a million years ago there was a possibility, but she was happy. She said, this proves I’m an Indian. And I said, no, no, I have more Indian blood in me, and I don’t have any. I’d love to, but I don’t have any. And that was the end of her presidential run. That was the end. I did the world a favor. Of course, look what we got. Look what we got.
(01:02:10)
Kamala destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of Defund the Police movement, and anybody who wants to defund the police for even one week or one day is not worthy of being president of the United States. It’s a radical left person. Kamala vowed to abolish ICE. She wants to let her millions of illegal… Medicare. Oh, she wants to raid Medicare. That’s what they’re going to do. Raid Medicare, Social Security. She wants to ban fracking. As California Attorney General, that’s what she did. And she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon and rape of an unconscious person as totally nonviolent crimes. She said they’re nonviolent crimes. She pledged to confiscate your guns and endorse the total ban on handgun ownership. She even called for free sex changes for prisoners and illegal aliens in detention at taxpayer expense. And here’s something she did that was terrible. On her resume, she said she worked at McDonald’s. She never worked at McDonald’s.
(01:03:24)
So in conclusion, with your vote this November, we are going to fire Kamala and save America. Right? We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always cherish our great American flag. We will cut your taxes, crush inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages, and create the greatest job boom the world has ever seen. We’re going to do that. It’s not going to even be hard. We are going to do it through low taxes and high tariffs, actually.
(01:04:04)
We won’t have any inflation, and we’re going to do it. We’re going to have a boom, and the auto industry is going to boom like it’s never boomed before. We will hire American, buy American, build American, grow American, and show the whole world that the American dream is back bigger, better and stronger than ever before. I will stop the global theft of American jobs and turn the U.S. into the manufacturing superpower of the world. I will end the war in Ukraine, stop the chaos in the Middle East, and prevent World War III. I can do that.
(01:04:40)
I will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources and respect they so dearly… I’ll tell you what, we have to give our police… We have to take care of our police and it’s turning out to be more dangerous than ever. And once we give them that power back, it will be much less dangerous than ever. But right now, being a policeman or a policewoman is very dangerous. We have to give them back their honor, and we have to shield them, and we’re going to indemnify them against being hurt because they do something that’s good, and they lose their family, they lose their pension, they lose their house, they lose everything. Now we’re going to indemnify them. If they’re right, and we’re going to find that most of them… they’re going to right… And you always have bad apples. It’s a shame. It’s a horrible thing. But sometimes, you have to just say, but we always have bad apples and we’ll do everything we can to get those bad apples the hell out.
(01:05:40)
But we have to take care of our police and our law enforcement. That’s why our country is going to hell with crime. We will strengthen and modernize our military. We will build a missile defense shield all around our country, and it’ll be made right here. A lot of it’s going to be made, as you know, you do a lot of it, it’s going to be made in the USA, but it’s going to be made a lot of it right here. And we will put the stars and stripes on the surface of Mars very soon. Very soon. We will get Elon to get those rockets going, Elon, get them going, get them going.
(01:06:19)
He is going to send a rocket up very soon to pick up the two guys. How would you like to be stuck in space? I said, when are you sending that? Very soon. I’m just about ready to send it. It’s like sending a bus for him. We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington, D.C., making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. They will get critical… Oh, and we will do this. Critical race theory and transgender insanity will be out of our schools immediately. Immediately. And we will keep men out of women’s sports. I will defend religious liberty, your right to free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. And the Second Amendment is under siege. You know that the Second Amendment is under siege. It will not be… Four years it was under siege, I will tell you. But we’re going to protect our Second Amendment a hundred percent.
(01:07:24)
After years of built… Thank you. After years of building up other countries, we will protect our borders, defend our families, and protect our American suburbs, cities, and towns. We’re going to protect our country. We will end the sanctuary cities immediately and stop illegal immigration once and for all. No more sanctuary cities. We will put American citizens first, American children first, American patients first, American taxpayers first, American workers first, and American communities first, we will put our country first. We will put communists, Marxists, and fascists last and they will always stay last. From Savannah to Columbus, from Marietta to Macon, and from Augusta to Atlanta, we inherit the legacy of red-blooded American patriots who poured out their blood, sweat, and tears to defend this country they love.
(01:08:26)
We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up those big beautiful skyscrapers. You’re welcome. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom. And we are not going to lose the nation that they worked for and fought for and died for. We are not going to lose it. We will not be invaded. We will not be occupied. We will not be conquered. We will defeat the enemy at all levels of combat. We will defend our civilization, reclaim our sovereignty, and we will be a strong, proud, and free nation once again.
(01:09:24)

Donald Trump (01:09:41):

Thank you. Thank you very much. Everyone will prosper. Every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with the opportunity and hope of a lifetime. But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda once and for all. We want a landslide that’s too big, too big. We can’t let anything happen. Early voting is underway. Get everyone out. Get everyone you know, just get them all out to vote. Go tomorrow. After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of our country. These will be despite the fact that we’ve been set back so far by incompetent, vicious, foolish leadership, we will have the four greatest years in the history of our country. And with your help from now until election day, we will redeem America’s promise and we will take back the nation that we love. Nothing will sway us, nothing will slow us, and no one will stop us. We will press forward to our magnificent American destiny and together we will fight, fight, fight.

Donald Trump (01:11:24):

We have to get out and vote. We have to win, win, win. We got to win, win, win. If you don’t win, win, win, we’ve all had a good time, but it’s not going to matter, right? Sadly. Because what we’ve done is amazing. Three nominations in a row, what we’ve done, we got to win. If we don’t win, it’s like it was all for not very much. We can’t let that happen.
(01:11:50)
November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country and together we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Georgia. God bless you. God bless you, Georgia.
(01:12:44)
Thank you. God bless you all.

Donald Trump (02:49):

Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. It’s a great honor to be here and thank you, John. It’s really wonderful to be back in Detroit and it’s a true honor to be back at the Detroit Economic Club. Really terrific people. I was here in 2016, so maybe you brought a little luck. We’re going to do it again. We’re going to do it again. Before we begin, I want to send our love to everyone affected by the hurricane. As you know, it was a rough night and who would’ve thought a lot of things happening at one time, but that’s just ripped through Florida and also the people of North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Florida again and Tennessee for what they went through with Hurricane Helene. We had quite a combination.
(03:48)
I’d like to congratulate Governors of Florida, Ron DeSantis, Governor Brian Kemp of Georgia and South Carolina, Henry McMaster. They were really hit hard and they’ve done really a fantastic job. The federal government, on the other hand, has not done what you’re supposed to be doing, in particular with respect to North Carolina. They’ve let those people suffer unjustly, unjustly and we’re praying for all of those who lost a house or much more importantly, a precious loved one. There were many, actually many, many in Georgia and North Carolina. Florida will rebuild and come back strong. It always does. I look forward to returning very soon. We’ll be there very soon and okay, now let’s get to the reason that I’m here today.
(04:39)
I think you’re going to find some interesting things, both good and bad, but we make the bad into good. That’s what we like to do. It was just announced that inflation came in substantially hotter than expected last month, double what was predicted, with much of the gain coming from food prices going up, rent and housing costs going up and car prices going up. Interest rates, as you know, are also a big factor. They’re very high. They’ve gone from 2% when I was in office to 10% now and you can’t get the money. That means it’s much higher than 10%, which really kills the American dream for young people. We have a lot of young people here, a lot of college people here. The fact is that the Federal Reserve brought the interest rates down a little too quickly. It was too big a cut and everyone knows that was a political maneuver that they tried to do before the election, but they did the wrong thing. It was totally a political decision and inflation has started to rise.
(05:45)
Four years ago when I left office, we had no inflation. We had virtually, just think of it, we had virtually no inflation for the entire four years. When people made money, that was really their money. It wasn’t money that they have to give back to a source that they know nothing about, including government. Under Biden and Harris because of inflation, the economy has been a total disaster, but Kamala says that she can’t think of one thing that she would do differently. She said that two days ago in a very unfortunate interview for her and there are many people saying, in particular, highly respected analysts like Scott Besant, one of the top analysts on Wall Street, that the only reason that the stock market has gone up is because Donald Trump is doing very well in the polls and it looks like he’s going to win. A lot of people are saying that, who knows, but a lot of people are saying that. The only way to end this suffering is to vote for change this November because what we’re doing is our country is very bad. We’re being scoffed at and laughed at all over the world.
(06:58)
The other big news is the fraud committed by 60 Minutes and CBS together with the Democrat party, working together with them, which will go down as the single biggest scandal in broadcast history, I predict. It’s a big story. I don’t know if you’ve seen it yet. They learned about it yesterday evening. The real answer of Kamala was very crazy or dumb. Nobody knows what, but it was bad, so they actually replaced it. Think of this. They’ve never done that for me. They actually replaced it with another answer, having nothing to do with what she said before. They took another thing that she said and they just lopped it in there. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it, 60 Minutes. Nobody’s ever seen and they wanted to make her look as good as possible, make her look better.
(07:54)
A big problem in our country is the fake news. We have such fake news. I mean, I’ve had a recent thing where, as an example, an Obama disciple named Peter Baker, he writes for the failing New York Times, he wrote a piece about me and just one of the many things he said that was wrong, but he said that I would go around saying that I was honored here years ago as the man of the year or whatever and I talked about how your car industry. This was long before, many years before I ran for president, maybe 18, 20 years ago and he made the statement that never took place. That honor never took place. I was never honored here, which was quite insulting actually. I didn’t remember the specifics of it, it was 18 or 20 years ago, but he said it never took place. Very much like Kamala, she said she worked at McDonald’s and she didn’t and I didn’t want to get into that, so what I did is, I asked my people, you got to find it.
(09:03)
When, it was like 19 years, 17, it was a long time, but I was honored and guess what? They found it. I was. Right here. Nice looking young guy. That was a long time ago. Let’s see, this was an update of the article that they originally printed. It says Oakland County GOP to honor Donald Trump, former president to speak at upcoming Lincoln Day fundraising dinner. It says down here, the county party gave Trump the Man of the Year award at the dinner too and he was honored as Man of the Year. Here’s your article right here. Oakland Press, Oakland County GOP to honor Trump. I have a man in the failing fake New York Times, disgraceful paper, they ought to be ashamed. Whatever they say, believe the opposite. Who knows how long they’re going to be around. It’s killing our country, this kind of stuff. It’s killing our country. It’s really terrible.
(10:17)
I want to thank the president of the Detroit Economic Club, Steve Gregorian, who’s a very wonderful guy, as well as Congressman John James, Ambassador David Fisher, Michigan Senate Republican leader Eric Nesbitt. Thank you Eric. It’s great. Thank you very much. How are we doing? I hear we’re four points up. How are we doing? Yeah, she says at least it. Thank you. Michigan House Republican leader, Matt Hall. A very good guy. Thank you, Matt. Thank you. Is John there? John? John James? Where’s John? He’s doing well. We have some good people here. Chairman of Michigan Republican Party, Pete Hoekstra. Pete, thank you very much. A very special man, a great guy, Dr. Massad Boulos. Many of you know him. He is a very successful man. He happens to be the father of Tiffany’s husband Michael, who’s a very exceptional young guy and she’s an exceptional young woman and she’s going to have a baby, so that’s nice. Thank you for being here. Thank you very much. Thank you. Great honor and many other distinguished guests and we have some very distinguished Democrats in the room too and I really do appreciate you being here. That’s very nice, thank you. There’ll be a day when we’re going to work together. I hope we’re going to be able to work together. That’d be great. Good for everybody.
(12:03)
I’m here today to talk about a subject that has always been very dear to my heart, saving the US auto industry. That’s what I spoke about in Oakland many years ago. I said, they’re stealing your auto industry, years ago. They’re stealing your auto industry. You got to stop it. Well, they didn’t exactly listen, but we have to make that industry bigger, better, stronger and more dynamic than ever before and I’ve been reading about Detroit for so many years that it’s coming around, it’s coming around and never really got there. Everybody tries so hard, but if you make the auto industry bigger, better, stronger, you don’t have to worry about Detroit. It’ll be very good. It’ll come by its own. That would be non-artificial. That would be the way to do it, right? You make the auto industry thrive, bring it back to where it was 50, 60 years ago. You can do that too and that’s my goal and I’m laying out a policy that will absolutely do it. In my opinion, absolutely do it and I’ve been very good at this over my life.
(13:09)
My goal is to see US auto manufacturing even greater than it was in its prime and for Detroit and Michigan to be at the center of the action. For generations this city and state were the world capital of automotive production and American automakers rolled one iconic model off the line after the next, the Mustang, the Corvette, the Pontiac GTO. I had two of them actually. I had that GTO. Oh, I thought I was the hottest guy around. It was crazy. We didn’t have all of the foreign competition then. You were so proud to have a Corvette. Oh, if you had a Corvette. I never got a Corvette. I tell you, I feel I was left behind, but I had my GTO. I was something, man. I’d put that top down. See, in those days I didn’t mind when the hair waved. I’d go fast and that hair would be waving, that blonde hair and I’d say, who the hell can take me? Nobody. Today, I’m a little more careful I want cover up that little area up there. It’s a little bit soft up there. Cover it up. No, it was great, but you did, you had the greatest product. It was just fantastic. Right here in Detroit, Americans invented the muscle car and the minivan and the family SUV, so much and along the road you made the American automobile an inseparable part of the and it was inseparable, of the American dream. It was part of the American dream, but after decades and decades of Michigan auto workers giving our nation their very best, our leaders in Washington did their very worst for them. They were terrible. You lost nearly 4 million manufacturing jobs after globalist politicians gave us the twin disasters of NAFTA, which I terminated and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. That was a very expensive two things. Nearly a quarter of a million jobs were destroyed here, right here in Michigan alone. Think of it. A quarter of a million. 250,000 jobs, including 40% of all of the auto jobs and then it got to be much higher than that. Detroit was decimated as if by a foreign army. This was a foreign army invading us, but it was an army of business people, very brilliant business people, that took the candy out of our pockets just like you’d take it from a baby. That’s how easy it was for them. Factories were left in ruins. Beautiful hotels and theaters crumbled. More than 80,000 homes were abandoned. You see it outside.
(16:06)
By the time I came into office after our victory in 2016, the Michigan Auto Industry was on its knees begging for help, gasping and really it was at the last breaths of life and I had to move quickly. You were going to not have any auto industry here. It was going, it was all gone. It was just about over. They were going to move so fast that I let countries that were stealing our businesses know, you do that I’m going to do things to you you’re not going to believe. I’m going to put tariffs. They laid off a lot. They could have taken it. We were at a very vulnerable point. I let certain countries know that if you do that, I’m going to put tariffs on you and you’re going to get your asses kicked. I’m telling you and they laid off. They really laid off, but they laid off what? We had not very much left.
(16:57)
Just as I promised, I withdrew from the job killing Trans-Pacific Partnership in my very first week and the reason I did is that that would’ve absolutely destroyed your auto industry. You would’ve had none left. It was a disaster. If you remember, Hillary Clinton wanted it and Obama wanted it and then after she read the facts when I did it, she came out against it because she said he’s right. She was totally in favor of it, but when she said she came out actually and agreed with me and she said, I’m also against it, but I was there sort of like no tax on tips and then two months later, Kamala came out, no tax on tips and it didn’t play well for her. It didn’t play well for Hillary either, obviously.
(17:46)
I ended the disaster known as NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made by our country and replaced it with the brand new USMCA. Bob Lighthizer and his team did a great job. The best trade deal they say ever made. I actually think maybe our deal with China, but I don’t talk about that deal very much because of Covid, but we have a deal with China where they buy $50 billion worth of our product. That was a great deal. We had made a lot of good ones, but with the USMCA, that’s Mexico and Canada, we have massive incentives to make cars in the United States of America. I renegotiated Obama’s Korea trade deal, which was a disaster, to fully restore the protective tariff on foreign pickup trucks. The auto industry in this country makes most of its money from the pickup truck. Who would think, right, but we do great.
(18:36)
If we didn’t have that, you’d have no auto industry because that subsidizes other things and the only reason it does is that the tariff on every single one of the big… If you didn’t have the tariffs, if I didn’t put those tariffs, you would be inundated from all over the world and you wouldn’t have it. Every single one of the Detroit big three could right now and would right now guaranteed be out of business. 50% of their US sales are pickup trucks. Think of that, 50%. They make all their money with, almost all their money, I want to be very accurate because you got a lot of fake news back there. I want to be extremely accurate. They came to see you in Detroit. I’ll tell you, that’s a good thing because they’re going to hear some things today I think that are going to be very interesting.
(19:26)
Perhaps most importantly, I imposed a 27.5% tariff on all Chinese automobiles, which largely kept them out of the market. Meaning kept them out of the market and kept Detroit in business. In other words, I kept China cars, Chinese cars, out of America and we had to do it because when they come in, they take over everything and you would’ve had no car manufacturing at all and it was only me that did it. I met with a lot of resistance and remember this between the lobbyists and everything else, it’s brutal. It’s brutal. Getting people to go along with you is brutal. Even if it’s the wrong thing, they know it’s the wrong thing, but they get paid a lot of money. I just want to say, Michigan, you’re welcome because we have a little base to start on. If you look at Europe, Chinese cars have been absolutely drowning Europe, drowning it, it’s killing it, but because of me, they are not drowning America. You see very few of them because of the tariffs and when they do come in, they pay a lot of money.
(20:38)
The Biden administration is thinking of taking that tax off and if they take that tax off, you can wave goodbye to your auto industry and you have the worst union leader, maybe in the history of our country for any business. I don’t know him. Shawn Fain is a disaster. Your industry would be gone very quickly. Under my leadership, we created nearly half a million brand new manufacturing jobs, including 30,000 auto manufacturing jobs right away. We saved it and we got it going and that was nothing compared to what I’m talking about now. Nothing because we had Covid come in that final period and we had to focus on that. The share of cars sold that were domestically produced, increased for the first time in many years because it was going down, down, down and since I left, wait until you hear those numbers. The US trade deficit in automobiles dropped by $6.8 billion. Think of that and I had to do it on the fly. We had to do it fast because you were going to have no industry whatsoever.
(21:44)
Whatever you have now and it’s a fraction of what you used to have in the glory days. I call them the glory days. That was when we were the greatest in so many ways, US Steel. Look at it. They want to sell US Steel to a foreign country. I’m going to not let that happen. I hope the deal doesn’t close before then. I will not let that happen. We need our steel. I imposed a tremendous tariff on China and the steel. They were dumping steel all over the country and our steel mills were going at a business and I put a 50% tariff on and that largely stopped it. I think the people that like me the best are the steel people because I saved their industry. We wouldn’t have one steel plant in this country if I didn’t do that. There wouldn’t be one.
(22:33)
I had no wars, other than I finished off ISIS very quickly, but I had no wars. Whether you have wars or don’t have wars, when you have to make army tanks and when you have to make planes and everything else that you have to do is mostly steel and we don’t want to be in a position where we have a problem and we need China to help us out with steel. That could be a serious problem. Do you think they’d mind selling us some steel in the middle of a conflict? I don’t think we’ll have a conflict with China. I think we’ll get along with China and I think we’ll get along with Russia and I think we’ll get along with Ukraine and I think we’re going to get that one settled and I think we’re not going to have a problem with Israel. October 7th would never have happened. Russia would’ve never happened. They would’ve never gone into Ukraine had I been president, but under Kamala, we are now in a manufacturing recession, with manufacturing contracting in 22.
(23:35)
Think of this, it got smaller. In 22 out of the last 23 months, it got smaller. We’re losing jobs every single month. We have lost nearly 50,000 manufacturing jobs this year alone. Car sales are down by 38% since I left. The share of domestically produced cars sold has dropped significantly and the US trade deficit in automobiles has exploded by nearly $50 billion to an all-time high. The worst they’ve ever had it, right now. Your car industry is going out of business. It’s going out of business. Nothing to do with me. I stopped that. I stopped Mexico, which is becoming the second China. I stopped Mexico from taking your car plants and moving them into Mexico and taking all of that business, making it in Mexico, so we lose all those jobs in Michigan and South Carolina and other places, Tennessee, we have many places, but I think in terms of this because it’s been so badly treated.
(24:48)
This area, this state has been so badly treated by your politicians. Your stupid politicians what they’ve done to this state is incredible and it would’ve been easy to stop, but half of them are paid a lot of money by a lot of bad, well, a lot of people that don’t care about the country. They care about how much money they’re going to make, including lobbyists and others, making a lot of money. You ever see the money the lobbyists make? They make a lot, but they give a lot of it away. I wonder who they give it to? We’re not going to allow this horror to continue. The four-year-long nightmare for the American autoworker ends the day I take the oath of office. January 20th, it ends.
(25:41)
Yeah, a poll just came out today. As I was walking on, they said, sir, you are four points up in Michigan. I said, that’s all? They said by a poll that they called it a Democrat poll. It’s a poll that would normally be very negative, so if they say four points, that means more, but I think we’re doing well here and I think we’re doing well all over. We’re leading in every single state, every swing state, by actually in some cases a lot. Today, I am announcing a detailed plan to save the American auto industry and bring millions and millions of jobs back to our shores and very quickly. If you vote for Trump and you will see a mass exodus of manufacturing jobs, but from Mexico to Michigan, from Shanghai to Sterling Heights and from Beijing to right here in beautiful Detroit. Wait until you see Detroit. They’ll also be going to places like South Carolina, Tennessee and others. We have a lot of car-making states, a lot of parts-making states too and our car industry will have a renaissance, the likes of which we have never seen before in this country. We have never seen since the golden years.
(27:06)
It’s my goal to get our country on an automaking path where at some point in the near future, it will be bigger and more important than it ever was and even in its heyday. Many years ago, it was unbelievable. I think we can be bigger and more important because we have some very, very great assets and this is very personal for me. Personal. One of the reasons is because I’ve been talking about it for 20 years. I can’t believe it happened. When I was honored, that’s all I talked about. I was watching this happen. It was at that time Japan. Japan was just taking our cars like we were a bunch of babies. I always say candy from a baby. That’s how easy it was. Now, it’s Japan, but it’s China and it’s a lot of countries. This was one of the biggest reasons I ran for president in the first place. It was probably the auto industry that was most abused. You were the most abused. There were a lot of industries that were abused. We stopped it, but now I could put the brakes on. Not only stop, I now know the game a little better.
(28:15)
I had never been a politician before. I got to the White House. I said, yeah, I’ve never done this before, but I had to learn and I had some great people. Bob Lighthizer was great, our trade representative, but we had some people that I didn’t like. I wouldn’t have picked, in retrospect. We had some clinkers, but you have to understand, I just got there. I was only in Washington 17 times and I never stayed over, so I wasn’t a part of Washington society. It wasn’t my thing. I was a New York person, a developer, did great and I knew New York, but I didn’t know Washington. I came. I had to rely on people. Sometimes I’d rely on RINOs and that’s what I’d get. I’d get a RINO and that wasn’t so good, but we had mostly great people, but we had some ones that I would not have again. We’re going to finish the job that we really brilliantly started because we had numbers. The ambassador gave you some of them. I don’t want to bore you by going through it, but he gave you some numbers that were unprecedented. I intend for the triumph of the American auto industry to be among my greatest legacies. I want it to be a legacy. I want American companies to not only dominate the American market, but also the foreign markets as well. They buy so of our cars. It’s so horrible, but they only buy them if they’re made in their countries. China, I don’t object. Look, President Xi was and I would say is a very good friend. We broke up a little bit. The way friendships break up, a thing called the China virus broke us up. I think that’s understandable, right? Cost the world about $50 trillion and tens of millions of lives all over the world. I think that’s a reason, but no, I’ve always had a very good relationship with him. Very, very strong, smart man. He’s strong and smart, meaning he wants to take your auto industry and so does every other leader of a country. They want to take your industry, all of our industry and we’re not going to do that. We won’t let them play that game and it’s not even hard and you’ll understand that in a moment.
(30:33)
I want German car companies to be American car companies. I want them to build plants in America. Otherwise I’d rather not have their cars here. Instead of American workers worrying about losing their jobs to foreign nations, I want foreign nations to be worried about losing their jobs to America. That’s going to happen. It’s going to happen. It’s going to happen and I hope the Democrats will go along with us, but we’ll get it done one way or the other. I hope they’re going to go along with us. It’s so good. It’s like so many things they don’t like, like voter id.
(31:07)
Why aren’t they approving voter id? Democrats don’t want voter id. You know why because they want to cheat. I thought I was seeing things. I didn’t hear that. When I first started this, I’d say, the Democrats will not approve voter id and it’s only gotten worse. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, just passed a bill. He signed a bill that you’re not even allowed to ask anybody whether or not they have voter id. Not only can’t you use it, you can’t even ask. I think it’s a crime or something. I could ask the Secretary of State. No, I think it’s a crime. I think it’s a crime. If you ask somebody, do you have id, voter id? Let’s lock that guy up. In other words, it’s not

Donald Trump (32:00):

… Not a crime to vote illegally, but it’s a crime to ask whether or not, there’s only one reason for that. You know the reason? Cheating, they want to cheat. There’s only one reason. It’s crazy. No country in the world has a policy like that. Mail-in voting is all gone all over the world. All these things that we still fight over, they’re all gone. So we have to win a big election and we’re going to straighten it out, but we got to straighten it out because you have two things. You have borders and you have good elections. And it would be nice to have a free press, which we don’t have at all. We have a terrible press. But those three things we have and we have to straighten it out.
(32:41)
So here is the deal that I will be offering to the world, to companies outside of our world, big companies, powerful companies that have become powerful because we were stupid. We were stupid. We allowed them to come in and raid and rape our country. That’s what they did. Oh, he used the word rape. That’s right, I used the word rape. They raped our country. The United States will give you the lowest taxes, the lowest energy cost. We have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country in the world, and it’s the best. It’s the best. We have the most and we have the highest quality. We have the lowest regulatory burdens and they were going to be made low. I cut regulations more than any president in history. In a four-year term, I cut more than any president by four times they say, four times.
(33:34)
I let the country do what they have to do. A lot of those regulations have been put back on by Crooked Joe and by Kamala. And it angers me so much because it’s so bad. People shaking my hand backstage, “Sir, we had the best four years we’ve ever had and now they’re dying. They think they’re going…” So many people that tell me they’re going out of business now. And free access to the best and biggest market on the planet, we’re going to give anybody that comes in free access to the best and biggest market anywhere on the planet that’s here. But we got to keep it that way because if we keep going like this, we’re not going to have the best or biggest market for long, but only if you make your products here in America. In other words, you get all of these assets, but you have to make your product here in America and you have to hire American workers.
(34:23)
And if these companies don’t take the deal, we’re lowering the taxes way down, then they’ll have to pay a tax or tariff when they send their car or product into the United States. And we will use the hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff dollars to benefit the American citizens and pay down our debt. In short, a period of time, it’s going to be very quick. Think of it in a short period of time, our deficit of about $1.8 trillion, I’ve heard it was 2 trillion. It’s never been anywhere close to this, by the way. $2 trillion a year will be reduced to practically nothing, and eventually our country will be making substantially more money over and above cost, and we will start a massive debt reduction and also further tax cuts. In other words, what I’m doing is I took it from almost 40%, your taxes, I reduced them to 21% so that small corporations, everybody, even inheritance tax or a death tax, if you have a small business and you want to pass it on to your son and daughter, if you love them.
(35:39)
If you don’t love them, I would say just don’t even bother listening to this part. Is there anybody in the group that does not love their children where you want to raise your hand and say, “Sir, please don’t waste our time with this.” But on the assumption you want to leave it to your children, then you have no estate tax or death tax. They want to end that immediately. And it really pertained to farms where a farm could be valuable, but they don’t have cash. They have a valuable farm and they love their farm and they want to be farmers. It’s a great way of life. People love it. They wouldn’t want to do anything else but they’re left the farm and then they have to pay a tremendous tax, and they borrow the money from the bank and within two, three years, many almost, I guess 62% of the time they say they end up losing their farm to the banks.
(36:29)
I got rid of that. There’s no estate or death tax at all for the farmers and small business owners. So they want to end that. This is a big deal, but I brought it down from almost 40% to 21% and now… and that makes us very competitive in the world. Don’t forget the world is like states used to be. People will take their businesses and they’re loyal to their stockholders and in many cases the people that run the big businesses are not American. They couldn’t care less for our country. They follow the dollar or they follow… we better keep them following the dollar by the way, we’re going to keep them following the dollar. That’ll be another thing because we’re losing that fast. We are losing that fast, but we’re going to bring it down and we brought it down to 21, that made us competitive.
(37:20)
Not the best at all, but competitive. Now I’m bringing it down to 15%, but that’s totally subject to you building your product, making your product in America. And I had calls, so we’re getting it down to 15 and now you’re just about the most competitive other than certainly for a big country, but you just about the most competitive at 15. That’s the beauty. They’re going to all move back. They’re going to all move back. They’re all coming back and then we’re going to protect them so they don’t get hurt with tariffs on people that aren’t building here, and they’re going to come in and they’re going to build here because they don’t want to pay those stiff tariffs. So we will build this policy and it’s called Build it in America plan. It’s build it in America because when foreign leaders and CEOs call me up to complain about our tariffs, my answer will be very simple.
(38:15)
Build it in America, you don’t have any tariffs. Build it right here in Detroit, you don’t have any tariffs. Build it in Dearborn or Lansing or Grand Rapids or Flint. You don’t have any taxes. You don’t have any taxes or tariffs or anything. We’re going to take that. We’re going to take that. Remember we started at 40. Everyone said you’ll never get it down to 30. I got it down to 21. And that caused the biggest renaissance in the history of our country. We had the greatest period of success in the history of our country. We did more revenue at 21% than we did at close to 40%. People were going wild, businesses were flourishing. Small businesses were going through the roof. Big businesses, I was allowing them, they’d have hundreds of billions of dollars. Apple as an example, they brought in hundreds of billions of dollars. We had restrictive covenants where they couldn’t bring money back into our country.
(39:19)
Two reasons. The tax was too high. It was so ridiculous, nobody would do it. You had to pay a 50, 60% tax so you bring in money, so they said, “Well, we’ll just leave it there and we’ll develop in Europe or Asia,” wherever the money was. But think of this, we brought in trillions of dollars because I made it possible. I made the tax rate fair, reasonable, like a reasonable person would bring it in for a reasonable tax. And also I made the bureaucracy very easy. They had to hire four different law firms to get their money back if they wanted to bring it back. So what I’m proposing very simply then is a 15% Made in America corporate tax rate, cutting it from 21% all the way down to 15%, but only for those who make their product in the USA. It’s very simple and beautiful. And I was called by a couple of the top people in Wall Street, I sort of know a lot of them. They said, “Who gave you that idea? It’s so simple.”
(40:24)
I said, “It’s a great idea. I have another one coming up for you that you’re going to like just as much. You’re going to love maybe more. Oh, you got a big one coming toward the end. I want to save it for the end. This way you’re going to stay around and you’re going to be so happy.” He says, “Pins and needles, you’re sitting, right?” No, I have one coming that I think is just incredible. But this is something that is going to revolutionize our country because it’s not only auto companies, it’s also others, but I think in particular this is going to be something that is going to really lead to the Renaissance in Detroit and in our country. But in Detroit, this place will be booming. This place is going to be booming. And when you couple that with what I’m going to say in a little while, it’s going to really be booming.
(41:12)
So USA based car makers and manufacturers will also be rewarded with expanded research and development tax credits, very substantial where they will be able to write off 100% of their cost of heavy machinery and other equipment necessary to build a plant. In the first year, and full expensing for manufacturing investments and all helping to build the sprawling state-of-the-art plants. Our country needs to be an industrial superpower in the world. I have a friend who makes plants, he builds plants. That’s what he does better than anybody in the world. And he’s a supporter actually, I said to him, “I want to see a plant. I want to see a really great auto plant. Where would we go? Let’s go see one.” And he said, “Well, we’ll have to go to Mexico.” I said, “What?” “We have to go to Mexico.” I said, “I want to see Mexico. I want to see here.” He said, “Well, the big ones are really built in Mexico. They’re building some really big ones right now.”
(42:15)
Your stupid union leader, Sean Fane or whatever the hell his name is, this stupid stupid guy, he’s playing around all electric cars, everything else. Did you see your numbers in the last few months? What’s happening? You’re losing your whole business. They’re building the biggest plants in the entire world. This guy builds them. That’s what he’s good at. If you said build an apartment, he wouldn’t want to do it, he couldn’t do it, but he can build an auto plant, all the top of the line, all automated. You press a button and the plant opens up, biggest in the world, and who’s building them? China. They’re building them at levels that nobody’s ever seen before right across the border and they think they’re going to make cars there and they’re going to put you all out of business and they’re going to sell them across the border and they’re not going to have a tax. No, they’re wrong.
(43:07)
They’re going to pay a 100% or maybe even a 200% tariff because we’re not going to let them come in to our country and destroy what’s left of our auto industry because it’s a failing industry, just like it’s a failing country right now. We’re a failing country. We’re a nation in decline. I hope, you know that, doesn’t make me feel good to say it, but we’re not going to be a nation in decline for very long. Perhaps the most important element of my plan to make America extraordinarily wealthy again has to do with reciprocity. It’s a word that’s very important in my plan because we generally don’t charge tariffs. I started that process. It was so great with the vans and the small trucks, et cetera, I told you about, but we really don’t charge. I mean, China will charge us a 200% tariff. Brazil is a big charger. The biggest charger of all is India. India’s a very big charger.
(44:06)
We have a great relationship with India. I did, and with especially the leader, Modi, is a great leader. Great man, really is a great man. He’s brought it together. He’s done a great job, but they probably charge as much. I mean, I think they’d probably charge more than in many ways China, but they do it with a smile. They do it sort of a nicer charge. They say, “Thank you so much for purchasing from India.” Harley Davidson came to the White House a long time ago during my third year or second year, and I met with them and they were based, I guess in Wisconsin, and I said, “How’s business?” “Good, good.” “What are the bad countries?” “Well, India is very tough.” And they gave me some others. “Why?” “Tariffs.” I said, “What are they?” And they had said like 150%, some massive amount. I said, “So do you sell many motorcycles and because you think people want to buy a Harley, right?” “Anyway, no, we sell very few in India, but they want us to go there.”
(45:12)
They said, “If you go there and build your plant there, we’re not going to charge you anything. I mean, you can do whatever you want.” They said, “I don’t like that.” And lo and behold, I see they went and they built the plant and now they do their business with India. They probably do it outside of India too, plenty. They built a very big plant. Many countries, they do that and then all of a sudden you hear that they’re leaving Milwaukee or they’re leaving wherever they may be located. It’s very sad to see it, and it’s so simple. I mean, this isn’t like Elon with his rocket ships that land within 12 inches on the moon where they want it to land or he gets the engines back. That was the first I realized. I said, “Who the hell did that?” I saw engines about the four years ago.
(46:01)
These things were coming cylinders, no wings, no nothing, and they’re coming down very slowly, landing on a raft in the middle of the ocean someplace with a circle. Boom. Reminded me of the Biden circles that he used to have, right? He’d have eight circles and he couldn’t fill them up. But then I heard he beat us with the popular vote. I don’t know. I don’t know. Couldn’t fill up the eight circles. I always loved those circles. They were so beautiful. They were so beautiful to look at. In fact, the person that did them, that was the best thing about his… the level of that circle was great, but they couldn’t get people. So they used to have the press stand in those circles because they couldn’t get the people. Then I heard we lost. Oh, we lost. No, we’re never going to let that happen again. But we’ve been abused by other countries. We’ve been abused by our own politicians, really more than other countries. I can’t blame them. We’ve been abused by people that represent us in this country.
(47:01)
Some of them stupid, some of them naive and some of them crooked frankly. But interestingly, it’s often those allies that we consider to be friends that have been the greatest abusers. We have some great abusers. I’ll give you an example. The European Union, sounds so nice, the European Union of countries. Oh, it’s so nice. They’re brutal. We have a $200 billion deficit with them now higher than that, 250 something. And like I asked at the time, Angela, “Angela, how many Chevrolets do we have in the middle of Berlin?” “Oh, I do not know. Perhaps none.” “You’re right, Angela, you’re right. How about Frankfurt? How many do we have? How many Fords do we have in Frankfurt?” “Oh, I don’t think any.” And yet they send their cars to us like a bunch of dummies we are. BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen by the millions and millions and millions, and we’re not doing that. We’re not doing that crap anymore, okay? Now they’re going to have to play by our rules. They’re going to have to play by our rules. But China, of course, was the biggest abuser.
(48:20)
I mean, they were a professional abuser. They did things to us and they go down as a developing nation. We are a developing nation. Well, we’re a developing nation too. Just take a look at Detroit. Detroit’s a developing area, hell of a lot more than most places in China. So we’re not going to let this happen any longer, and I don’t think it’ll be possible for bad politicians to stop it. I don’t think so because we’ve suffered too long and too hard, and I fixed much of it during my four years, but felt that during the COVID period it would not be the right time to be going doing this with countries. I renegotiated with Japan, I renegotiated with South Korea, I renegotiated with many, but with the COVID, everybody was just literally devastated by that scourge. It devastated. It was not the right time, so I had to slow it up a little bit. I was hitting them really hard. Shinzo Abe was great. He was assassinated.
(49:28)
What a great man he was. But I went to Shinzo, I said, “Shinzo,” I got to know him very well. He was really a friend of mine. He was a great man actually, loved by the Japanese people. He got sick. He had to take a leave of absence for a period of time, but he was going back and he would’ve gone back and easily gone back and he was just getting ready to do it. He was much better. I think he was probably cured of what he had and he was going back. But I said to him, “Shinzo, we have to talk about trade. I’m sorry to bring it up. I’m sorry. This is the most one-sided deal I’ve ever seen. You send millions of cars to us and we can’t send you a car.” They didn’t accept any of our cars. “You send all of your farm products to us and you don’t want to accept our farm products. I’m sorry, Shinzo, we’re going to have to negotiate something.” He looked at me and goes, “I know.” I said, “What do you know?”
(50:26)
He said, “Well, I know that you were going to be coming back to me, and I know that it hasn’t been fair.” I said, “Well, how did it happen?” He said, “Well, we’d ask for things and the Americans would agree to it. Your representatives, your presidents,” Republicans too, by the way, I’m not talking just Democrats. We were friends, he would say this, I probably wouldn’t say it if you were around because it’s not very nice, but he told the truth. I said, “How did you get these deals?” He said, “We would ask and they would approve, and we were amazed ourselves, but I knew you’d be coming to see me.” And I said, “I have to see you Shinzo.” And we made a new deal with Japan, but we were stuck with an old one, so I couldn’t negotiate as good as I normally would, but we made it palatable and we were going to really make it palatable when this one came up. But he was great.
(51:28)
But he looked at me, I’ll never forget it, quite, he said, he called me Donald. “Donald, I knew that you would be coming back because I knew that you understood it.” But he also said that other people didn’t. Actually, it was quite sad, actually, and it’s that way. I would look at these deals and say, “Who negotiated these deals?” They were so bad. It’s amazing that we even exist, but we have 36 trillion in debt. We do have 36 trillion. We can’t forget that. So it’s not like, “Oh gee, we’ve been a little bit unlucky or something.” No, we’ve been just for years and years and years we’ve been accumulating. We’d have these deficits that are monstrous. We had five, six, seven, 800 billion deficit with China, just alone with China. And today it was announced we have the highest deficit we’ve ever had. Almost $ 2 trillion. Think of that. And we have the highest deficit we’ve ever had with China, and that won’t last long. It’s not going to last long.
(52:41)
We’ll be able to do something about it because china wants to do business with us, but they think we’re stupid. They think we’re stupid people. And then they see a president, and then they see a person that is representing the Democrat party and got no votes and was the first one out. She was the first one out. I think of it, she was the first one out, she never made it to Iowa. 22 people running, and she was the first one to quit and now she’s running, and it’s all right, but nobody’s ever had to run against two people before. First I had to run against him. Then we had the debate and his numbers weren’t good, and it looked like he was going to lose. So they said, “You’re going to lose and we want you out.” And eventually he agreed to go out. He didn’t want to. He’s a very angry man, by the way, and he hates her. And then it was a question.
(53:36)
They have a person in this state who some people talked about, they had a lot of people, but they had about 12 people and they put her in, 12 people plus her. She was number 13. She was rated number 13 too. There are 12 people that they wanted more, but they didn’t want to be politically incorrect and they chose her and we’re running against her. But if she gets in, it’ll be a disaster for this country. Basically, if a country or any country is charging us tariffs, very important, reciprocal. If they’re charging us tariffs for a certain product or tariffs at all, if they’re charging us tariffs at all, which almost all of them do, then we will likewise charge them tariffs and we will quickly reciprocate. In other words, we have countries that are charging us 150% tariff and we charge them 2%. And I actually went to a politician, a senator from the Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, you’ll figure out, because he wasn’t able to run because I wouldn’t endorse him because I called him the anti-tariff person.
(54:49)
I thought he was not a bright person, and he was one of the few that said, “No, no, we cannot charge tariffs.” I said, “But they’re charging us 150%, so can we charge them 100%, sir?” “No, we can’t.” “Why? It’s not free trade.” I said, “Really not free trade. Well, what about them?” “No, sir. It’s not free trade.” “Can we charge them 50? They’re charging us 150. Can we charge them 50?” He goes, “No, sir, it’s not free trade.” I said, “You’re either the dumbest human being I’ve ever met, or you’re a crook, one or the other.” And he’s no longer a senator. He decided not to run, but I think it was a disgrace. I had a lot of problems with him. But basically one of two things will happen. They’re going to call us or I will call them and say, “Look, we can to play this game, or we can save a lot of energy and pain and bookkeeping, and we’ll just all drop the tariffs, right? We’ll just all drop the tariffs.
(55:59)
Or we can get paid royally every time a shipment of their goods comes to our shores and we’ll make a lot of money. One way or the other, we win.” But its reciprocity will probably, I think for the most part, they’re going to drop the tariffs right now. They’re not going to drop them. We have countries that are charging us a 100%, 150%. Think of it, and we charged them nothing. It’s been a pillaging of our country. It’s been a terrible, terrible thing. This has been going on for a long time. I started changing it a lot fast. I changed it with a lot of countries. A lot of countries don’t like me. I get always bad publicity. This one doesn’t like me. Germany doesn’t like me. A lot of countries don’t like me. They say, “Who do you like better? Sleepy Joe Biden or Trump?” “Oh, I like Biden better.” Yeah, because he didn’t let them do what they’re doing. He doesn’t have a clue. The guy, he just goes to sleep at four o’clock every damn day.
(57:03)
He doesn’t have a clue and they’re destroying our country. You see, that’s the real threat to democracy, stupid people. That’s the threat. Our biggest threat to democracy is stupid people. But there’s a third thing that can happen, and that’s the fact that if they want to avoid this payment, and this is the best thing of all, they can come in and build a plant or a factory in the United States and spend all of their money and build. And I don’t care what country it is, and they’re going to hire American workers, and they’re going to have a factory in the United States, and then you don’t have to pay a tariff, and we want to be beautiful. We’ll have job numbers like you’ve never had before. And that’s actually to me, the best of the three things. So it’s a very simple thing to understand, and they’ve been doing it for years, but they do it very quietly and they do it intelligently, and a lot of people don’t see what they’re doing.
(58:03)
As an example, you want to sell cars in China, they tell you, “Build your plant in China. If you don’t build a plant in China, we’re going to charge you a tariff. You’re never going to pay it.” So a lot of people go over to China and they build their plant. The only question I have is where do we stop with reciprocity? Because frankly, we have much more to offer and they’ve been screwing us for so many years that we’re allowed to get some of that back. So I say, “Do we want to stop on an even basis? We won’t do this. We won’t do that.” Or do we want to stop on a basis, “You don’t do it to us, but we’re going to still do it to you a little bit.” And that’s where I am, I think. And in way they owe it to us. In a way they owe it to us because they’ve been taking advantage of us for decades and in a way, and it’s injured us. We’re injured.
(59:01)
We’re an injured country from trade. And with NATO, when I got there, 28 countries they had at the time and only seven were paid. The rest of them weren’t paying, or they were paying a smaller amount than they were supposed to pay, including Germany, by the way. Germany wasn’t paid. Can you believe? Because they said, “We’re stupid. We’re going to take care of them anyway. Why should they pay?” A lot of the countries felt that way, and I made them pay. I said, “You got to pay.” And one person at a very close meeting, the press knew about it a little bit, but they never reported it because it was a good thing, not a bad thing. So naturally you don’t hear about that. But it was at a meeting and he stood up, the head of a country, one of the countries. He said, “So does that mean that if we don’t pay, you will not protect us from Russia?” Used to be the Soviet Union, now it’s Russia, sort of the same thing. I said, “That’s what it means.” ” You will not protect us?” I said, “Are you delinquent?”
(01:00:03)
“Yes. Let’s say we’re delinquent.” “I will not protect you under any form. You will not be protected.” And the following day, we took in billions and billions of dollars. The money came in and Stoltenberg, the Secretary General, a good man, he said, “It was the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen.” Obama would come and make a speech and leave. Bush would come and make a speech and leave. Trump would come and look at the statement and say, “Beat it.” Because we were almost paying for all of NATO. So we were getting screwed on NATO and screwed on trade. A double. Nobody else would’ve done this, “This is crazy. So we’re protecting you and you’re taking advantage of us on trade.” I said, “Sorry, we’re not going to take it anymore.” But the money came. We took in hundreds of billions of dollars in NATO, hundreds of billions. And by the way, they should be paying three to 4%, not 2%, okay?
(01:01:06)
They’re 2%, they should be at much higher than that. But that’s up for whoever is going to be a next president. I think Kamala, it’s not going to be high on her list. I don’t think anything that we’re talking about today is high on her list. The whole country is going to be like, you want to know the truth, it’ll be like Detroit. Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she’s your president, you’re going to have a mess on your hand. She destroyed San Francisco. She destroyed, along with Newsom, California, and we’re not going to let her do that to this country. We’re going to let it happen. So we are the piggy bank that everyone wants, that someday we will continue along the path. Really, it’s been an amazing path. It’s been a horrible period of time, but almost the last four years, I will tell you that if I get elected, we will be a piggy bank stronger than ever before, but we will be a fool no longer.
(01:02:12)
We will, if you get her, lose our wealth, we’re going to lose our power, and we’ll also lose our reserve currency status, which will be like really losing a war. If we lose that, it’ll be horrible. But we’re losing it right now. You’re losing your reserve currency. The dollar. The dollar. Look, China wants to take that over. That’s one of the many things that they want to take over. We can deal with China. We can deal with China, and we can deal with Russia and we can deal with North Korea. Obama, prior to taking over, when I took over, it’s this ritual, at a meeting and he said, “The biggest problem is North Korea.” And very quickly, it was nasty for a while, little rocket man, a lot of insults. Remember when he said, “I have a red button on my desk.” I said, “I have one too, but mine’s bigger and mine works.” Remember that?
(01:03:13)
He said that. And a lot of people were saying, “This is getting to be very heated.” And then he called and he wanted to meet, and we met, and I got along great with him. I hate to say it because the press goes crazy when you say that, but that’s a good thing. It’s a good thing. Not a bad thing. A lot of nuclear weapons, but we got along very well. You had no problem. Nobody was threatened after that. They’re threatened now. You could very well end up in World War III right now. You’re very close to it. You’re closer than ever. This is the closest we’ve ever come to World War III. You are so close to it because you have incompetent people in the White House. So that would reduce us if we lose the dollar. That would reduce us to Third World status very quickly. But again, I would come into play and tariffs would come into play,

Donald Trump (01:04:00):

And I’d call those countries that want to stay away, but they do business. They come in and they take our money and they take our jobs like we’re, like just so easily, and I would call them and I’d say if a country, let’s say, ready to go to China with their currency or someplace else, but China’s about 99% of the problem in all fairness, I would say to them, if you do that, I’m going to hit you with tariffs like you’ve never seen before. Or I’m going to not let you trade with the United States and I’m going to also hit you with tariffs, double whammy if you get anything through, but you’re not because we’re not going to do any business with you. And they will then call us and they will say, sir, we have decided that we love the dollar very much and we’re going to stay. That’s what they will say every single time.
(01:04:50)
So tariffs are a very important thing. They need a PR agent to straighten out that word. If I was Mr. Tariff, I would say, please get me a PR agent. I have to straighten out. It’s one of the most beautiful words in the whole world. It’s going to make us wealthy again. The other word is reciprocity is going to make us wealthy again. We’re going to be a very wealthy country very quickly, very, very quickly. Our greatest wealth, probably proportionately, was in the 1880s and 90s and the early 1900s where we had so much cash. They would set up committees. They didn’t know what to do with their wealth. We had such wealth in this country. They didn’t know what to do with their wealth. They had no, they would set up, we had so much money all from tariffs.
(01:05:41)
There was no income tax. And then they went to the income tax stuff and it was a whole different story. Then you had the depression. A lot of people said, oh, tariffs maybe caused it. It didn’t. It wasn’t. Tariffs came in in 1932 after the depression. They tried putting tariffs on to see if they could save. They said, we got to save this thing. But it was long gone. It was gone. I will do this with each and every abandoning country. If they abandon us, meaning they abandon our currency and our reserve currency will be stronger than ever before. We’ll have everybody in there. Everybody will be happy to be in there, including China because I’ll tell China the same thing. If you want to play games with us, we’re not going to trade with you. They make a trillion dollars a year with us. They built our military. They make so much money.
(01:06:30)
I say, we’re not going to do any business. We’ll go cold turkey. A lot of people would like to do that anyway, but we’re going to go to cold turkey and we’re going to go with 100% and 150% tariffs. So if anything does get through, you’re going to have to pay tariffs. China’s very smart. I’ll tell you, when I put the tariffs on the steel, they were very unhappy, but they didn’t tell me. They said, “It doesn’t matter. We’re China.” I said, “Oh, it doesn’t bother them. So then ask them for more.” That was my initial reaction. We started at 25%. I said, “They said it doesn’t matter.” And I said, “All right, so ask them for more.” So we asked them for more, 10%. It didn’t bother them. That’s what they said, but it did bother them. But they’re great players, they’re great poker players.
(01:07:17)
It didn’t bother them. I said, “Well, ask them for more. Ask them for more, more until it bothers them.” And finally, I got a call from President Xi. He said, “You’re killing us with the tariffs.” And then we got along after that. It’s very strange. But they’re great poker players, they’re great negotiators, all these countries are great negotiators. The only one that isn’t is the US. We’re the dumb country. We’re like the pot of gold that’s rapidly shrinking. So very much like I told them that if they buy oil from Iran, I would not be trading with them. Iran was broke when I left office, and I don’t want them to be broke. I want them to be a strong country. I just don’t want them to have a nuclear weapon. It’s very simple and you protect Israel and frankly you protect the Middle East. I want to protect the Middle East, the whole Middle East, and I hate to see this death to everybody.
(01:08:17)
People that have nothing to do with anything are being killed all over the place on both sides. Nobody wants that. We have to protect everybody. And China didn’t buy any oil. I said, “If you buy one barrel of oil from Iran, one barrel,” I said, “Then you’re going to not do any business with the United States and we’re going to impose tariffs if you do get something through. Very substantial, over 100%.” And they said, “We’ll pass.” I told this to President Xi. He said, “We’ll pass.” They didn’t do any business. And Iran was, and I said this to many countries, by the way, not just China. I mean, many countries treat us worse than China. You want to really know the truth, but China seems to be the one we talk about. But before I came along, nobody talked about China. They had a free pass. They were going, run silent, run low, right? You know that expression? Submarine. Nobody knew. But I woke up our country a little bit, but Iran was broke. They had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah and I didn’t want to see them broke. I want them to be thriving, but I just had to negotiate. The only problem was he was the only problem. The election took place and it was very shocking to a lot of people. And when they took over, they didn’t do anything. They didn’t do anything. They actually did the opposite. They allowed everybody to go and buy oil. They allowed everybody to do all of those things.
(01:09:56)
And Iran became very wealthy again. They now have $300 billion in cash. They’re very wealthy. They control Iraq, which was a stupid move going Iraq. I remember I said, “Don’t do it. Don’t do it, don’t do it.” But I said it as a civilian, then they did it. I said, “Okay, you’ve done it. Keep the oil.” They didn’t do that either. So we go in, we blow up countries and then we leave. We got nothing except dead people all over the place on both sides. How stupid are we? That was a Cheney deal and a Bush. How stupid are we? Not just Democrats, it’s both. I’m equally angry at both because we have humanity to think about also. You do. You have humanity to think about and all of these things, they should have never happened. Ukraine should have never happened. October 7th should have never, should have never happened.
(01:10:53)
If you had smart people at the White House that knew something, a little bit of something, it wouldn’t have happened. Think of the world, how different it would be. You wouldn’t have Ukraine-Russia. You wouldn’t have had October 7th. You wouldn’t have this horrible thing that’s going on. You wouldn’t have had inflation. You wouldn’t have had the worst, most embarrassing day in our history. We were leaving Afghanistan. I’m the one that got him down, but I would’ve kept Bagram. You know why I would’ve kept Bagram? It was one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons. One hour away. So you see the ideas and the policy are important, but the most important thing of all is the messenger. Because I could give that same message to a stiff and it wouldn’t resonate at all with the other side. You have to have the right messenger. Somebody said, “Oh, we love Trump policy, but we don’t like Trump.” I think they do. They said that women don’t like me. I think women love me because they want to be safe and with me, they’re safe. With other people they’re not safe. It’s true.
(01:11:58)
So remember, I want tariffs, but a very, very big, easy and uncomplicated part of it is reciprocity because that comes along with it very simply. And all tariffs against our nation must come off. They have to come off. They got to come off immediately because we’re going to meet them with an equal tariff and they will come off for the most part. But if they don’t, they have to pay a big price. So next, in addition to this rather easy thing to understand, by the way, does everyone understand this? Does everybody, do you understand? Is there anybody that doesn’t understand it? Would you please raise your hand? Raise your hand. Does anybody not understand it? See, how simple is that? I’d like to see the person. I really don’t sir. Then they have a front-page story and we had a couple of dummies in the room.
(01:12:50)
But we will implement further protections for critical industries that are fundamental to our national interests, and those include above all steel and the car industry. The car industry is critical to us. We can’t fight a war if we can’t make cars and trucks and engines and transmissions and drive trains. Surrendering our car industry is not an option. We have to make our car industry brilliant again. We have to make it bigger. I’m going to make it bigger than it was ever before. Now I’m going to make it real, very quick. It’s going to go, but to bring it to that level, I guess I’ll need a little more time, but I won’t have that time. But I’m going to hand it over to people. We’re going to make this country so strong and it’s going to be so much easier to run, and I think we’re going to end up actually having a lot of support from the other party. I really believe that. I think it’s too basic. It’s too basic.
(01:13:50)
So as I said, China is currently building gigantic auto plants in Mexico, and they think that they’re going to sell all of these cars into the United States, which would destroy Michigan. Totally destroy your state, but it’s not going to happen. Not going to happen. Not even close. They might as well stop building the damn plants. They are giants. Sir, you really have to see them. I said, “I don’t want to see them.” I will impose whatever tariffs are required, 100%, 200%, 1000%. They’re not going to sell any cars into the United States with those plants. They’re building them close to our border so that they can have easy shipping because they’re used to having stupid people to deal with. We’re not going to let it happen. Those jobs are coming back to Michigan and they’re coming back to other states and they’re coming back to our country and they’re going to make America great again. That’s it.
(01:14:48)
And to that end, I’m announcing today that upon taking office, I will formally notify Mexico and Canada of my intention to invoke the six-year renegotiation provisions of the USMCA that I put in. That was the hardest thing I had to get. They didn’t want that. They wanted to have it long, but I wanted to because there’s always little tricks they want to play. I said, “Nope. I want to be able to renegotiate in six years, otherwise we’re not making the deal.” And I got it and it’s coming due very soon. Ooh, I’m going to have a lot of fun and that’ll address these concerns and it’ll also seek strong new protections against trans shipments so that China and other countries cannot smuggle their products and auto parts into the United States tax-free through Mexico to the detriment of our workers and our supply chains.
(01:15:41)
They smuggle this stuff in. They don’t pay anything. We’re going to have very strong language on that. It’s not hard once you know about it, but nobody, no politician knows about it. And when they signed the NAFTA deal, there were some mistakes made. Typos, like typos. There were mistakes made and they were going to take care of it the following day. 30 years later, they said whatever happened, like mistakes like on the numbers, which were always against us. Nobody ever did anything about it except me. I terminated NAFTA. That’s a pretty big thing. A lot of people said it would be impossible to do. I got it done and we have a great deal. Now what we have to do is make it much better even and we’ll be able to do that very shortly, but while I have the build it in America plan, Kamala Harris has the build it in China plan.
(01:16:33)
This is really a build it in China plan. She’s going to destroy our country. Her plan is so stupid. Every policy she has rewards companies for shipping jobs overseas. Most significantly Kamala is a giant tax hiker. The tax queen they call her is demanding a shocking, I don’t even know. To be honest with you, after watching her on 60 Minutes and on watching that horrible statement that she made, they call it a word salad. I don’t really like those words because it was really worse than that.
(01:17:05)
But after watching that, I don’t think she’s interested in 33. I don’t think she has any idea what’s happening. Okay. I think she’s dumber than hell, and we’ve had enough of that for four years. We’re not going to have it any longer because we’re not going to be a country if we have it. You will see that. You’ve got to see, no you’ve got to see. And to think that a member of the media under this big press corps where they get free licensing, they shouldn’t have free licensing when they do that and they change her answer, they take it out, throw it away, and put in a totally different answer in order to protect her and they get caught. CBS should lose their license. They have a license.
(01:17:56)
They have a license, which is worth billions of dollars and they pay nothing. All of these networks, they’re all crooked as hell. You saw that with ABC. They go after me, not her. They go after JD. How good is JD doing? Isn’t he doing good? They go after JD, but not this character, this character that calls himself a knucklehead. I’ve never seen that in the debate. He said, well, he said knuckle. I don’t want to say I’m a knucklehead because I say, well, I’m not quoting him. They’ll say, Trump just called himself. That’s how crooked they are. So I say, well, actually, it’s amazing that he calls himself a knucklehead. Normally I’d say, he calls, so I don’t want to do that because if I say that, they’re going to say, see, Trump called himself a knucklehead. No, I don’t call myself a knucklehead. I call myself somebody that wants to make our country great again. Very simple.
(01:18:52)
The tax queen is demanding a shocking 33% tax hike on all domestic production. That means that everybody’s going to leave our country and go to another country where they can pay 15, 16, 18, 19%. It’s very simple. It’s not that complicated. She wants the largest capital gains tax, largest gains tax. Think of this in the history of our country. She even plans to tax unrealized capital gains. Think of it, unreal. Think of what that means. It’s an unrealized gain and she wants to tax it. How do you do that? Okay. She wants to tax, and a lot of people are rich, but they have no money. They have good land or they have something or they put all their money into their business because they want to have a business that’s going to get better and better and grow and grow, but they’re rich, but they have no cash.
(01:19:44)
Now they’re going to have to go out and borrow a lot of money to pay a tax. They’re going to have to get good appraisers. They’re going to have to get a lot of accountants. The only one going to make money are appraisers and accountants and lawyers. But those people, they’re all going to leave. They’re all going to go to other countries. So if a company succeeds, it must give a lot of its value to the government. And if it doesn’t succeed, the government doesn’t take any risk. They don’t lose, but they do lose really because they lose all those jobs and all of those important things. If the tax queen gets her way, every company in the United States will leave. I mean, they’re going to leave. They’re not staying here. There’s such competition for companies.
(01:20:25)
It’s like a basketball player, a baseball player, a football player. There’s a lot of competition. No different, just bigger numbers. Altogether Kamala’s $4.1 trillion dollar tax hike is projected to reduce GDP by 2%, raise the typical family’s taxes by at least $3,000 a year, lower wages by 1.2% and kill at least a million full-time jobs. Other than that, I think it’s quite a good plan. It’s just crazy. I will not let that happen to our country. I will keep your taxes low and your job numbers high. That’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to have the highest job. We had the highest job numbers in history in my administration. We’re going to make that look like peanuts. The theft of our company’s factories, jobs, and wealth by foreign countries is over. We are not going to allow it to happen anymore. And many of those who left will be coming back and they’re going to be coming back fast.
(01:21:26)
They want to come back. They want to come back. I produced that with the money. We took in, hundreds of billions of dollars came back into our shores once I made that change on the tax law, which had to get approved by Congress, believe it or not. Next to reduce costs for both manufacturers and consumers, I will remove 10 old regulations for every new regulation. Every time we put on a regulation, we cannot put it on unless, and I did that and that’s what gave us, we had it up very high. We had about seven to one it turned out and we had it up high. Now we’re going to bring it up to a newer level, a higher level, and I will start by terminating Kamala’s insane electric vehicle mandate on day one. It’s killing our car industry.
(01:22:15)
Kamala’s EV mandate is killing the US auto industry. It requires that within just a few years, 67% of all new cars and trucks must be electric, and it doesn’t work for trucks at all because of their weight. Their payload. Doesn’t work at all. And because they can’t go far. I was with the truckers recently because they came to see me because they don’t know what to do. They say they want us to go all electric with trucks. And I was with one man who was a giant in the industry, older guy, very smart, just like 29,000 trucks, 29. I said, “What the hell? 29,000.” He said, “Yes, sir. And I’ve been buying trucks for 50 years and every single damn year, those trucks got bigger and better and more efficient and more beautiful. They could carry more payload, they could do, every single year and then we put apartments on those trucks.” He called it an apartment. So the cab where they put these things where they can live. He said, “And those damn apartments now are so beautiful that you’d love to live in one of them.” And he said, “I don’t know.”
(01:23:34)
I’m going to leave Mar-a-Lago and move into the back of a truck. But it’s beautiful. I can think of worse things to be honest with you. It’s sort of cool, right? Travel all over the country. But he said, “They get better.” So then I said, “Well, what’s wrong with the electric?” He said, “If we go from New York to Los Angeles, we have to stop six times and you’ll never find a charger.” But assuming you had chargers, which you won’t have, they built as you know, big story, eight chargers someplace in the Midwest. They spent $9 billion. This is like a gas pump with electricity in it. Right. Boom. They spent $9 billion and three of them don’t work. Now, if you did the whole country at that rate, it would cost you $10 trillion, 10 trillion. But they said, we have to stop six times and they’re long stops, much longer than fill it up like a tank.
(01:24:39)
He said, “With a big load of diesel, we can get all the way and we can even start coming back without a stop. And the truck gets lighter as you go along.” The other thing he said that people don’t know is that an electric truck would be two and a half times heavier because batteries are very, very heavy. And that would mean you’d have to rebuild every bridge in the United States of America because they’re not designed for that kind of a weight. So every bridge in the United States would have to be rebuilt. And also he said a couple of other little problems. He said, “The battery is so big, it would take a lot of our payload. Would lose 40% of our payload. Would have to have battery in there instead.” I said, “So when you tell them this, if you’re a child and somebody said that, you’d say, okay, let’s think about it in 10 years or 20 years from now.”
(01:25:26)
Doesn’t work. He said, “We tell them and they said, we don’t care. You’re going to order all electric truck.” This is like a dictatorship. These people are sick. Now they want to make our army tanks all electric. I save the army tanks up in Ohio where they make them. And because I hated the fact that they were closing it. When I was president-elect, I got called from the great Jim Jordan, congressman from Ohio in Lima. They have a plant that manufactures the army tanks. They were going to close it. And I looked, I went there. The complexity, the talent, the people they had working there was incredible. And I said, “We’re not closing this plant.” And now it’s the number one producer. It’s incredible. But now they want to make army tanks that are electric because they want to go into a country and blast the crap out of it in an environmentally friendly way.
(01:26:21)
No, these people are crazy. And the problem is the electric battery is so big and so heavy that it would have to be in like a wagon that a child pulls behind the tank. They’d pull in a battery, and it would have to be, and it doesn’t work. They want to make everything electric. And yet, think about it. They want to make everything electric, but and I’m a big fan of electric. I think it’s great. There are certain applications. I mean, Elon Musk endorsed me powerfully. Okay. We love him, and his product is incredible. In fact, he’s doing a new product today. It’s got no steering wheel on it. Do you know that he’s out in some place announcing a new product with no steering wheel. I said, “Well, that wouldn’t be for me, but is that really the future?” He knows. I’m giving him full credit.
(01:27:12)
I think he’s incredible. He gave me the most powerful endorsement. He was in Butler with us the other day. You probably saw that and it was great. He said, the whole country. He said, America will never survive if Trump doesn’t get in because he knows the alternative. It’s two people. It’s like the alternative is not acceptable. He’s a strong guy, smart guy, brilliant. But among other things, he does the Tesla and it’s great, but it doesn’t mean that everybody has to have that. And I tell a story about him. I’m very close to him. I have a lot of respect for him. I think he respects me. He gave me the strongest endorsement you could ever get. But he never once came up to me and said, “Could you stop knocking electric cars?” Because I don’t knock them. I think they’re incredible, but it’s for a group of people.
(01:27:56)
I love them. I think they’re great, but it’s for a certain group of people where they might work even better, but not everybody, because some people want to go long distances. They will cost more. You have the fact that they probably are going to be made in China. Remember this? I said, we have more oil and gas, we have more liquid gold under our feet. So why would we do the batteries? Where China has that, we have liquid gold. So we want gasoline-propelled cars. But it’s even worse than that because Kamala also co-sponsored a bill to impose a 100% ban on the sale of all new gas-powered cars and trucks. So she’s going to ban them, which would kill an estimated 200,000 US auto jobs, including almost every job that you have in a place called Michigan. How do you like that idea?
(01:28:53)
She has a ban. She has a ban where not going to allow them to be made. And honestly, for some app, like I’m telling you about the army tanks, I’m telling you about trucks. The battery’s not going to work. It’s not going to work. The electrics are just not going to work. Maybe in 20 years, 30 years, who knows, but it’s not going to work. What it will do is drive our country into a depression. The entire industry would go to China for the making of these all electric cars and trucks. The auto industry would be non-existent or dead. It will be dead. It will never be able to survive. This is one of the major reasons why I’ve been overwhelmingly endorsed by the rank and file membership of the Teamsters, including 62% of the Teamsters members right here in Michigan. They rank and file of the Teamsters nationwide, the firemen, the policemen. The policemen, we have 100% of the policemen. I don’t think there’s one police person and the whole country that endorses lunatic, I don’t believe there’s one policeman in the country.
(01:30:03)
We just got a 400,000 group of police, the Fraternal Order. It’s the biggest group in the country, but we’ve got just about every sheriff’s group, every law enforcement group, is because we’re going to stop crime. She’s not going to stop crime. She wants open borders. She wants people to pour into our country and destroy our country and to move into your little towns and cities and your big towns and cities too, and destroy our country. She wants open borders. They put a little trap out there a couple of months ago. They made it a little bit tougher, but they didn’t stop airplanes from flying in with hundreds of thousands of people coming into our country. They’re destroying our country. We can’t let it happen. The rank and file of the UAW members are also with us too.
(01:30:54)
If you go to the UAW, the autoworkers, they’re for us also. Shawn Fain, who I never met, the head of the United Auto Workers, did a tremendous disservice to the people he represents by allowing the government of the United States to put out an all-electric mandate. Because after I terminate the mandate, my first day in office, I will terminate it on my first day. We will go back to making electric cars, gasoline-propelled cars, hybrids, and anything else that comes along at the time, probably hydrogen, I’ll do without because when they blow up, you are unrecognizable. I don’t like that. The hydrogen car, they keep talking about hydrogen. The problem is when it has a problem, it blows up violently. So the beautiful woman sitting in the fourth row, you’d never recognize her again, and somehow I don’t want to be able to. I’m not going to buy one of those suckers. I don’t care how good, if they say they’re really working quite well now, that’s not going to be good enough.
(01:31:58)
But they talk about hydrogen. Who knows? The EV mandate is also a costly disaster for working families to comply with Kamala’s quotas. Auto makers are forced to jack up the cost of gas-powered vehicles artificially to push consumers toward the very expensive electric alternative. So they’re going to raise the prices on one to subsidize the other. That’s not a good thing. So Kamala gives rich people $7,500 tax breaks to buy luxury electric cars. A lot of people don’t know that yet she makes the working class pay more for a entry-level car that’s powered by gasoline, which we have so much of. And I will reverse this also, this injustice on day one.
(01:32:47)
Kamala’s EV mandate is one of the most demented regulations that’s been conceived. I mean, we have a lot of them, but this is about as bad as it gets. It’ll destroy US auto manufacturing immediately. It’ll destroy our trucking-based supply chain, destroy our electric grid, destroy our military, destroy our roads and bridges with vehicles that are far too heavy. We can’t even use them. Destroy the state of Michigan and it’ll totally destroy our middle class. That’s why I will not only repeal the federal mandate, I will also stop California from imposing any state-level mandate to ban gas-powered cars, and it’s very simple to solve. Vote for Trump and the gasoline engine will be here for a long, long time. They’re going to be here for a long time, and they’ve it to a point where it gives very little pollution, very little. It’s amazing what they’ve been able to do, but it’s what people want. It’s much less expensive. It’s what people want.
(01:33:52)
The next part of our effort to bring back domestic manufacturing will be to restore the power, confidence, and the wealth of the American consumer. We have to let them be wealthy again. We have to let them make money, not give money like they did. That’s also… Energy, what their stupid energy policies caused inflation, but also the fact that they gave so much money away. That was a very bad thing to do. They thought they were going to buy people’s votes. Well, they’ve already spent that money and they paid for it actually more so because of the cost of inflation for them.
(01:34:28)
Over the past four years, Kamala’s inflation catastrophe has cost the typical family $29,000 in price hikes. So inflation has cost them $29,000. New and used car prices are up over 29%. Average interest rates for new cars has doubled and tripled and quadrupled. Meanwhile, repair and maintenance costs are up 32%. Car parts are up 22%. Car insurance premiums. What’s going on with that? Some places it’s up 100% and the cost of gasoline is up 62%. By driving up prices and interest rates, Kamala’s inflation disaster sent car payments way up and car sales way down. Your numbers are terrible by the way.
(01:35:13)
For the first time ever, the all in cost of car ownership is now over $1,000 a month. Never been anywhere near that. More than 20% of the median workers’ wage just to have an average car. This is a catastrophe for the American dream and a dire crisis for American automakers. One of my top priorities will be to quickly defeat inflation and make America affordable again. We will quickly defeat it. We have to bring down prices. I will cut taxes slash regulations, curb wasteful spending, and unleash energy production. It’ll all happen very quickly. This will rapidly drive prices down, lower interest rates, and put more money

Donald Trump (01:36:00):

… into the pockets of American consumers. It’ll also bring you a grocery bill way down. I have more complaints on grocery, the word grocery, and it’s simple word, but it means like everything you eat, the stomach is speaking, it always does. And I have more complaints about that, bacon and things going up, double, triple, quadruple. As part of this effort, I will pass major tax cuts for workers, including no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on social security benefits for our seniors. And here’s what I told you about before. The reason you’re all sticking around because I had to make… I said, “Do they mind a little bit longer speech because it is a big subject.” “No sir. They love it.” And I haven’t noticed anybody leaving. There was one gentleman over there, but he came back. He went to the bathroom. What the fake news will do is take a picture of one empty seat say, “People are fleeing.” No, they don’t flee. Nobody’s fleeing, nobody’s leaving.
(01:37:14)
I always watch. If they start to leave, I just end the speech, “Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen. We’re going to make America great again. Enjoy yourself.” No, I do that. Because oftentimes I lose the teleprompter. Teleprompters go out, but she lost a teleprompter last week. Did you see it? She was talking about 32 days to the election and she goes, “There are 32 days. Oh. Oh my God, I just lost a…” Then she, “32, 32, 32, 32.” And I said, “What the hell happened to her?” And then the teleprompter kicked back on, “32 days to the election.” You don’t want this for your President. I lose the teleprompters probably 5%, 10% of the time. Sometimes I’ll be in front of 50,000 people, I’ll lose a teleprompter. You got to wing it. You know what you got to do? And your can’t say, “I just lost my teleprompter.” Ladies and gentlemen, how about Biden if he loses his teleprompter? He goes… Do you ever see him lose it? Because they do go off, especially outside.
(01:38:28)
The wind is blowing. I had one in Ohio. Bernie Moreno, I think he has a good chance of winning, by the way. And the teleprompter… It was like 45 mile an hour winds and rainy, miserable. And I’m saying, I can’t believe… We had a tremendous crowd. In fact, he went to first place when I made that speech. And it’s going back and forth like this and you couldn’t read it. Do you ever try reading… And then they blew off the stage. I’m stuck up there. I said, “Ladies and gentlemen, we have just lost our teleprompters. I hope you enjoy the rest of the speech.” And we made a speech and all I know is he won. He ended up winning the primaries. That was right before the primaries. But this is what you’ve been waiting for because today I am also announcing that as part of our tax cuts, we will make interest on car loans fully deductible.
(01:39:29)
A lot of you people are in the car industry actually. I met a lot of them backstage. What do you do? I’m in the car industry, but a lot of them, and I told him about it, he’s a very knowledgeable person. Here’s a guy, he’s done it all his life. He’s sitting right over there. I don’t want to embarrass him, but he said, “Where did you come up with that idea? That’s the coolest thing.” It’s like the paperclip again, it’s like the paperclip. Somebody comes up with the paperclip and everybody says, “Why the hell didn’t I think of that?” Somebody came up with the paperclip, I guess, made a lot of money and other people said, gee… But he said, “I’ve been in the car industry all my life. I’ve never thought about that.” We’re going to make it fully deductible, the interest payments, that’s going to revolutionize your industry. This will stimulate massive domestic auto production and make car ownership dramatically more affordable for millions and millions of working American families. This is a phenomenal thing if I do say so myself, who likes that idea? Isn’t that great?
(01:40:42)
Likewise, to help small businesses afford the work vehicles they need to get the job done, we will double the amount of equipment investment they can deduct under section 179. You know what that means? You’re going to get tremendous deduction ability. This will be great for small businesses, great for Ford and General Motors. It’ll be great for them. And we’ll sell cars and trucks and work vans like never before. You’ll sell so much. Oh, those companies are going to like me and I have nothing to do with them. I have nothing to do… See, another guy would’ve gone and seen them yesterday say, “Here’s what I’m going to do.” This is how bad they are. They’re evil. Biden would’ve gone to see him, “Hey, I have an idea.” But he doesn’t have those ideas. Well, Hunter gets a half a million bucks of painting and he can’t paint worth a damn, so that’s worse. That’s much worse. As we protect gas powered cars, we will unleash American energy and bring prices way down fast.
(01:41:45)
The day I take office, the word will go out and we are going to frack, frack, frack and drill, baby drill. And Kamala Harris, she’s been against fossil fuels all her life. She has no idea why. She has no idea, but she’s been against, somebody told her. But Kamala Harris is doing the exact opposite. She’s waging war on American energy and she’s imposed a natural gas export ban that I talked about with you before that’s currently in effect. And she’s right now shutting down power plants all across our country, ruining our country, ruining our electricity pricing, and our grid. She’s destroying our grid. Prices will soar by more than 100%, driving us into third world status, even as she forces us to only buy electric cars.
(01:42:40)
Think of it, we don’t have electricity. In California you have brownouts or blackouts every week. And blackouts, the place is stone-cold broke, no electricity. And this idiot governor over there that I had to deal with that is really… I don’t know if he’s really for real. You have blackouts, brownouts all the time, and now he wants to go 100% electric cars. And then if somebody wants to build some kind of a plant to make electricity, he’ll make it impossible for the… What are they doing? They’re destroying our country. They’re destroying our country. If this continues, all Michigan manufacturing will be dead in absolutely no time. You won’t have any manufacturing because as that industry goes, and as the energy goes, there goes your businesses. As President, my policy will be to maximum… It’s going to be maximum energy production to achieve low prices and make the United States into really a manufacturer… I want to be a manufacturing powerhouse. We’re going to be more powerful than ever before. AI is a new industry and it’s a very big one.
(01:43:54)
And I don’t know, it’s got some interesting difficulties, but China wants it and other countries want it and we’ve got to be there. But in order to be able to compete with China or compete even with anybody with AI, we have to make double the electricity that we have right now. Take all of the electricity we have, we have to double it up just for that one very big industry. It’s going to be very big, but it needs unbelievable amounts of electricity. I will cut the price of energy and electricity in half. Ready? 12 months from January 20th, I take office on January 20th, your electric bill, including cars, air conditioners, heating, everything, your total electric bill will be 50, 50, 50% less. We’re going to cut it in half. And we have it. We have the power to do it because we have it. We don’t need ships, we don’t need long train. We have everything. We’re going to have to build some pipelines because we can’t transport it but that’s easy to do and that’s safer than trains but we’re going to get this done.
(01:45:07)
And you’re going to have within one year, think of it, within one year, you’re going to have electric bills and energy bills and your gasoline for your car is going to be 50, 50% cheaper than it is right now. That’s a big thing. That’s a big thing. But we will seriously expedite our environmental approvals. I will expedite them if I have to. I’ll just approve them and approve them because they use that. They use the environmental approvals to stop progress and quickly double our electricity capacity. And we’re going to have it doubled and tripled. This will drive down inflation and make America and Michigan the best place on earth to build a factory. And finally, as we bring back our economy and our auto industry, and you’re going to see an industry that’s going to come back so fast, they all want to be here, but the laws and the regulations and the tremendous crazy taxes and the competition with other countries made it impossible. I will continue my first term efforts to protect America from the threat of Chinese automobiles.
(01:46:15)
I will stop Chinese and other countries produced automobile and autonomous vehicles. Do you like autonomous? Does anybody like an autonomous vehicle? You know what that is, right? When you see a car driving along. Some people do, I don’t know. It’s a little concerning to me, but the autonomous vehicles, we’re going to stop from operating on American roads. Remember this? I will close the loopholes under Biden and Harris that are beginning to allow Chinese vehicles to creep into American streets. They’re destroying Europe. Europe’s car industry is being just decimated. This is not just a matter of economic security, it’s a matter of national security. We have to have a car industry and that can be swapped in wars, that can be swapped and make other things. There’s so many reasons you have to keep it, the second world war. Do you know we built in the second World War, we built a ship a day? Nobody can even believe it. Today we practically don’t build a ship a year.
(01:47:22)
We used to build, the second world war, we built a ship a day, freighters and things, but a ship a day. And today it’s crazy. We’re going to get it back to a position where we can do things like that. This is how we will bring back our auto parts and bring back our manufacturing and unlock the destiny of the great state of Michigan. Michigan’s going to be your biggest beneficiary for this. We’re going to put America workers first, America’s jobs first, American cars first, America factories first. And we’re going to put the American people first. It’s the first time in a long time you’ve heard that. From commerce to labor, to FEMA, boy oh boy has have they been treated badly, the people of North Carolina and other states, Georgia a little bit. You get some governors that did a great job. But boy, the federal government let you down. I will work for Americans and only for Americans. I want to work for Americans. America first, it’s a very simple policy, American first. When we do all of this, you’ll witness nothing less than the launch of a new American industrial revolution. Thousands of factories will open up all across our land. Great paying blue collar jobs will lift up those who have suffered so terribly over the past four years. You heard the numbers in the auto industry, it’s collapsing. Inflation will come down fast. American cars and products will be exported and admired all throughout the world again. Young people will move from the coast to big cities into the heartlands to build their fortunes on the new frontier of the American Midwest. They’re going to move back. Instead of leaving, they’re going to be moving back. And I’m telling you right now, standing here in the center of this once great city that by the end of my term the entire world will be talking about the Michigan miracle and the stunning rebirth of Detroit. That’s going to happen very quickly. With your vote we will bring back our country, we will rebuild our country, and we will reunite our country with American heart, American grit, and American hands.
(01:49:45)
I want to thank you all for being here. This is a great honor. It’s such an important day to me because I’ve been talking about this subject for so long and I’ve watched politicians destroy this area, this state, this city. And it’s so easy to fix and we’re going to fix it better than anybody ever thought even possible, so God bless you all. And now I think on top of all that, I think I have to answer some questions. Could you believe it? I’ll stay here and I’ll answer some questions, but thank you all very much and we appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Can you believe this?

Speaker 2 (01:50:42):

Well, that was a tremendous amount of information that you’ve given to us, and we’ll see that the questions you’ve really answered most of them already.

Donald Trump (01:50:52):

I think so.

Speaker 2 (01:50:53):

You’ve really done a great job. And so what I thought I would do is to jump to a couple of personal questions. The first one that I’ve always been intrigued with, you have an enormous amount of energy. I haven’t seen anybody like you in my lifetime that keep on going and going and going in spite of sometimes some rather negative responses and forces here in our country. How do you do it?

Donald Trump (01:51:15):

Like a bullet to the ear. I have parents that were great. You have good parents, I believe in that theory it helps. But I did, I have two parents that were energetic. They lived for a long time. They were around for a long time. They were great people. But my father had tremendous energy and my mother did too. And it’s a little bit that I think more than anything else. And I enjoy what I do and I love this. Despite I could be right now in the most beautiful ocean on the sand, exposing my really beautiful body, so beautiful to the sun and the surf. Skin cancer right? To the sun and the surf all over the world. Or I could be in Detroit with you and I’d rather be in Detroit with you.

Speaker 2 (01:52:05):

That’s great. Thanks. We’ve known each other for a while and I know your children and I have been just enormously impressed with their values, their lifestyles, and you did a great job raising them. How did you do that? Everybody here loves their kids. And you mentioned about creating an environment where we can pass our businesses down to our children, basically tax-free or something close to that. What did you do with your children to make them so responsible and so involved in everything that you do?

Donald Trump (01:52:39):

Well, I’m fortunate in that they’re smart children. Many of you have smart and some will have some that aren’t so smart. And you have to understand it happens too, and that’s all. And you’re going to love them just as much. But I have smart children and they’ve been good academically, et cetera, et cetera. But very importantly, I would always tell them, “No drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes, no drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes.” And they’d go out and Ivanka would say, “Dad, stop telling me that.” I said, “I’m going to tell it you every time I see you. I’m going to drive you wild with this. No drugs, no alcohol.” And I would say that, and I hope that because who knows, they don’t have any of those problems. I’ve seen friends, very smart people, they have smart kids, but their kids get hooked on drugs or they get hooked on alcohol.
(01:53:39)
Alcohol is in many ways… They tell me, I don’t know. I never had a glass of alcohol. I had a great brother, a brother who was a wonderful guy, but he had an alcohol problem and he started to do the same. He said, “Don’t ever drink alcohol.” And he smoked. And I put cigarettes in that same category, almost that same category, but they’re certainly not good for you. But I would always tell my kids, because I’ve seen parents that had brilliant children, went to the best schools, they were great, but they got hooked on drugs or alcohol and they never made it. They couldn’t compete basically. They never made it. And many of them are dead. Many of them die. They die with this fentanyl that’s coming in. I’m going to get that problem… I had that problem almost solved with President Xi, by the way. And I said, “You have to impose the maximum penalty or we’re not going to…” I would always talk about trade. We have the power of trade. And I said, “Well, we’re just not going to get along on trade.”
(01:54:40)
Hence, I could do things like we talked about. I don’t want to go into it, but we can do things. And he and I had a handshake on he was going to impose the maximum penalty on people that run companies that sell us through Mexico. Almost all of it comes through Mexico and the maximum penalty is the death penalty. And he was going to impose that. And then we had the transfer of power and this guy came in and he didn’t know what to do with anything. And so that went down the tubes. But one of the first things I’m going to do is talk to him about that because they were going to give the death penalty to anybody sending fentanyl into this country. And that would’ve really solved a lot of the problem. And the other thing I say, and it’s not nice to say, I don’t like saying it, but I’ve seen a lot of countries, I deal with all of them and I know all of them, and the only ones that don’t have a drug problem are the ones that have the death penalty.
(01:55:34)
We can set up all of our blue ribbon committees. Everybody calls me. You would call me, my friends call me, “Could I be on that blue ribbon committee?” And then have a blue ribbon committee on drugs and how to stop these drug lords who are very smart people, very vicious, very smart. And we’ll have these people from New York, some dilettantes, and they didn’t want to talk about it. They just want to be a part of whatever it is. The only ones that stop drugs, the only ones are the ones that have the death penalty. And you have to remember, it sounds horrible, but what’s more horrible is what they do to our country. Because on average, he or she, male or female, drug dealer will kill 500 people. And that doesn’t include the families that are devastated. I know families that lost a son or lost a daughter, they’ve never been the same, they’re like different people. You talk to them and they just… Years later, I say, “Has it gotten better?” “No, it’s gotten worse,” they tell me.
(01:56:36)
And there’s nothing worse than that and nothing worse than that. And it’s because of drugs. Maybe it’s too much for the people to go with. But I will say this, the only countries that solve their drug problem, China, I went to President Xi, I said, so… First time I met him, I said, “Do you have a drug problem?” “No, no, no, no, no.” 1.4 billion people. “And why don’t you have a drug problem?” He says, “Death penalty, quick trial.” What’s a quick trial? The dealer is immediately put on trial. They don’t have nine years of legal and then another nine years of appeals, 22 years later and then they’re released. No, no, they don’t play games and it’s a tough deal. But he said, “Quick trial.” I said, “What is quick trial?” Immediate trial? And you know what the drug dealers do? They say, “Hey, let’s get the hell out of here fast.” They don’t play games. They don’t play games. They even send the bullet to the family and they make them pay for the bullet. They make them pay for the bullet.
(01:57:51)
It’s vicious. But they have no drug problem with 1.4… They had a drug problem for centuries with the poppy fields, with all the things, but countries were taking them over that were much smaller. They were being decimated because everybody was… They had a tremendous drug problem. But it stopped years ago and it was a death penalty. And I can tell you, we could set up all the committees, blue ribbon and every… Headed by so-and-so a society person from Madison Avenue. But I will tell you that it’s a waste of time. The only thing that’s going to stop… And we got it down. I got it down 19%, that’s great. But it’s not like… I got it done. And we worked like hell. We had so much security in the border. We had the German Shepherds. There’s a certain dog, a certain type of German Shepherd, so they have millions of dollars worth of machinery. And they have a dog. And it’s a certain German Shepherd. Some of you know what it is. It has a sense of smell that’s so incredible that the machine is nothing by comparison, nothing.
(01:59:02)
And it’s incredible to see, incredible. But we watched it very closely on the border. We had a lot of dogs that did this incredibly well and had a lot of very expensive machinery that did it good, it’s not great, but they did it good. Not nearly as good, believe it or not. And we had it down about 19%. And that was it. It was very tough. With a death penalty you would get rid of, you would eradicate drugs in this country. And I talk about it a lot. I say that because maybe people have to get used to it because it sounds harsh, but when you think of it, if they do kill on average 500 people… Everybody in this room knows a lot of people that they lost a child or sometimes a father or mother, but they’ve lost a child to fentanyl. And that wouldn’t have happened if we had the death penalty. But the country’s going to have to tell us that they’re ready for it because it’s a pretty big step.

Speaker 2 (01:59:59):

You mentioned the Abraham Accords and Israel. This community is one of the largest Arab communities in the United States here, Dearborn, Michigan. And we have a thriving and very, very large Jewish community. Upon your inauguration, what will you do to accelerate the Abraham Accords and peace in the Middle East? What can we possibly do at this point in time to change the direction right now and move forward?

Donald Trump (02:00:30):

It’s got to change. It’s got to change fast. Also, the Abraham Accords, when we did that, nobody believed it. We had four very important countries early on, and we would’ve had all of them in. I even make the statement, I said it the other day. I even think we would’ve had Iran in if you can believe it. I really believe that because they were ready to make a deal. Biden lost an unbelievable opportunity, and now they’re very rich. And I don’t know, they view it perhaps differently, but I wouldn’t necessarily say they’re doing so good either. But I will tell you this, we have to have peace throughout the world. And if we don’t have peace throughout the world, we’re not smart people because it doesn’t make sense. I’ve stopped a lot of wars from starting. I was very proud of that. People don’t know, but there are countries that were going to war, and I stopped them using trade to stop them. I used trade. I threaten trade. I’d say, you’re not going to do business with the United States if you do.
(02:01:28)
There’s countries that have been fighting for centuries essentially and stop. And then they go and kill a lot of people, crazy but I’ve stopped a lot of people. But the Abraham Accords were very important. And you had really peace. You had the Arabs and the Jews getting along, and those are for the four countries. Now, it should have been many countries right now, it’s still the same four. Think of it, when I left, we were going to sign people as fast as you can think, and they could have done the same thing, but they didn’t have the talent. They didn’t have the administration to do it. And they even agreed it was a good thing. It was a good thing. It was actually a great thing. If I were named Obama, I would’ve had the Nobel Prize given to me in 10 seconds. He got the Nobel Prize, he didn’t even know what the hell he got it for. Remember he got elected.
(02:02:20)
Well, so did I. He got elected and they announced he was getting the Nobel Prize. Remember? He said, “Oh, what did I do?” He didn’t know what the hell he did. He got the Nobel Prize for doing nothing, for getting elected, but I got elected too. Think of that, we did something, the Abraham Accords unprecedented. Nobody thought it was possible. And I’m not saying I want or not, I’m just saying if it was anybody else, Liberal, Democrat, they would’ve had it before the damn thing was even signed. There has to be fairness and I don’t care about… I’m not looking for it. I’m not politicking for it. I’m just saying that there’s a lot of unfairness in this world, and I think when you do things, you should really be… You can have peace in the Middle East. You can get along. This was a start. This would’ve been so important if you could have had almost all of the countries and maybe even Iran. Iran would be the outlier, but maybe even Iran.
(02:03:24)
At a certain point, I really believe I could have gotten them all, including Iran. Everybody would’ve been happy. You would’ve had peace in the Middle East and you would’ve had the Arabs getting along with the Jews and the Jews getting along with everyone else. It would’ve been so beautiful, and they wasted this great opportunity. It’s so sad.

Speaker 2 (02:03:45):

We have time for one final question, and it’s a DEC tradition. We have many young adults and students in the audience today. And so I want to end with this final question. What advice to your 25- year-old self would you give to the young people today, and especially the ones in this audience?

Donald Trump (02:04:06):

I’ve met some people backstage who are young and some really beautiful people, great people, smart as can be from colleges and schools. And I think what I’d do is I’d listen to the speech I made and I’d say maybe… Because they really would like to stay here. They grew up here. And I’d follow, and I will say this, if I implement and I will be able to do it, I will. If we win the election, I would stay right here and I would follow the gravy train because you’re going to have such a great opportunity right in the area that you want to be. You want to be here because your grandparents are here and your parents are here, and people they don’t want to leave. They’ve been forced to leave this area because of politicians that didn’t know what they were doing. I would say stay tuned for a little while.
(02:04:51)
Let’s see what happens on the election. This area will be thriving, like probably almost no area in the country. I think this area will be one of the hottest areas in the country. And I think you can stay here, you’ll get a great job because we’re going to have a lot of opportunities right here in Michigan. And you want to stay here because of your parents. Lot of them really, they told me backstage, “I’d love to stay here, but there’s no real jobs here.” And when you look at those horrible statistics with the auto workers and with what’s happening to the industry, you understand it. But if we win, I would stay here and you watch what’s going to happen, you’ll be happy. You’ll be happier here and I think more successful here than any other place in the country. You will have the American dream. We have to bring back the American dream. You don’t even hear that statement anymore. And we have to have the American dream for our young people and have it right here in Michigan.

Speaker 2 (02:05:44):

Mr. President, thank you. I’m looking forward to all those auto plants that I’m going to be building back here in Michigan in the Midwest.

Donald Trump (02:05:51):

I knew you were going to say that.

Speaker 2 (02:05:53):

It’s okay. They all know anyways. Every time you’re on TV or on the radio, somebody calls me up and said, “Oh, the President was talking about you again.” Thank you so much. And that’s the end of our program today. Thank you all for coming. Let’s give the President a standing ovation.

Donald Trump (02:06:07):

That’s great.

Speaker 2 (02:06:07):

Thank you very much.

Donald Trump (02:06:07):

I don’t want to get them involved.

Speaker 2 (02:06:07):

No, no, no. They all know.

Donald Trump (02:06:07):

You should be proud of it.

Well, thank you very much. This is a rather nice crowd. You can’t see the end of it. Hello, back there. Boy, you are so far. I don’t know if they can see anything. I want to give a special hello to Coachella. We have had a great reception here. And look at this crowd. This is, like, record stuff. As far as the eye can see. That means we’re going to do very well. This is like a poll and a very, also, special hello to the state of California. We got to make it better. We got to make it better.

I stand before you today in the heart of the majestic Coachella Valley to declare that the Republican Party will always put America first and lead us on to victories like you have never seen before. We got a big victory because we become the party of common sense. We call it common sense. We’re conservative. Who the hell knows? We might even be a little bit liberal. But you know what? We have common sense. We have common sense. That’s what it’s all about.
(01:24)
No, no. We’re nice and conservative, but we do it the proper way and we’re doing numbers that nobody’s ever seen. Look at these rallies. Nobody’s ever seen a thing like that. Nobody’s ever seen. And we’re fighting for hardworking citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed, right?

And that sun is hot. I’ll tell you. Should I or should I not put on the hat, the famous hat? Okay, who wants me to put it on? Who loves my hair and said you shouldn’t put it on. All right, I’m putting this sucker … That sun is hot, right? Tell me if it’s nice and neat. Got it? Yeah. Okay? Mr. Wall. I love Mr. Wall, Front Row Joes over here. Here they come.
(02:28)
And we have the great women from North Carolina over here. Look at them. That’s number 219 or something for them. They’re wealthy and beautiful and they have wonderful husbands, I think. I don’t know. What are they doing? What are the husbands doing? The radical left Democrats have destroyed this state, but we are going to save it and we’re going to make it better than ever before. Yet, I’ve come here today not only to talk about California where you have one of the worst governors in the country, Gavin Newsom. Gavin New-scum. No, but you definitely had somebody here that was horrible, Kamala. Kamala. And now she wants to destroy our country. We’re not going to let her destroy our country like she did San Francisco, right?
(03:23)
But how will we save America from suffering the same fate? Because if she’s here, you know how we’ll do it? By voting for Trump. It’s very easy. Kamala Harris and the radical Democrats have destroyed this state. California’s, really it’s a paradise lost, but we’re going to bring it back. Don’t worry about it. We’re bringing it back. It’ll happen fast. We’ll stop the murderers from coming in. The drug dealers, everybody coming into California, coming into our country. Through generations of American history, California stood as the beacon of what our country aspired to become. It really did. It had everything. It had the weather, it had the water. The state had the best schools, the safest communities, and a booming middle class. But all that was eradicated by decades of the very policies that Kamala Harris wants to now force upon America. I don’t think it’s going to happen. And by the way, we’re leading in all the polls, but we have to win. Too big to rig.
(04:28)
We’re leading in the polls, but we have to do it too big to rig because they are good at one thing. You know what that one thing is?

Audience (04:35):

Cheating.

President Donald J. Trump (04:37):

He goes, “Cheating.” They’re professional thieves. Today, California has the highest inflation, the highest taxes, the highest gas prices, the highest cost of living, the most regulations, the most expensive utilities, the most homelessness, the most crime, the most decay, and the most illegal aliens. Other than that, I think you’re doing quite well actually. Turn it up. We’re not going to let Kamala Harris do to America what she did to California. We’re not going to let it happen. So whether you are Democrat, Republican, or independent, this election is your chance to send a message.

Audience (05:24):

[inaudible 00:05:28].

President Donald J. Trump (05:46):

Back home to mommy. She goes back home to mommy. “Was that you, darling?” And then she gets the hell knocked out of her. Her mother’s a big fan of ours. You know that, right? Her father, her mother. No, you always have that.
(06:01)
Now tomorrow, here’s the only problem. So we have, like, a hundred thousand. We have a lot of people. In Butler last week we had 101,000. Can you imagine? Celebrating the life of a great person, a great fireman actually, Corey. We had 101,000. So whether you’re a Democrat or Republican or independent, this election is your chance to send a message to the world that the people of California are not going to take it any longer. We’re not going to take it.
(06:36)
Kamala Harris got you into this mess and only Trump is going to get you out of it. We’re going to get you out of it. But by far, one of the biggest factors in destroying California has been mass illegal immigration and a governor that plays right into their hands. What a shame. What a shame. She got it started, Kamala got it started. Now she’s saying, “No, no. I’d like to see the wall get built.” Oh, she’d like to see … Where was she four years ago? This is new. Her poll numbers are tanking. So all of a sudden she’s in love with the wall, which does work.
(07:13)
Two things work. You know what they are? Wheels and walls. Everything else … You can have a brand new, beautiful computer for that beautiful young boy of yours. And in about two weeks it’s obsolete, but wheels and walls never get obsolete. And we built one hell of a wall. We were going to add 200 miles more. And then we … Bad things happened last time. We got more votes the second time by millions than we got the first. Anyway, they took over and that’s when I realized they want to have an open border because they didn’t want to put a little bit of extra that I bought, far beyond what I said I was going to build. And they sold it for five cents on the dollar. Can you believe it? These people are so bad. And now they’re realizing it works and now they want to build some, but it’s a little late for them because they’re not going to be there very much longer, I don’t think.
(08:11)
Joe Biden was the worst president in the history of our country. She’s the worst vice president in the history of our country. There’s never been anything and we’re not going to let her … I beat Biden. So we have a debate. He went down. He was down. In all fairness to him, he got 14 million votes. She got none, right? So he goes down. They said, “We want you out of here.” “I won’t do it.” “We want you out of here, Joe.” It was a coup. It was a coup. They actually threw him out of office, and I’m convinced that he likes me a little bit more, this much more than he likes her. I’m convinced. I’m pretty well convinced. Across the state, which Kamala or as she would say, Kamala, helped to make a sanctuary state. Does anybody really want …
(09:02)
You know what a sanctuary state is? That’s a place where you keep criminals, right? Who the hell wants that? The mass migration invasion has crushed wages, crashed school systems. Your systems are a disaster. Wrecked the standard of living and brought crime, drugs, misery, and death. Now, over the past four years, border czar Harris has delivered the same nightmare invasion to every state in America as your vice president. I can’t even believe it. How do you like the vice president she picked? How about that guy? How about that guy?

Audience (09:37):

[inaudible 00:09:38].

President Donald J. Trump (09:37):

I don’t know. What the hell is wrong with our country, right? Look, we used to have the greatest … Abraham Lincoln, George, right? Now look at this stuff. Can you believe what we’re doing? She’s so bad. She’s so bad. It can’t happen. Although the way things go in this country nowadays, I guess it probably could. That’s why we want to build up a lead. We got to build up that lead because such bad things. And we’ve got to do it. And I don’t want to keep saying it. Too big to rig. I don’t want to say it. She’s imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons of the third world. They come from the dungeons of the third world. Many, many are prisoners, many are … some had death sentences. They were going to be executed for murder, but they’re now living happily in California and other places in our country.
(10:52)
Congratulations. If you see them, I think you should be kind and take them in. Give them a meal. Let them stay with your children. They’ll take care of your children. From prisons and jails they came, from insane asylums and mental institutions from all over the world, from Venezuela to the Congo. They came … a lot come from the Congo. I don’t know what’s happening in the Congo. We can almost tell the worst areas because if there’s a run on the Congo, we know Congo’s not doing well, but they come from all over the world. She’s resettled them into your communities. Congratulations. And they can now prey on innocent Americans for a while. If Kamala gets four more years, the entire country will become like the migrant camp of LA and San Francisco. What the hell is happening to our cities?
(11:48)
Look, it’s Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln, stand up. Whoa! Honest Abe. Thank you, Honest Abe. We have them all. We got them. I have no idea who he is, but he looks pretty damn good, I’ll tell you. When I win on November 5th, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins. Begins. I had a big debate with a lot of very smart people, political people, and they’re all saying the economy is the most important thing. And when you add inflation, I don’t know, maybe it is. Inflation, I put it as part of the economy, but they say the economy and then inflation, and they had the border down as the third. And I disagree. I think, frankly, I don’t even want to speak against myself. I think the border is number one because we can fix things we can do. But what they’ve done to our country at the border is unbelievable by allowing 21 million people into our country, it’s not sustainable. 645,000 are criminals and some are … 214,000 are what they call high grade A criminals. We have them. Think of that.
(13:09)
One of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gangs that Kamala has imported into our country is the savage Venezuelan prison gang. Isn’t that nice? They formed their little friendship in prison, one of the meanest prisons you’ve ever seen. The Tren de Aragua. Have you heard of it? This is Tren de Aragua gang. Nice individuals, very nice. They’re in Aurora, Colorado where you have a very weak and pathetic governor who’s petrified of them. He’s afraid of the criminals. He’s the governor. You can’t be afraid. But they’re in Colorado and communities all over nationwide. This gang is terrorizing law-abiding citizens, including taking over the multiple apartment complexes. But in Aurora, they’re like me. They’re in the real estate business. They want to go in. The only difference, I use financing. They use guns. Take a look.

Speaker 1 (14:05):

Open borders, deadly consequences.

Speaker 2 (14:07):

Border crisis. Record high crossings are putting a strain on cities across America.

Speaker 3 (14:13):

It is a full-blown invasion.

Speaker 4 (14:15):

Our …

Speaker 5 (14:23):

… program to bring them in under humanitarian parole.

Vice President Kamala Harris (14:26):

I am in favor of saying that we’re not going to treat people who are undocumented across the border as criminals.

Speaker 6 (14:31):

More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder have been released into the United States.

Tammy Nobles (14:38):

My twenty-year-old daughter, Kayla Hamilton, was murdered in her own room. Kayla’s murderer was apprehended by border patrol crossing illegally into the US.

Speaker 7 (14:47):

Kayla’s murderer had been improperly released into the United States.

Speaker 8 (14:50):

Abolish ICE.

Vice President Kamala Harris (14:52):

Yeah, we need to probably think about starting from scratch.

Speaker 9 (14:54):

An Afghan national is in custody today after being accused of plotting an election day terrorist attack. The suspect entered the US on a special immigrant visa.

Speaker 10 (15:02):

More than a dozen people suspected of being Tren de Aragua gang members right here in San Antonio.

Speaker 11 (15:07):

The gang members had been terrorizing the apartment complex.

Speaker 12 (15:10):

New details in the murder of Laken Riley.

Speaker 13 (15:12):

The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuelan national.

Speaker 14 (15:18):

And was paroled and released into the country by the Biden administration.

Speaker 15 (15:21):

Two men, investigators say, are in the country illegally from Venezuela are charged with capital murder in the death of Jocelyn Nungaray.

Speaker 16 (15:28):

Court documents suggest a group of men arrested for beating and robbing a Dallas woman last month are members of a Venezuelan street gang.

Speaker 17 (15:35):

Manuel Hernandez-Hernandez was booked by Colleyville Police just two days earlier and released the day before the robbery.

President Donald J. Trump (15:51):

So crime rates all over the world are down. You know why? Every country, every single. Last week, the great Tom Homan … Do you know Tom Homan? He told me last week, 168 different countries were represented that violated the border list, countries that you never even heard of. Some countries you’ve never even heard of them and some of the most vicious criminals. And Kamala said a few weeks ago that the people that we take in are much nicer than our criminals. No. They make our criminals like the nicest people you’ve ever met. The only good thing is they do, our criminals are considered extremely nice by comparison to the people that we see. They’ll cut your throat and the next morning they won’t even remember. This is what they do. These are really bad. These are really evil people. And they also have terrorists coming in and they have the drug lords coming in and they say, if you ever come back, we’re going to kill you.
(16:49)
So we’re stuck with them, but we’re not stuck with them. They’re going back. They’re going back very soon, very quick. They’re going back and they’re going back fast. And if the countries don’t want to take them back, I just say very simply, that’s okay. We’re going to tariff every damn product you sell into the US. And they’re going to say like they always have to be. “Sir, we would love to take MS-13 gang members back. We think they’re wonderful people.”
(17:16)
We had that problem. When I first came in, you had Honduras and you had, I’d say, three or four different countries, a little bit Mexico. But you had these countries and they wouldn’t take their people back. And I said to one of the generals, I want to get MS-13 the hell out of our country. I really don’t want to put them in our jail, but I don’t want to come back because it’s so expensive.
(17:36)
So we put them in and I said, “General, I want them back.” “Sir, they won’t take them back.” “What are you talking about?” “They won’t take them back, sir.” “How much money do we pay that little group of countries?” “Sir, we give them exactly 750 million a year for economic development.” You know whose development is? For the president of the country. That’s whose development, for his house. So let me ask you. So we give them that. Tell them they’re in violation of our agreement. Tell them we are sending them back. And if you don’t take him, in fact, don’t even say that. Just say, we’re not sending him any more money.
(18:10)
They called up. They called up following morning, all three. There was three countries in this case, all three separate. They called up, said the same thing. “Sir, there seems to be a misunderstanding.” I said, “No.” Obama couldn’t get him back. Nobody could get him back. Bush couldn’t get him back. Nobody could get him back. I got him back. It took me about one phone call.
(18:34)
So we said, “No, there’s no misunderstanding. You send them over in caravans and you don’t take them back. You’re going to take them back and we’re not giving you any more money. It’s over. Your 750 million a year. It’s over.” “Sir, we would be honored to take them back. This was a misunderstanding. It would be our great honor to take MS-13 vicious gang members back. We love them very much.” And they took them back. It was, like, no problem. They used to put airplanes on the runway so we’d have an airplane go up and he couldn’t land and come back. That was with Barack Hussein Obama. Have you heard of him? And we got them all back. We took him out.
(19:18)
You know who took him out? ICE. And you know what she wants to do with ICE? She wants to get rid of ICE. I know some guys in the front couple of rows and they’re very tough, but they don’t want to be in ICE. They don’t want to be … They’re not that tough. But we are known all throughout the world now as an occupied country. We’re like an occupied country. We got people taking over parts of Colorado. We have people taking over other states. A lot of states don’t want to talk about it because they’re embarrassed. The governor’s embarrassed. The mayors are embarrassed. But it’s no different really than if we lost a war. But to everyone here in California and all across our nation, I make this pledge to you. November 5th, 2024 will be liberation day

President Donald J. Trump (20:00):

… in America, liberation day. Liberation day, we’re going to be liberated. Did you ever think you’d hear that 10 years ago, 15 years ago, we’re going to liberate our country from criminals? How stupid are we? How stupid are these leaders. They’re stupid people. I will rescue California and every town across America that’s been invaded and conquered, and we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail or kick them the hell out of the country, which is number one. In May, an illegal alien was arrested in Los Angeles, you know about this, and charged with statistically raping two women in the back of a windowless van that police said was disgustingly outfitted as “a rape dungeon on wheels.” Raped them, raped many people. Detectives believed this, sponsored many more victims whom he drove around late night looking for women, and a remote mountain canyon was involved and the whole thing. And no cell service, no anything. Everything. Everybody was very sophisticated. In other words, viciously tortured. The women were really, really badly hurt.
(21:20)
One woman said, “He didn’t want to rape me. He wanted to kill me.” But they got him, and now we have to put him away for a long time. That’s the thing. I don’t know Gascón, but I hear he is down in the polls, and that’s a very good thing. That’s a very good thing. Likewise, the savage animal who raped and murdered Rachel Moran. You know Rachel Moran? Beautiful woman, 37 years old, Maryland, mother of five. Also broke into a home in Los Angeles just before that after crossing the border illegally. We had the strongest border in the history of our country. Now we have the worst border in the history of the world.
(22:02)
Illegally came in and horrifically assaulted a local nine-year-old girl and her mother, beat him up badly, very badly. One is maybe not even going to make it. In July, an illegal alien who was previously deported three times was arrested in Central Valley for sneaking up to a mobile home early in the morning and setting it on fire while a 32-year-old woman and her seven-year-old daughter and son of 10 years old were inside, all of whom were killed in the most excruciating death. The people watched it happen. There was nothing they could do about it. My message to the American people is very simple. No person who has inflicted the violence and terror that border czar Harris, has unleashed on our country, can ever be allowed to become the president of the United States again. You can’t let this happen.
(22:57)
And anyone who would import gangs to occupy America, we’re not going to be occupied by anybody, cannot ask to be president of this country. Anyone who orchestrated an invasion of America cannot lead America. Kamala Harris, her reign of terror ends. The day I take office, she’s finished. She’s finished. And to expedite removals of Tren de Aragua and other savage gangs. There are many savage gangs. MS-13 is probably even meaner. They don’t like using guns. They like using knives. They cut up two young girls, beautiful young girls walk into school in Long Island. They like Long Island for some reason, a lot of them, but ICE got them out, largely got them out. But two beautiful young girls walk into school, and they cut them up with knives. They cut them up into little pieces. Both of them died. They didn’t want to use a gun because the gun’s not painful enough. These are animals. I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil.
(24:23)
And we will call it Operation Aurora. That’s what we’re going to in honor of the people that have suffered in Aurora at the hands of this horrible gang, Operation Aurora. And if they come back into our country after… We are going to throw them out so far you wouldn’t believe it. But if they come back into our country, it’s an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole, 10 years. And if that doesn’t work, it’ll be 20 years. And if that doesn’t work, I guess it’s going to be the death penalty, right? Death penalty. And I’m hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or law enforcement officer. Death penalty. It’s time. Kamala’s mass migrants, she started this by letting people come in, no proof, no anything. They didn’t need anything. There was no vetting. Just come on in. Where were you? Who are you? Don’t worry. It doesn’t matter. Murders were coming. And remember CNN, they had this young reporter young, beautiful, young reporter talking to somebody. “Where do you come from?” “I come from Colombia.” “Oh, were you in jail?” ” Yes, I was in prison.” “What did you do?” “Murder.” That was the end of CNN for the night. They were not happy with… When that happened, the cameras sort of shut off, immediately shut off. Now, these people… Because look at… Oh wow, look at all that press. Look at all the fake news. That’s a lot of fake news, man. That is a lot of fake news. We need borders, great borders. We had one, but we’re going to have it again very quickly. 2016, I fixed it so fast and so good. The difference was… This is 25 times worse. This is crazy. And in 2016, I said it’s going to be the most important election we’ve ever had, and they meant it, but nobody knew they could do a thing like they’ve done. We gave them a border that was perfect. It was great, great numbers, great everything. All they had to do is leave it alone. He could have gone to the beach. Somebody told him he looks good in a bathing suit. He has one great thing though. He has got an ability that I don’t have. He can put down one of those 16 ounce little things. They’re made out of light aluminum. They’re meant for old people and children to lift. He can’t lift it, so a child is always with him. And he sleeps. The guy can fall asleep instantly with the press watching.
(27:39)
Who the hell wants to sleep with these people watching? And he’s out cold. You see the dribble coming down the side of his cheek. What do you think President Xi of China… He’s a fierce person. I know him very well. He’s a fierce man. What do you think he thinks? He’s thinking, oh, this is great. But he’s actually better than Kamala because, believe it or not, he’s actually a more intelligent person. Can you believe it? Did you ever think I’d be saying that Biden is more intelligent than someone? Kamala’s mass migrant invasion is also placing crippling burdens on local communities and stealing jobs, resources, and opportunity from African-American and Hispanic-American citizens. These people coming in are taking the jobs of African Americans that have had it a long time. Their unemployment rate is through the roof. Wait til you hear the numbers. And also Hispanic American at a little bit less clip.
(28:39)
They’re replacing people that have been in these jobs for a long time, doing a good job, not bothering anybody. They’re living out their lives and they’re being fired. And people that come in… And we don’t even know who the people are. They have no way of knowing. A few years ago, one study found that one in four students in LA County schools was from an illegal immigrant-headed household. And after four years of Kamala Harris, the number is now a much higher number than that. Think of that. They come in by the thousands a day, thousands and thousands all over the country. And you’ve heard the expression, every state is now a border state. They fly them over. That’s the one thing nobody knew.
(29:23)
It even took me a little while to figure out one out. We wondered, what were all those airplanes doing flying into our country? That’s how we found them. We had like hundreds of planes flying over the border. They say, “We’re going to make the border tougher.” How about she said, “Oh, we had a good border bill, but Trump talked Congress out of it.” I didn’t talk anybody out. The bill was defective. It was terrible. Millions of people would’ve come in and would’ve been made citizens, but that’s not the point. The point is they slowed it down so the numbers looked a little bit better, not much. But what they didn’t do is stop airplanes from pouring in with thousands of people. Hundreds of thousands of people a year are flown into the middle of our country. In other words, they’re sick, and that’s what they want.
(30:07)
That’s their policy. They were trying to convince us, yes… All of a sudden she said, “Yes, we can do…” For three and a half years. Think of this. She was saying the other day, “Yes. Oh yes, we want to have a border.” The first time she ever said it. She almost threw up when she said it. But the numbers were looking very bad for her, the poll numbers. She was getting trounced. She was getting trounced. And then all of a sudden, she said, “No, no. We’d like to have a wall. We’d love to have a wall.” Remember me? I said wall. And Mexico did pay for it. They gave us thousands and thousands of soldiers. They paid more. Remember, there was no vehicle for that. I just want to set the record straight because I do everything.
(30:49)
We got thousands of Mexicans patrolling our border, free, free of charge. I said to the head of Mexico, the president, a very good guy, very… He’s a socialist, but these are minor details. I said to him, “President, you have to give us 28,000 soldiers to patrol our border.” “Oh, Donald, Donald, I will not do that. Of course I won’t.” “No, you will do that. I promise you, you will.” “No, no, no, I will not.” “Yes you will.” He goes, “No way.” And I said, “Way.”
(31:20)
And then I said… He a good guy. He’s a friend of mine. He just left the office. He’s good, good guy. But why would he do that? He would do that only if we had leverage. And we do have leverage because we’re the part of gold. We won’t be the part of gold for long if we have idiots, like we’re talking about coming in and running things. We won’t be a part of gold for long, let me tell you. But he said to me, “No, we won’t do that.” I said, “So,” I said, “here’s what you do. I don’t want to be talking to you. You’re my friend. I don’t want to embarrass you with a negotiation. Have your negotiator, please, your top guy come and see me.” So they came in. What is… That’s nice. That’s nice. Thank you. Thank you. What a friendly group this is. I thought there was a little riot over there. Thank you. That’s very-

Speaker 18 (32:38):

USA. USA. USA. USA.

President Donald J. Trump (32:38):

Thank you.

Speaker 18 (32:38):

USA. USA.

President Donald J. Trump (32:38):

Thank you everybody.

Speaker 18 (32:38):

USA. USA.

President Donald J. Trump (32:41):

Thank you very much, everybody. That’s very nice. Thank you over there. I can’t even see them. They’re so far away. Thank you very much. They probably can’t hear us, so they might as well get into the [inaudible 00:32:51] because it is far away. This place is… This is crowded. But just to finish the story. So I said… The guy comes in wearing the most beautiful suit I’ve ever seen. In fact, I wanted to say, “Who’s your tailor?” But it wouldn’t be a good negotiation. Guy walks in to talk about soldiers on the border. I said, “Who’s your tailor?” It just didn’t work. So he walks in, handsome guy, beautifully tailored, and I said, “No, we want you to give us 28,000 soldiers for our border free of charge.”
(33:17)
And he laughs at me. He sort of laughed. The State Department woman, very good. 25 years, she’s worked on Mexico, she said, “Sure, they’ll never do that.” I said, “Yes, they will, 100%.” He said no. I said yes. He said no. I said yes. Then I said, “Here’s what I’m doing. I’m signing an order. Every fricking car that you sell into the United States is going to have a 50% tariff and every piece of merchandise you sell into the United States, starting on Monday morning,” this was a Friday evening, “will have a tariff of 25 to 50% and we’ll make a tremendous profit over and above the cost to you.” He said, “May I have a minute, sir, and call somebody.” I said, “You’re going to call the president, right?” “Yes, I am.” Came back. I said, “Do me a favor. I’m very late. They’re trying to impeach me, and I have to work on that a little bit.”
(34:04)
These sleazebags. I’ve been under investigation more than Alphonse Capone. Think of it. And they considered me to be a great president. Nobody did what I did, nobody. So what happens is this. So he comes back two minutes later, “Sir, I’d like to report that it would be our honor to give you thousands of soldiers, sir. We would love to give them to you free of charge, sir.” I said, “Thank you very much. Thank you very much.” So we gave… Mexico was a big contributor. I just wanted to set the record straight. Remember when I said if they don’t give, we’re going to build the wall 10 feet higher. I was going to do that too. The massive costs of illegal immigration are now being experienced by communities all across the country and are destroying your children’s education, their safety, and indeed their lives. Your children are in danger. They can’t go to school with these people.
(34:58)
These people are from a different planet. Kamala is turning us into a third world nation. That’s what happened in San Francisco. When she was the DA of San Francisco, the things she did. She started that whole decline with our victory. Jesus, Willy-Brow. Who said that? Who’s that guy? What? Stand up. This can only happen in California. Yes. Yeah. I didn’t say it. Remember that. He said it. He said it. He said it. You remember when a man… We’re talking about this guy, Chris Christie. He went off the reservation, right? We have some people… And some guy shouts out to me, “He’s a fat pig, sir.” Nobody heard it but me, but it was still… He said it. “Sir, you should not call Chris Christie a fat pig, please. He’s not a fat pig. You shouldn’t. You’re very rude, sir. We’re going to have to throw you out if you do it again. He is not a fat pig.”
(36:35)
And you know what? The press, they said, “That’s son of a gun” They couldn’t even report this because I was defending, because you’re not allowed to use the word fat. You can use any word you can. You cannot call somebody fat. That’s not allowed anymore. You lose your job. You lose your life. With our victory, we are going to become, and quickly, the greatest, strongest, freest, safest, and most powerful nation the world has ever seen. And on day one, I will close the border, and I will stop the invasion of illegal criminals coming into our country. And despite all of the damage that she has done to this state and to our nation in the past four years… She’s the worst. Oh, she’s terrible. She’s terrible. Thank goodness she doesn’t have much energy, because if she did, she had real energy, she’d really be bad. Kamala Harris said this week, she can’t think of one thing, not one thing that she would do differently. Take a look. I’ll show you a few.

Speaker 19 (37:41):

Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?

Speaker 20 (37:47):

There is not a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 21 (37:49):

I stood there on the tarmac watching you check your watch.

Speaker 22 (37:52):

The chaotic and deadly us evacuation from Afghanistan stunned Americans and the world and cost the lives of 13 US soldiers.

Speaker 19 (38:00):

Would you have done something differently?

Speaker 20 (38:02):

There is not a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 23 (38:04):

More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder have been caught at the border, and then released into the United States.

Speaker 9 (38:11):

The Afghan National is in custody today after being accused of plotting an election day terrorist attack. The suspect entered the US on a special immigrant visa.

Speaker 24 (38:19):

Gut wrenching new details in the murder of Georgia, nursing student Laken Riley. The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuelan national who crossed the unsecured southern border back in 2022.

Speaker 15 (38:32):

Two men investigators say are in the country illegally from Venezuela are charged with capital murder in the death of Jocelyn Nungaray.

Speaker 25 (38:38):

A fifth illegal immigrant accused of attacking two New York City police officers over the weekend showed no remorse or regret.

Speaker 19 (38:46):

Would you have done something differently?

Speaker 20 (38:48):

There is done a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 26 (38:52):

Oh, really? 18% say the economy is in excellent or good condition.

Speaker 27 (38:54):

US inflation has hit a new 40-year high, increasing by 9.1% over the financial year.

Speaker 28 (39:01):

The cost of homes have spiked. Home buyers need to earn 80% more than they did in 2020 to afford a house.

Speaker 19 (39:09):

Were you the last person in the room?

Speaker 20 (39:10):

Yes.

President Donald J. Trump (39:17):

How dumb an answer. The whole campaign is based around the fact that she’s not going to do what Biden did. And then I was waiting. I was watching that one live. I got to watch my things. It’s part of my business, right? It’s a little different, but I had to watch it, and I said, oh, this is going to be a killer answer. I assumed she was going to go through a whole list of things that she’d do differently. She said she wouldn’t… The worst president in history, and she said she’d do it the same. That answer that you would do nothing differently is a totally disqualifying answer. It disqualifies her from running. Think of this. 86% of the country feels that we’re on the wrong track, and she’s giving it. Can you

President Donald J. Trump (40:00):

… you imagine? 86% record of the country feels that we’re on the wrong track. Doesn’t that tell you something? It tells you we got a problem. I actually worry about the next three months. I really do. I worry about the next three and a half, four months. We’ll end up in a World War because of the people that we have. And if you’re on the wrong track by that amount, how can you keep someone who has stated plainly and clearly that she would do nothing, she’d do nothing from Biden? With your vote, I will act with urgency and speed to save America and to rescue the people of California from Kamala Harris’s atrocious failures.
(40:45)
I will very quickly deflate… We are going to take inflation and we are going to deflate it. We are going to deflate inflation. We are going to defeat inflation. We’re going to knock the hell out of inflation. We’re going to use a thing that we have more of than anybody else, it’s called liquid gold, oil and gas. And we’re going to make America affordable again. For all of the working people struggling under the highest taxed state in the nation, we will have large tax cuts. We’re going to give large tax cuts for workers, and we will… Ready? No tax on tips, no tax on overtime and no tax on social security benefits for our seniors. None.
(41:46)
By contrast, Kamala is known as the taxing queen. The only election I’ve ever seen where they say, “We’re going to raise your taxes. Vote from me, I’m going to raise your taxes by 72% or something,” and they’re going to end the Trump tax cuts. I gave you the largest tax cuts in the history of our country, larger than the Reagan tax cuts. They’re going to end them, add that to it. Her plan will raise taxes for the typical American family by more than $3,000 a year.
(42:16)
In Detroit two days ago, I also announced that we will make interest on car loans fully deductible because affording a car is essential to restoring the American dream. We’ve lost the American dream in this country. We have lost it for our young people. They want the American dream. They want to have a great life like Elon Musk. They like his life.
(42:40)
How good was he the other night? Did you see him? He was so happy. He lives a reclusive life, the life of a super genius. But he’s rather dark MAGA. That’s right. He’s a different kind of a guy. He’s great. He sees a hat. I didn’t even know we made them. It’s all black with black letters. That’s called very subtle, right? You hardly even see Make America Great Again. He fell in love with it and he wore it. I don’t think he’s taken it off in weeks. He wore it. And I said, “What is that?” He said, “It’s dark MAGA.” I said, “Elon. That’s the coolest thing I’ve ever seen.”
(43:20)
Anyway, he gave us the best endorsement. He endorsed me a few months ago. He said, “If Trump doesn’t win, it’s probably the end of our country.” He means that too, by the way. He means that. And you know where he is today? He’s campaigning in Pennsylvania for me. That’s how good… He feels it’s so important. And I really think we won’t have a country left. Elon… Oh, he’ll be…

Speaker 29 (43:54):

Elon, Elon, Elon, Elon, Elon, Elon, Elon, Elon.

President Donald J. Trump (43:54):

He’s a great guy. But really, I got involved last week because as you know, Biden and Harris have done a horrible job on North Carolina and some of the other ones, in particular the first of the hurricanes that came in. It really wiped out North Carolina. And a person called, a person I know, an official in North Carolina and says, “Sir, we’re wiped out here. All our lines are down. We have no power. We have absolutely no communication.” It became to the mainland. What happened is the water was so high, it created… They were literally landlocked. And he said, “Do you know Elon Musk?” And I said, “Yeah, I do. What do you need?” He said, “We need Starlink.” I said, “What the hell is Starlink?” True. I said, “Elon, what the hell is Starlink?” No. I said, “What is Starlink?” He said, “Communication. Very good communication.”
(44:41)
So I called Elon. I said, “Elon, they’re in big trouble in North Carolina. They need Starlink and you guys…” They’re doing so well with it. It’s a very hard thing to get. So I said, “You guys, is there anything you can do?” In the meantime, my phone rings and it’s the guy from North Carolina thanking me and I’m still on the phone with Elon. I said, “Elon, what the hell did you do? You told them that you’ve got it before I even hung up.” So he’s on a different planet than us, right? He said, “Yeah.” He said, “Yeah, you were talking and I was going…” Whatever.
(45:16)
And he got it. He got them a lot of it. He got it… And I said to the people, “What’s better, that or the hard line?” He said, “Actually, Starlink is better. Starlink is better.” But he’s a great guy and he’s done a great job. And it’s too bad that Kamala didn’t do… I don’t even know she… She’s essentially not even gone there essentially. But what happened in North Carolina and then Ron DeSantis, who’s done a very good job in Florida, he didn’t want her even involved. He was dealing with Biden. He didn’t want her involved.
(45:46)
I will also cancel Kamala’s insane electric vehicle mandate. Isn’t it crazy? You guys, you have brownouts, blackouts. California’s brownouts and blackouts every weekend, every day. And now she says, “Let’s go all electric cars.” These people are crazy. And the thing is that… And they’re great. I like electric, but they’re for a certain market. The amazing thing with Elon? He makes the Tesla. And he’s a friend of mine. He has never called up and said, “Would you do me a favor? Would you lay the hell off the electric car?” Because he understands. He’s got a great market. It’s a smart market. It’s a more expensive car. It’s got some great things and some assets, but you also have to let gas propelled, gasoline propelled cars in and hybrids in.
(46:48)
They have another one now. You ever hear about the hydrogen? It’s hydrogen. The problem with hydrogen, has one fault. Somebody says it’s better than everything. Got one fault. If it blows up, you’re not recognizable. It’s true. In other words, it doesn’t happen much, maybe once a day in the nation, if the hydrogen car blows up, it’s gone. You’re gone. Your wife looks at a tree and there’s nothing but blood on the tree. She said, “I just can’t tell. Is that my husband?”
(47:17)
No, these are serious problems. They wanted to give me one. I said, “No thanks. I don’t want one.” No, I’ll take electric. But isn’t that something? Elon never called up. But he never said that. Swore to you he never said it. And he said… whereas Biden would say, “Oh no, I’m not kidding.” You remember when he’d say, “Yes, we’ve been threatened with war by Russia.” No, no, I’m not joking. He always says, “I’m not joking about the…” No, no, I’m not joking. I don’t know if anybody understands that. But he’s a weird dude, I’ll tell you. They called JD Vance and me weird. How about the vice president, her and Biden, the combination.
(47:56)
But by the way, how good a job did JD Vance do the other night? Our JD.

Speaker 29 (48:04):

JD, JD, JD, JD, JD, JD, JD.

President Donald J. Trump (48:12):

I shouldn’t say it, but I took him in because he has a very good brain. We like smart people. He’s very smart. He was a top, top student at Ohio State. He finished in two years, top of his class. And then I didn’t know you could do that actually, but he finished two years. Then he went to the military, was outstanding in the military. Then he came out, he went to Yale Law School and he and his wife were like top, top students. And I sort of picked him a little bit for the brain.
(48:40)
We had a lot of great people. We have a lot of great people that were in that group and any one of them would’ve been fantastic. But JD did a great job the other night. The guy that he went against, you ever hear a guy call himself a knucklehead and he’s in a debate? He’s the biggest liar. He lied about everything. And how come he went to China 28 times? What’s going on? He went to China. Nobody asked him that one question. I kept saying, “Somebody ask him the question, why was he in China 28 times?”
(49:11)
There’s a guy that’s got some problems. By the way, if you think she’s all right, she’s not. I think she’s worse than him too, actually. But he went to China 28 times and I’m waiting for somebody to ask him that question. It won’t be the fake news, I can tell you that. It won’t be those people.
(49:28)
And I will not allow California politicians to get away with their plan to impose a 100% ban on the sale of gas-powered cars and trucks in your state. Not going to let it… That’ll be ended in the first day. That’ll be ended. These people, it’s unbelievable. To bring jobs, factories, and wealth racing back to our shores, we will have a 15% made in America corporate tax rate. In other words, you have to make your product in America. Then you have only 15. Remember, I brought it down to 21% from almost 40%. Everyone said, “There’s no way you’ll be able to.” I had to get it passed in Congress. Could you believe it?
(50:07)
Again, it’s the greatest tax cut, the biggest tax cut and regulation cuts, the most regulations ever cut by a president by, I think three or four times actually, which I think is actually more important. I asked a lot of the big executives of the biggest companies, what was more important, the tax cut where we took them from almost 40% to 21% or the regulation cuts? Every single one of them said the regulation cuts, which actually surprised me, but it was the regulation. But I got you down to 21. And 21 is highly competitive with other countries.
(50:42)
We’re dealing with other countries because they’ll take our businesses in two seconds. It’s not like, “Oh gee, you’re not going to give them and they’re going to sit still.” They don’t care about our country. Many of them aren’t even from America. They’re not from the U.S. They’re international business people. Very smart. And they will leave here in two seconds if they can get something substantially. So I came up with this idea. So now I have you at 21, brought you all the way down and I said, “If you make your product here, you don’t have to pay 21, you can pay 15.” And people called me from all over the planet. I got calls from the top guys on the Wall Street, “Who the hell gave you that idea? That’s so good.”
(51:21)
And I oftentimes say it’s like the paper clip. Somebody came up with the idea for a paper clip a hundred years ago. They look at it and everybody looked at it and said, ” Why the hell didn’t I think of that?” It’s like the same thing. And for those who don’t make their product in America, they’ll be forced to pay stiff tariffs for the privilege of competing with our cherished companies and stealing our jobs, our treasure, our wealth. And we will take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs to the benefit of American citizens and pay off debt or we’re going to take care of our… We owe $35 trillion. We’re going to start cutting it down very quickly. We’ll be able to with growth. We call it growth, but we’re going to do that. We’re going to protect these companies with tariffs.
(52:07)
Remember this, in many years, many decades, China never paid 10 cents. And what they did to our country was incredible. I took in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and taxes from China. I don’t think they liked me, but actually, I liked them. And we actually had a very good relationship, President Xi and myself. Somebody said, “What kind of a man is he?” He’s a fierce person. He is. He’s a very smart guy. I hate to say brilliant because every time I call him brilliant, the press said, “You said the president…” Well, he is a brilliant guy. Got 1.4 billion people. He rules it with an iron fist and the press gets upset when I say he’s a smart man. I would think he’s a smart man, but actually, he’s somebody that we can… The worst people are the enemies from within, the sleaze bags like the guy that you’re going to elect to the Senate, Shifty Adam Schiff. He’s a sleaze bag.
(53:04)
This guy… No, no, he’s a major low life. And because of the fact that they send millions and millions of ballots someplace, they send them all over the place, California, you don’t have anything like a voting booth. They take ballots, they just send them all over the place. They come back and they say, “Oh, somebody won by five million votes.” And it’s so corrupt, so corrupt. But you’re going to have Shifty Adam Schiff, one of the true… I know him well because he conceived of the Russia hoax, the Russia, Russia hoax. He is a bad person. He’s a sick person, not a stupid guy, but he’s a sick puppy that guy.
(53:46)
One of the least… I’m not allowed to say this because this could cost you your president because you’re not supposed to talk about somebody’s looks, and so I won’t. But to me, he’s one of the least attractive human beings I think I’ve ever seen. Not a stupid person. He’s got the smallest neck I’ve ever seen. No, he’s got the smallest neck. His neck is so small and his head is large, so he’s not being held up by much. I can guarantee you, he will not be playing for your local football team, I guarantee.
(54:28)
But we’re pleased to be joined today by some incredible people and friends of mine and warriors, real warriors, Representatives Darrell Issa. Where’s Darrell? Is he here? Darrell? He’s a great guy. Matt Gaetz. Is Matt Gaetz… Oh, look at Matt Gaetz. He’s a great guy. He’s really a great person. And he’s on the controversial side, but that’s not bad. And is he here with Ginger? He’s here with Ginger. Hi Ginger. And Ken Calvert, and he is here someplace. Where’s Ken? Ken, thank you. Good job, Ken. Very good job. Do we have enough people for you guys? Do we have enough? Broke the record.
(55:15)
There’s Mr. Tom Barrack. I didn’t recognize him with that hat on. Look at him. Stand up, Tom. Great guy. Great businessman, actually. He’s a great businessman. But everybody needs to get out and vote for Ken, who’s running right now. A radical California liberal is running against him. And I gave him a very strong endorsement. I put it out on Truth a little while ago. You saw that. And I want to mention, I heard you were here and I want to mention, so good luck. Get out and vote for Ken Calvert, everybody.
(55:47)
We also have members of our great Native American tribes. They’re fantastic people. We have the chiefs. We have… Where are they? They’re here. Where are they? They’re phenomenal people and they’re doing a beautiful job. They’re great. And we also have a lot of farmers here today. We do very well with the farmers. But the farmers are having a little rough spot because Biden and Kamala are not doing their job. I never use the word Harris. If I say Harris, nobody knows who the hell I’m talking about. I say, “Harris is doing a terrible job.” And they go, “Who the hell is Harris?” It’s a funny name. It’s a name, you know what I’m talking about, Tom? It’s a name that nobody knows what the hell I’m talking about. So I call her Kamala.
(56:38)
We also have a really great governor, governor that I’ve gotten to know really well in the last six, seven months. And he’s doing a terrific job, Spencer Cox of Utah, and he’s here someplace. It’s a big crowd. He’s here someplace amongst a hundred thousand people. Former National Security Advisor, Robert O’Brien. Good man. Thank you, Robert. And Robert went out and got all of the top people in government, 300 and something of them, more than 300, and he went out and got them all and they all came in the last couple of days and endorsed Trump.
(57:14)
They said, “Trump is the greatest president we’ve ever had.” 300… The top… We only had one problem, Matt. The press refused to cover it, Robert, all that work. But we had 300 of the top people in the country. In fact, people that didn’t even like me totally said, “He’s great. I don’t like him. But man, was he good.” Because I protected our country. And that was great. But the press hasn’t picked it up too much. I’ll have to give it to Matt Gaetz. Robert, give him the list.
(57:44)
If that were Kamala, they’d make it headlines with Trump 300, much more than they had. And these are much better people than they had too, that I can tell you. Because remember this, I kept your country safe. We had no wars, and I’ll keep you out of wars. But we did have one, which I had to finish up, ISIS. It was supposed to take five years, but it took me two months.
(58:08)
We also have a man who’s a really fantastic person. He’s really great. Did an unbelievable job on lots of things. He actually started off as the ambassador to Germany. And the greatest day in Angela Merkel’s life was the day I took him out to promote him. She said, “Oh my God, thank you.” He drove Angela crazy and that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. His name is Rick Grenell. Thank you, Rick. And he did a fantastic… And Kash Patel is here, one of our real warriors, a real warrior, and also somebody that’s doing a beautiful job out here, even though, sadly, when you’ve sent out 38 million ballots and just send them out, they come back, what the hell? We’re going to have to work on that when we get in. We’re going to have to work on elections.
(59:07)
We need borders, and we need fair elections, and we’re going to work on it. But she is doing a great job, and she says I’m setting all sorts of records, GOP Chair, California, Jessica Patterson. Jessica, thank you very much. Thank you. Great job. Just really good job. Somebody else who was so fantastic today. He’s tough. He’s a sheriff and he’s [inaudible 00:59:39]. He [inaudible 00:59:39] that way. And he had the most beautiful family I’ve ever seen. Everybody’s like a perfect specimen. I said, “Sheriff, you’re great, but your family looks even better than you.” And I liked him from the moment I met him and I talked to him a little bit. Because this was not an easy one to pull off, let me tell you. We had a lot more people than some people thought. A lot of people thought this was what we

President Donald J. Trump (01:00:00):

… you’re going to have, but a lot of people said maybe you’d have 10,000, maybe 20,000, but they didn’t say 100,000. But he pulled it off, and he pulled it off because he’s tough, and he’s smart, and he’s proud of his state and his country. Chad Bianco. Thank you, Chad. He is like central casting. Thank you, Chad. What a family, though. Look at the family. Thank you, thank you both. Great.
(01:00:33)
Another man, he wrote a song it went to number one on all the lists, you saw it. We put it … That’s right. He said Tom McDonald, he’s Tom McDonald. Tom? Where’s Tom? Thank you, Tom. That’s a great song, too, I was honored by it. He did the song, and I didn’t know Tom as well as others and now I know him very well, but he did the song and it went to number one on every single list.
(01:01:07)
And another man is here, and I thought the movie was great. Dennis Quaid is here with his brother, Randy Quaid. Two very good guys. That movie was great. Ronald Reagan. Did you like him, did you like Reagan? You liked him. He liked Reagan. He liked Reagan. I think you have to like him to play him that way. You did a beautiful job, thank you.
(01:01:36)
And a very rich guy. He owns this piece of land, and he’s been after me for three years. “Please use it, just use it. We love you, sir.” He’s an unbelievable patriot, an unbelievable Republican. But you know what? That’s less important, he loves our country. Al and Betty, we have to say, Hagen. Where’s Al Hagen? Where is Al? Al Hagen.

Al Hagen (01:02:06):

Great.

President Donald J. Trump (01:02:07):

Thank you, Al.

Al Hagen (01:02:07):

A great property.

President Donald J. Trump (01:02:09):

Nice property, Al. I used to be in the business, it’s very nice. That was really beautiful, thank you, Al.
(01:02:15)
And Steve Hilton is here, who’s been on television doing a fantastic job, where’s Steve? Where is Steve? He’s around. And we have a lot of other people. We have a lot of Congressmen, we have some Senators, but I’ve had it. That’s enough of this stuff.
(01:02:29)
But I also want to send our love to all of the people back East who are recovering from two really devastating storms, hurricanes. Our hearts are with those who lost a loved one or a home and that was a rough one, God bless them all.
(01:02:45)
Kamala Harris is grossly incompetent. She didn’t do a good job. She didn’t do a good job. She’s got to do a good job, and she didn’t. But the most radical Left Vice President in American history, that’s what she’s known for. She did so bad in so many different ways, and we’re going to get onto a much more pleasant subject, it’s called the revitalization of our country.
(01:03:10)
We have a situation in our country where we’re not going to let people continue to destroy it. California has been horribly mismanaged. Nothing has been managed worse than water. Do you know water? It sounds simple. Oh, water, what the hell is water? I was with Devin Nunes. Did anyone ever hear of Devin Nunes? He was brave. He got big awards for what he did, he’s very brave. He’s the one that figured out the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax with Jim Jordan, the great Jim Jordan. Two great guys. He’s now running Truth and doing a very good job. Truth, get on to Truth.
(01:03:46)
But Devin, I’m riding up California and we’re going up toward the north and we look at this land. I said, “Why is it all so barren? And then right in the middle of it you have this little green spot that’s so beautiful, so vibrant.” He said, “Because they have no water.” I said, “Oh, I didn’t know you had a drought. Do you have a drought?” “No. We take all of our water way up north and we route into the Pacific Ocean. So instead of coming down to past the farms where you take the farms, you had thousands and thousands of acres that was dead bone dry.
(01:04:19)
And they tell me, farmers tell me, it’s the finest land in the country, it’s like Iowa land. It’s the finest land in the country, but they have no water. Artificially, they reroute it because they want to save, there’s a fish, Delta smelt. Anyone ever hear of it? And it’s not just in this area. By the way, the Delta smelt is doing extremely badly, especially since it has no water. They think they have a fish and their way of saving the fish is not to give it water. Somehow that doesn’t work.
(01:04:52)
But you have a little Delta smelt, but you have other areas, so it’s not like to this area only. And millions and millions of gallons of water over a short period of time gets pumped right into the Pacific Ocean. They have a giant faucet like your sink, except a thousand times bigger. It takes one day, they turn it. It’s a big valve it goes over and the water pours by the millions of gallons. It pours into the Pacific Ocean, which for the Pacific is like a drop. Just like it drop. And if they turn that faucet the way it should be, it’s been that way for years. And I went to your Governor and he said, “Well, the hard part is the Federal Government. It was actually Department of Commerce, and I got it worked out at Department of Commerce. Within two months everything was done. Then I went to see Gavin Newsom and I said… And, they didn’t want to do it. They had all sorts of reasons, nonsense. They use the environment. Everybody uses the environment to stop things. But, we’re not going to let that happen because it was toward the end and we’re not going to ever let that happen again. You would have so much water. I read where in Beverly Hills and Bel-Air, they want bring you down to like 28 gallons a person. That sounds like a lot. But you know what that is like about a seven-minute shower. You spend a fortune for a house and you can’t take a shower.
(01:06:22)
So, we’re going to take care of our farmers. We’re going to take care of your water situation, and we’ll force it down his throat. And we’ll say, “Gavin, if you don’t do it, we’re not giving you any of that fire money that we send you all the time for all the forest fires that you have.” It’s not hard to do. We just had so many other things to do. I was working on two Russia hoaxes, I was working on impeachments, I was working on indictments. They went out of their way to keep me busy, because they didn’t want this to happen. They didn’t want this. It could have happened to nobody else, believe me.
(01:06:59)
But Devin has done a fantastic job. We are going to have, that farmland is going to be the most fertile land. One of the farmers told me, “Sir, it’s the best land in the country. They won’t give us any water.” I actually said, “Oh, you have a drought?” I figured they didn’t have rain. I said, “No, the opposite. We have so much water, we don’t know what to do with it.” But they won’t let the water come down. I think these guys actually hate our country, if you think. I think they hate our country.
(01:07:27)
With your vote this November, we are going to defeat this radical Left country destroyer, her and him, and we’re going to finish what we so brilliantly started. We have so many different things, and yet we’re very consequential. You know how I know that? Because only consequential Presidents get shot at. You know that? It’s true.
(01:07:51)
Biden’s got no problem sleeping on the beach. If I slept on the beach, it would last very short. Wouldn’t be good. The Secret Service wouldn’t be too happy. Say, “Kids, I want to go to sleep on the beach.” Who the hell sleeps in front of the paparazzi, the media? How do you sleep in front of the media? The cameras are rolling, and he’s lazy. And you know the amazing thing? He’s out cold within two or 3 minutes. I could never do that.
(01:08:19)
I toss and turn at night. I sweat, I toss and turn thinking about things and deals. “How am I going to get China for what they’re doing? How am I going to do this?” I toss and turn and toss and turn. I then wake up, and then I go to work and then I go late to bed, I toss and turn. He goes to the beach. He Lays down and he falls asleep. Within two minutes he stone-cold out. They’re always showing him in pictures, he’s stone-cold out. I consider that actually a great ability, I’d like to have some of it. Not all of it. I’d like to have a little bit of it. Maybe he can sell it. If he could, he would do it, I promise you.
(01:08:55)
We will quickly become energy independent and we will frack, frack, frack and drill, baby drill. And, I will cut your energy prices in half within 12 months. Your energy prices will be cut within 12 months. And remember what I said, California, you’re going to have so much water, you’re not going to know what the hell to do with it. They’re going to call me. Remember about winning when I used to do this about winning? They’re going to call me in the White House and they’re going to say, “Sir, please, please, we have too much water. We’re flooding. Please sir. Please, we have too much water.” Right now. You don’t have any water. Artificial. It’s artificial. “Sir, please could we see you? We have far too much water.”
(01:09:47)
I will stop outsourcing and turn the US into a manufacturing superpower, and I will end a war in Ukraine, stop the chaos in the Middle East. And I will prevent very definitely World War III. We’re very close to World War III. Very, very close. Are they okay back there? Take your time, doctor. Doctor, thank you. Is there a doctor? Doctor in the house? Yeah. Take your time, please. Don’t forget, they’ve been here for two days, three days. These guys have been here for a long time, so take your time.

President Donald J. Trump (01:10:56):

Thank you very much, great. Thank you Doctor. Let’s give that incredible person a hand. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. They’ve been here, a lot of people have been here a long time. And I know you didn’t notice, it was about 100 degrees out today. It’s not exactly cool up here either, but now it’s pretty nice. In fact, now we could go on all night, it’s suddenly getting very nice. We go all night. Right? Front row Joe stands up. They want to go all night, I’ll tell you,
(01:11:53)
I will crush the violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources, and the respect that they deserve. They’re great people. They’re going to end our crime problem very quickly. All we have to do is give them the word, they’re ready to go. They don’t want to lose their house, they don’t want to lose their car, they don’t want to lose their job, their pension. What they do to our police, our police are incredible. They want to do the job, they’re not allowed to do the job. When thugs walk into a department store 400 or 500, they walk out with refrigerators, could you believe it? With air conditioners. And our police are told to stand back, they’re not going to stand back, and we’re going to indemnify them against any problems they have, Federally.
(01:12:36)
We will end all sanctuary cities and in California we’re going to get rid of your sanctuary cities. They’re cities to protect criminals. We will strengthen and modernize our military. We will build a missile defense shield, and it’ll all be made in the USA and a lot of it right here in California. And we will not have a woke military. Take a look.

Let me see your war face.
(01:13:30)
Sir.

Speaker 33 (01:13:31):

You’ve got a war face. Ah, that’s a war face. Now let me see your war face. Ah. You didn’t convince me. Let see your real war face. Ah.

Speaker 34 (01:13:50):

You will be a weapon. You will be a minister of death, praying for war. But until that day, you are huge. You are the lowest form of life on earth. You are not even coming big. You are nothing but unorganized, rambastic pieces of amphibian shit.

Speaker 32 (01:14:46):

1, 2, 3, 4, United States Marine Corps.

President Donald J. Trump (01:14:46):

We’re not going to be woke. We will rebuild our cities, including our Capital in Washington DC, which is a disgrace what they’ve let happen to it. With graffiti all over the beautiful Aurora marble. They have the most beautiful marble, they have graffiti all over the place. They have roads with potholes. We’re going to fix up our Capital, we’re going to make it so beautiful. As well as Los Angeles and San Francisco. We’re going to bring them back and make them safe, and clean, and beautiful again. And I will support universal school choice, which is so important.
(01:15:20)
And we will get Critical Race Theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools. And we will keep men out of women’s sports. I will defend the Second Amendment, protect religious liberty, restore free speech, and we will secure our elections like they’ve never been secured before. And under the Trump Administration, we will put American citizens first. American children first. American patients first. American taxpayers first. American workers first. And American communities, we’re going to put them first. But we will put communists, Marxists, and fascists last. They’re going to be last. And they will always be last.
(01:16:26)
We will defend our territory, we’ll defend our families. We will defend our communities. We will defend our civilization. We will not be conquered, we will not be occupied. We will not be invaded, we will reclaim our sovereignty. We will reclaim our nation, and I will give back your freedom, and give back your life.
(01:16:51)
Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical Left agenda once and for all. And we want record numbers, we want to make it too big to rig. We want to go out and have record numbers. Get everyone you know and vote. After all we’ve been through together and we’ve been through a lot, we’ve watched our country disintegrate right in front of us. We stand on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of our country, I think we could do that. I think these have a chance to be the four greatest years in the history of our country.
(01:17:41)
And with your help from now until Election Day, we will redeem America’s promise and we will back the nation that we love. November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country, I believe that. And take back our country. And together, we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you very much, California and thank you everybody. God bless you, God bless you.","Coachella, California","2024-10-13",13,8,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0

Donald Trump (02:32):

Wow. Thank you. Thank you, amazing. Thank you very much. And a very, very big hello to Wisconsin, it’s great to be back. Before I start, they say that Wisconsin is probably the toughest of the swing states to win. I don’t think so at all. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. We have got the biggest crowds. They’ve never seen crowds like this. This is unbelievable, actually. I could be anywhere right now. I could be beautiful beaches, I could be all over the world, but I’d rather be right here. What’s more beautiful, we are going to win the greatest election in history. And it’s incredible to be back in this beautiful state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots, which is what you are. Just 30 days from now, we’re going to win the state of Wisconsin. We’re going to defeat Kamala Harris, and we are going to make America great again. We’re going to do it. We’re going to do it. And quickly, we’re going to do it quickly.
(03:43)
And when we win, it will be considered the greatest political victory in American history, you know that? I saw that. I saw that. I’ve never really said it that way. I’ve said it in a lot of different ways, but not that way. And I saw one of these Democrat, I guess congressmen in this case. He said, “If he does this,” because we’re leading in all the polls, we’re leading everywhere. Leading in Wisconsin too, by the way, which is very good. You see, because this is the ultimate poll, when you get this many people, this is the ultimate poll. But they had this congressman and he said, “If he does this, it’s going to be like the greatest political win in the history of our country.” And I said, “Wow, that’s great.” I love that. We love that, Troy, don’t we? So it will be incredible. And I think we’re going to have something that’s going to be amazing. The world is going to be watching, and we’re 30 days away, 30 days away.
(04:50)
You have to get it. But we had an incredible evening last night in Butler, Pennsylvania. It was a beautiful evening. It was a very different kind of an evening. It was a tribute to a very brave firefighter Cory, he was a real Trumper. Cory was a Trumper. He was a MAGA guy, he was an America First guy. He had the whole deal going with the outfits, the hats. He had everything he was great, and his whole family is great, But you really look at it the way I look at it. He sacrificed his life in an attack 12 weeks ago, and you have to look at what happened last night. We had over a 100,000 people show up in beautiful little Butler. It’s little Butler, but beautiful Butler, Pennsylvania. We had a crowd, and this is a hell of a crowd too, I have to tell you, it’s happening all over.
(05:50)
But we had a 100,000 people and there was love. And I had a fantastic, Christopher, I had a great opera singer and he went up and he sang Ave Maria. You saw that. We had a short moment of silence, and then the bells rang and they said, “Where do we get bells?” They said, why don’t we just take them off the Cathedral of Notre Dame? He said, “Those are good bells,” and you actually have tapes. So we said, “Let’s use them. Maybe nobody’s going to find out.” We had these magnificent bells ring. And then Christopher got up, one of the best opera singers I’ve ever heard, and he got up and sang Ave Maria during this moment of silence. It was an unbelievable evening. And we have something to show you the kind of crowd we had last night, it was really something special. So let’s put it up if we can.
(06:45)
It’s the wrong picture That was unbelievable. They used the wrong picture. It’s the same picture, but they had the two side things is so stupid. But that’s what, we have that every once in a while, we have that. That seldom happens, but you got the gist of it. It was an unbelievable crowd, so unbelievable. And there was a lot of love in the room, and it was really in honor of somebody, so that was a different kind of an evening, I’ll tell you. That was an evening to celebrate somebody who had died, and this is an evening to, a day to celebrate just really greatness because we’re going to have something so special happen. We’ve never seen anything like it. You can go around any place in the country now and you have signs all over the place, Trump and Trump. And by the way, how good did JD Vance do the other night? That was a good pick. That was a good pick. That was a very good pick.
(08:17)
But from the very beginning of this journey, I’ve been on a mission to rescue our nation from a failed and corrupt political establishment and corrupt people. Frankly, they are the most corrupt people. That’s the most corrupt group I’ve ever seen, ever. Nobody’s ever seen a group like that. And to give you back the country you believe in, the country that you were born in, and the country that you deserve. And in that mission, I will never quit. I will never bend, I will never break, and I will never yield. I’m like these guys over here from Texas. And I really believe all of us, we say, “Not even in the face of death itself, I will not.”
(09:07)
This is so important what we’re doing, we’re saving our country. This country is in big trouble. We’re a failing nation. We are a failing nation. We’re a nation in decline. We’re a nation in distress, and we’re going to get it fixed very quickly. But you know what? If we have to go with another four years of these people, these people. And she’s worse than Biden, in my opinion. First of all, I think Biden is actually far more intelligent, if you can believe that. Can you believe? I think he’s more intelligent than she is. But I’m putting everything on the line to fight for you, and we’re going to fight for you, and we’re all going to win together. It’s going to be the greatest win in the history of our country. I believe that. I believe it. Thank you. Thank you.
(10:11)
And I’m only asking you to do one thing. We don’t even need your money. Keep your money. Just go out and vote. Get everybody and vote. Go and get them and vote. Kamala Harris, I tell people, I say, ” You can’t use the name Harris. Nobody knows who the hell she is.” You say Harris, if you say Harris, they say, who’s Harris? I don’t know what it is. The name doesn’t catch on. So, we’ll use the word Kamala. Kamala. But Kamala is a disastrous, radical, and grossly incompetent vice president who has betrayed our country and the people she swore an oath to serve. She was our border czar, and you know what? She doesn’t want to call that. So let’s not call her that. She was in charge of the border, okay? It’s the worst border in the history of the world. They announced last week that 13,099 murderers were released during their term. They then tried to say, “Well, it wasn’t really …” And somebody released it and we don’t know who, but it was a patriot that released it, because she got up and tried to say that when she’s in going to do this, she’s going to do that. Why the hell didn’t she do it four years ago, right?
(11:36)
But she threw open our border, destroyed the middle class, and now as our citizens are suffering from catastrophic hurricane, I mean, this hurricane has been a bad one, Kamala Harris has left them stranded. This is the worst response to a storm or a catastrophe or a hurricane that we’ve ever seen ever. Probably worse than Katrina, and that’s hard to beat, right? Worse than Katrina. They didn’t do too good a job either, but this is worse. And she sends their money to foreign nations. He and she, they send hundreds of billions of dollars. They send hundreds of billions of dollars to foreign nations. And you know what? They’re giving our people 750 bucks. 700. Here, I’ll tell you. This is the worst response I think. Troy, what do you think? The worst? Never saw one like this? This guy troy is good, but I’m going to bring him up. This guy, he’s got a brother who might be better. I don’t know. He’s damn good. I’ll tell you, what a group we have up here.
(12:48)
The patriots, the patriotism, all we want to do is take our country back and fix it. We want to fix our country. That’s all we want to do. Is that asking so much? Time and time again, Kamala has proven that she cannot be trusted and she can’t do the job. First of all, she’s grossly incompetent. I don’t care. She doesn’t do interviews. They said, “Why doesn’t she do?” Because she is incompetent. She can’t answer the question. She can’t answer anything. And I don’t know, they want to do 60 Minutes. Remember, I had it out with them last time? Because they had the laptop from hell and they said it was from Russia. I said, “No, it was from Hunter.” I turned out to be right. Remember Leslie Stahl, and she’s another real heavyweight. Leslie Stahl. We got into an argument on 60 Minutes and I turned out to be right. But to the best of my knowledge, I have not received an apology. That was a big deal at the time. She said, “How dare you? You shouldn’t say that. This was from Russia.” I said, “It wasn’t from Russia, it was from Hunter.” It’s terrible. So we’re waiting for an apology. They want to do it again. I’ll do it again. But they got to … Don’t you think I should make them apologize?
(14:09)
If you want a president to inundate your towns with illegal alien criminals. And by the way, every town and every little city and every big city frankly are petrified. Even if they haven’t arrived yet, they will be, because you’re talking about 21 million people at least just during this three-and-a-half year period. If you want someone who steals your wealth and abandons your family when the floods waters rise, those floodwaters rise and they were gone. They haven’t seen anybody from the federal government yet the federal government isn’t there.
(14:45)
And by the way, how good a guy is Elon Musk, right? You saw him last night. How good? I mean, that guy, I didn’t know anything about it. I get a call from a really good person in North Carolina. They said, the people, there’s no communication, they said, “Do you know a man named Elon Musk?” I said, Yeah, I do, actually. He endorsed me very strongly and we love him. He’s a smart cookie. A little different too. He’s a little different. But he is one smart cookie, sends the rocket ships up. The first time I ever saw the engines coming down, I said, “What was that?” “Well, we’d like to be able to save the engines.” It makes a lot of sense, but I never saw anything like that. This guy’s unbelievable.
(15:33)
So, what happens is, he was there last night, by the way, he got the biggest hand you’ve ever seen. People love him, but they said, “Do you know Elon Musk?” He didn’t know. And I said, “Yeah, I do. Why? What do you need?” He said, they have something called Starlink. Starlink. He said, “We have no communication in North Carolina. People are dying, like 500 people are missing. It’s a disaster. The federal government is doing, the White House is doing nothing. They’ve abandoned us,” and it’s largely a Republican area. So some people say they did it for that reason. I don’t even think they’re that bad, but they probably, maybe they are. But they want Starlink. So I said, whatever it is, let’s sell.
(16:20)
I call Elon, and you can’t get, it’s really popular. It’s very hard to get. But they need it and they need big doses of it like fast. And I’m calling Elon and said, “Elon in North Carolina and parts of Georgia,” and the governor is doing a very good job, by the way, in Georgia, I have to say. A very good job. “But in parts of Georgia and in real big parts of North Carolina, they need something called Starlink. I don’t know what the hell it is, and you don’t have to tell me because I don’t want to waste a lot of time, but would you be able to get it?” And we talked on the phone for a couple of minutes and during my conversation with him, I got a call from North Carolina thanking me for getting Starlink. I said, “How the hell did you do that? You’re talking to me. You didn’t have time.” He said, “Well, I have a system,” I think he’s doing. No, I mean he approved it while he was talking to me. Isn’t that crazy? Crazy.
(17:23)
We have got to be with, and we’ve got to protect our brilliant people because we don’t have too many of them. We need our brilliant people protected. And Kamala is not one of them, I can tell. But if you want a president who will do whatever it takes to protect you, who will never forsake you, and who will never rest in the defense of our nation, and I’ll tell you never. I’m just thinking it’s a beautiful phrase, but we will never rest. We’re never going to do anything that will be other than protect the people of our country and our nation. Then you better vote for a gentleman named Donald J. Trump, have you ever heard of him? Have you ever heard of him? Have you ever heard of him? Thank you.
(18:26)
Well, I’m going to always get the job done in America and for America. And one thing we always will do, and we’ve got to do now because for 50 years we haven’t done it, we will always put America first. It’s time for us to put America first. We did it four years ago, I can tell you. We were energy independent four years ago, can you believe it? We had the lowest energy prices, everything was the best. And that’s why they compare this with what it was, and people like us. We are the greatest economy in history, history of our country, and we did well.
(18:59)
And by the way, I’m just looking as far as the eye can see beyond, long beyond the fake news, that’s a lot of cameras back there, but long beyond the fake news. Look at all the … You can’t even see. That’s a lot of people. That’s a lot of people. Unbelievable, thank you. I always like to move the fake news way back, and I figured they have cameras that can do it, but that’s the maximum they can do. They say that’s the max, I don’t think it is. But they say that’s the max because I would’ve moved them way the hell to the back, if it were up to me. Because hey block the view. They’re blocking the view of these people. They block the view of all those people.
(19:46)
But this is like a poll and you have 50,000 people here, 50,000 people, and that is a lot. If we get just the people here to vote, I think we win. I think we win. With your vote in this election, we can seal our borders, we can reclaim our sovereignty, stop inflation, raise your incomes, rebuild our devastated communities, and launch a new golden age of American prosperity and pride. That’s what we’re going to do. It’s going to be American prosperity and American pride. But with four more years of Kamala Harris, your long nightmare is just beginning. Remember the word. Somebody said, “Give me one word to describe your opponent, Kamala Harris.” You know what I said? Incompetent. I said, “She’s incompetent.” She shouldn’t be in the position. In all fairness, I’m no fan of his, but we had him totally beat. We had the debate. He was gone and we were 20, 21 points up. And they walked in and they did a coup.
(20:55)
It was a coup of a guy that got 14 million votes. She got none. She was the first one out. She ran against him. He won. He got 14 million votes, he won. There were 22 people. She was the first one out. She never made it to a great place called Iowa. We love Iowa, the farmers, we love Iowa, but she never made it. She never made it to Iowa. And then all of a sudden we’re running against her. So they had 12 people plus her, and they wanted to be politically correct and they picked her. And I don’t know, I actually think if it keeps going like this like we’re doing, because they said she’d have a six-week honeymoon, and she did. She had a little bit of a honeymoon period.
(21:39)
They went from, the fake news, went from calling her horrible, the worst vice president, a total disaster, couldn’t speak, couldn’t do anything to being wonderful. She’s wonderful as soon … The fake news. They have the fake news as their partner, and we have a little news, our news has been … And I never understood why they’d want this, why the fake news would want it other than they hate our country. Because I can’t understand why do they want open borders? Why do they want sex change operations for people that are too young to even think about it? Why do they want men playing in women’s sports? Because we actually are now the party of common sense. I think that’s what I like calling us now, right? Party of common sense.
(22:34)
But with her in office, inflation will soar. You see where she’s working on inflation, nowhere. She has no idea what she’s talking about. She’s working on,” I will work on inflation.” Why didn’t you do it again four years ago? Why didn’t you do it again? My theme with her is: why didn’t you do it again? But why didn’t you do it then? Why didn’t you do it four years ago? Why wouldn’t you have done this stuff? You want to do this stuff? They want open borders, so now they gave it a little bit of a closure so the numbers look a little bit better than they did. The damage is done. We got 21 million people in here. We have 647,000 criminals released from jails and insane asylums released into our country. The damage is done.
(23:19)
But you say, “How could you be talking about the future? The damage is done.” They’ve got to be talking about getting these criminals immediately out of our country. We have to talk about that and we’re going to do it, and we’re going to do it rapidly. Why didn’t she do it four years ago? The economy will crash. Your borders will be permanently erased, your towns will be ravaged, and our country will never, ever be able to recover from this disaster. We’re going to recover fast. But if you go four more years, you may never recover. In fact, I will say, some people say it, I think it’s very severe, but I can understand it. Some people say, “You’ll never have an election again. This would be your last election.” And I can see it.
(24:07)
Remember I used to say, “We’ll be Venezuela on steroids.” And that’s sort of what’s happening. We’re Venezuela on steroids. And we’re buying a lot of Venezuela oil. How about this? We foreclosed on his old broken little plane, the dictator, the head, we foreclosed on his plane, but we buy billions of dollars of oil. Can you imagine that? It should be the opposite way, really, shouldn’t it? We took his plane away, but we give him billions of dollars a month in oil. Can you believe it? We’re buying oil from Venezuela. And we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country in the world, and it’s good.
(24:46)
And they don’t have oil, they have tar. They have tar. You have to melt it. And you know where it gets melted? In a refinery? You know where? In Houston, Texas. So if you’re environmentalist, all that stuff, I’m going to talk to you about this with Texas, all that stuff is going up into the air. We do it. It’s the only refinery in the world that can do it because basically they have a lot of tar and you have to melt it, and it’s a dirty process. We have the sweetest, lightest, most beautiful stuff. It’s not even believable.
(25:24)
The only way to avoid this miserable fate for America is if Wisconsin and the entire Midwest turn, and I mean turn out in record numbers. We need, and I hate to use this word, because they should have never done it with respect to COVID, they should have never done it. But for this, we need our mandate. They shouldn’t have done it with COVID. Everybody that did it should be ashamed of themselves what they did. But we need a mandate in the vote, and we’re going to get it. I actually think we’re going to have numbers like has maybe never been seen before. Last time in 2020, we got more votes by far, by millions than any sitting president in the history of the United States. Think of it. It’s unbelievable.
(26:27)
Think of the difference. We wouldn’t have had Russia going into Ukraine and killing millions of people. Millions of people have died in that war, much worse than you even hear. But that wouldn’t have happened, would’ve never happened. I talked to Putin about it a lot. It was the apple of his eye. He would have never ever done it. Wouldn’t have done it. On top of that, the oil prices went up so high that he had, I mean, he was making a lot of money doing it. It would have never happened. You wouldn’t have had October 7th with Israel, the attack on Israel. You wouldn’t have had inflation. You wouldn’t have had the Afghanistan, most embarrassing moment in the history of our country and we lost 13 great soldiers. Nobody ever talks about the 40 soldiers that were decimated so badly hurt, and we gave them $85 billion worth of the best equipment anywhere in the world. How stupid? And they moved out the military first. You’re supposed to move out the military last, not first.
(27:23)
And for 18 months, I spoke to Abdul, he’s still the leader of the Taliban, I spoke to him. I said, ” Abdul, don’t do it.” But we didn’t have one soldier killed in 18 months in Afghanistan. They were killing them like crazy under a man named Barack. Hussein Obama. Remember Rush Limbaugh? Remember Rush Limbaugh? Rush Limbaugh would go, “Barack Hussein Obama.” We miss Rush, we need rush. Oh we miss Rush. But they were killing them, A lot of soldiers. And I said, “Don’t do it. Don’t do it. Don’t do it.” We didn’t have one soldier 18 months killed until we had that tragedy of a day and a moment. The most embarrassing moment in history. And actually Russia I think went in because they saw how stupid we were with Millie and these guys that didn’t know what the hell they were doing. We have great generals, by the way, but not the guys that you see on television.
(28:22)
And you have to tell Kamala Harris that we’ve had enough. “We’ve had enough of you, you’re a horrible vice president. You destroyed San Francisco as the DA. You destroyed California as the Attorney General. You’re not going to destroy the United States of America. Kamala, you’re fired.” Get out of here. Fired. We are not going to let them do it, Troy. We’re not going to let her destroy our country. I mean, did you see where the teleprompter went off yesterday? She didn’t know what the hell. My teleprompter, I don’t even use it, that’s why. I don’t actually use it too much. But when you do this stuff a lot, teleprompters break. She had a bad moment yesterday. It broke, right? And she kept saying the same number over and over. I said, “What’s wrong with her?” And maybe it didn’t break. I don’t know. She said it broke.
(29:34)
But when you do this stuff as we say professionally, you’d better be, you better. I’ve lost it many times. I had one in Ohio for Bernie Marino, who’s doing pretty good up there. He’s running for the Senate just like Eric is doing great here. He’s running for the Senate. Eric Hovde, doing good. Good man. He’s a good man. Got to vote

Donald Trump (30:01):

But when you do it as much, it breaks. I was in Ohio. I think it was the windiest day ever in the history of Ohio. It was like Scotland and the wind was blowing at a level that I’ve never seen here in this part of the world. And the teleprompters were like sails, “Wah, wah.” And then they blew off the stage. They blew up. And we had 50,000 people. It was a great day because he took the lead right after that. A big beautiful lead in the primary. But it was sort of an amazing experience. But you lose him all the time and you have to be able to have a mind where you can actually speak without a teleprompter. And isn’t it nice to have a president that can speak without a teleprompter?
(30:54)
Isn’t it nice? [inaudible 00:30:55] But you lose him all the time. But she was in La La Land. She was gone and then it kicked in. She kept saying the same sentence over and over again over. I don’t know. I said, “What the hell is going on?” And then the teleprompter saved her. It kicked in, but it didn’t kick in soon enough, let me tell you. Early voting in Wisconsin is underway now. So if you have an absentee ballot, return it right away as soon as you can. You can also vote in person using an absentee ballot starting October 22.
(31:29)
And whatever you do, you have to get your friends, get them all out. You have a lot of people out there that don’t vote that love us, but they don’t vote. You know who doesn’t vote much? Rifle owners. We are Second Amendment people. But NRA gave us their total support. We have support from every group, but NRA gave us complete and total endorsement. And during that, I realized that because I’ve always gotten it from the NRA. They’ve been very nice to me, I’ll tell you. But they did tell me that people that own guns and rifles don’t vote relatively. A very small percentage, like 15%.
(32:07)
If you would vote, nobody could beat us. I’ll tell you another one that don’t vote. I love these people. Evangelicals. Evangelical Christians. The Christian community doesn’t vote as much as they should. They go to church. So now what we’re going to do is we’re going to go to church, so we’re going to get out and vote. But the evangelicals don’t vote that much. And if they did vote, we could never lose an election. You couldn’t lose.
(32:43)
So I have to be careful with this. I said once about a month ago, you only have to vote this one time, and after that everything would be good. And the fake news said, “See, he wants to be a dictator and take over the country.” No, no, that’s not what I said. We got to fix the country, got to make sure and then the country will be great and we’re going to have hopefully some great person, whether it’s JD or somebody else. And when the great Sean Hannity asked me a question and I jokingly said… He said, “Okay, let’s get this one. You don’t want to be a dictator, do you?” I said, “Sean, I only want to be a dictator for one day and I’m going to close the borders and drill baby drill. But after that, I know never want to be a dictator.”
(33:42)
So the fake news took that answer and they said, “Sean, I want to be a dictator.” Click, cut. So they said, “Sean, I want to be a dictator.” And they go, “He wants to be a dictator.” They cut the rest of the… These are the worst people. These are the worst. They said, “He’s a threat to democracy. He wants to be a dictator.” The threat to democracy are when you put incompetent people in charge of our country. That’s a real threat to democracy.
(34:14)
Starting on day one of my new administration, we will end inflation and we will make America affordable again because the prices are too high. The prices are too high. But if crazy, Kamala is reelected, one of the first acts will be, and she said this, is to massively raise taxes on American families. All my life, I’ve loved politics, but I’ve always been on the other side like writing checks to politicians.
(34:43)
So I really understand. I like it and all, but I’ve never seen somebody that openly campaigns on the fact that they’re going to raise taxes. It’s always going to be like when Troy is back in Texas, he’s always screaming, “I will lower taxes. Lower taxes.” We want to lower taxes. This group is going to raise your taxes by 78% or something and they campaign on it. This is the craziest campaign I’ve ever been involved in. I had one guy beat and I had… So I have to beat two people instead of one.
(35:16)
I spent $150 million beating Sleepy Joe Biden, who I admire greatly for one thing. I always have a hard time sleeping because I toss and turn. And honestly I do. I think about the country. I’m tossing and turning and tossing because I want to… Like a lot of people do. You have businesses, you toss and turn. It’s okay. It’s like become your way of life, right? We think about whatever we’re doing. In my case, I’m thinking about China. I’m thinking about Russia. I’m thinking about lots of things.
(35:47)
And by the way, the enemy from within, the crazy lunatics that we have, the fascists, the Marxists, the communists, the people that we have that are actually the country, not her, she’s not running it and Biden’s not running it either, and you all know that. Those people are more dangerous, the enemy from within than Russia and China and other people. Because if you have a smart president, you’ll be able to handle them very well. But Kamala Harris, lying Kamala is called the tax queen because she loves taxes. So maybe just watch this video. Thank you.

Video (36:25):

Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax bill.
(36:29)
Calling for a full repeal of President Trump’s tax cuts.
(36:32)
If Kamala Harris was elected president, there are many different tax policies which could cripple the economy, but the first thing she wants to do is allow these Trump tax cuts to expire.
(36:41)
Even the New York Times admits that 85% of the middle class got a tax cut.
(36:46)
Americans will face a hike tax foundation, finding that a couple with two kids making $165,000 a year would have to pay over $2,400 more in taxes.
(36:58)
And on day one, I will repeal that tax bill. Joe Biden and I are about to work to get rid of that tax cut. Joe and I are about to get rid of that tax bill. Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax cut.
(37:09)
Everything from a 70 to 80% tax rate.
(37:12)
I think that’s fantastic. We’ve got to increase the corporate tax rate. Part of that is going to be about repealing that tax bill that they just passed. And also looking at estate taxes are going to have to go up. We will tax capital gains.
(37:24)
But we’re going to have to raise corporate taxes.
(37:26)
Taxing unrealized gains just doesn’t seem fair in any sense of the word.
(37:31)
But the value of your home goes up. You pay higher taxes even if you don’t sell your home.
(37:34)
Your value of your home never moves the way stock moves to say, “We’re going to tax what you don’t have.” That’s a sore point and it’s a big deal. Is that something you think she firmly believes in?
(37:45)
I think it’s part of the proposals of the campaign.
(37:46)
And to my plan, there will also be a carbon fee. There has to be some connection between the fee and bad behaviors, and there has to be… And that we have to monitor whether it’s going to be passed on to consumers. But I’m going to tell you that should never be the reason not to actually put a fee, and in particular, carbon fee.
(38:04)
[inaudible 00:38:10]

Donald Trump (38:11):

How about the tax on unrealized gain? That one hasn’t even been tried. That’s a communist tax that hasn’t been very successful, I tell you. Think of it, they want to have a capital gain on unrealized gains. Think of what they’re saying. You’re going to pay a tax on something you haven’t made. These are stupid people, would be driven into a depression like 1929 style depression. For years, Americans have watched as our country has been stripped of our jobs, stripped of our wealth, and seen our companies being sold off to foreign countries. And by the way, I would not approve the US steel deal to Japan. I wouldn’t do it. I wouldn’t do it.
(38:53)
One of the greatest companies in the world. 60 years ago, one of the greatest countries in the world and we have to help it. We have to make it better. We have to be able to make steel. It could happen. You have a war and when you have a war, you need things like army tanks and ships and lots of things that are made of steel. We don’t want to get our steel from China. We don’t want to get our steel… I put a tremendous tariff because China was dumping a lot of bad steel here, bad steel. I call it dirty steel, not good steel. But I put a big tax.
(39:27)
I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China. No other president took in 10 cents and I saved our steel industry by doing it. So I’m very proud of that. But under my plan for the US economy, American workers will no longer be worried about losing their jobs to foreign nations. Instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America because we’re taking them back.
(39:56)
We’re going to bring those companies back and we can do it with intelligent taxing. We can do it. We can do it like they’ve been doing to us for years. It’s very simple and we have the place that people want to be and it’s not going to be that way always. If we keep going like this, nobody is going to want to be here. German car companies can become American car companies. We can beat China in electronic production. Manufacturers that have left us will come roaring back. They’ll come roaring back. This thing has gotten such great reviews. I’m going to explain it. It’s so simple. And some people said, “Wow, that’s unbelievable what you’re doing. Where did you get that idea?” I’m going to go a little forward. I got the idea from, if you want tax benefits, you have to build in America. If you don’t want tax benefits, you don’t have to do. The United States will give you the lowest taxes, the lowest energy cost. We have the most energy. We have more than Saudi Arabia. We have more than Russia. We’re going to give you the lowest energy, the lowest regulatory burdens and free access to the best and biggest market anywhere in the planet, but only if you make your product here in America and hire American workers for the job.
(41:16)
And we don’t do that. There’s this crazy person that you just watched. She gives you a tax benefit if you make your product in another country. These people, it’s so crazy. And if these companies don’t take the deal, they’ll pay a very substantial tariff when they send their products made in another country to us. And we will use the hundreds and billions. It’s really trillions. But we’re going to use the hundreds of billions of tariff dollars to benefit American citizens and to pay off debt because we have to start paying off debt.
(41:59)
And this new American industry will create millions of jobs, massively raise wages for American workers and make the United States a manufacturing powerhouse like it has never been before. We were good, but we can be better than that if we do this. And it’s so simple. And essentially we are doing to them what they’ve done to us. They do it. And some of the worst abusers… I call them abusers of our country are our so- called allies. What they do to us on trade is just incredible. It’s not going to happen any longer.
(42:35)
I guarantee you it’s not. They respected your president four years ago. Now they look at this guy and now they have somebody that’s dumber than he is coming along. It’s not good. It’s not good. And we can’t play games. I’d like to be nice. I want to be nice. I think I’m a nice person. But we can’t take games. We can’t. If we lose this election, this country is finished. I really believe it. This country is finished.
(42:59)
By contrast, the tax queen is demanding a 33% tax hike on all domestic production. You know what’s going to happen? All of those companies, even small businesses, but all of those companies are going to leave our shores. Everybody wants the companies. That’s what they want. It’s very competitive. She even has a plan to tax the unrealized… And we’re going to talk about that. But it is the craziest thing. Never been done, could never be successful.
(43:33)
What it will do is bring you into a wonderful age of our country, 1929 depression. Everybody is going to leave. So if a company succeeds, it must give up much of its value to the government of the United States. Everyone is going to leave. They’re going to take their companies. They’re going to get out. It used to be you moved from state to state and you’d negotiate. Now people are moving their companies to other countries and we’re getting killed, by the way, by Mexico. Mexico is killing us. So just be ready because if I’m president, we’re going to take that back from Mexico. They’re not treating us right.
(44:08)
They’re building massive car plants. They’re building some of the biggest auto plants, car manufacturing plants anywhere in the world. And then they think they’re going to build them cheap and sell them into our country and destroy Michigan and all these wonderful states. So it’s not going to happen. We’ll put a tariff of 200% on if we have to. We’re not going to let it happen. We’re not letting those cars come into the United States and destroy our car industry. You won’t have anything left.
(44:37)
You’ve already lost 60% of it. You’ve lost so much over the years. Not when I was there. Kamala Harris already cost the average family $29,000 with rampant inflation. The inflation that we’ve suffered for the last four years now. It’s almost four years. It’s coming back. And look, we’re not going to let this happen either. And the price, they talk about more than anything else, groceries. Who would think groceries? It’s so bad they go to the supermarket. Who would think it could happen? Our plan would raise taxes on 4.1 trillion. We’re going to be raising them by 4.1 trillion in taxes. Hiking the family’s taxes by 2,600 to $3,200 a year, reducing our GDP by 2%, lowering wages by 1.2 and killing 786, 000 full-time jobs. And I don’t know if you know, last month we lost 26,000 manufacturing jobs in the US, 26,000 because people want to get the hell out of here.
(45:44)
The market goes up every time I get a good poll number and we have had great ones now. The market is starting to go and they get the credit for it. Isn’t that a terrible thing? I said, “Do me a favor, just sort of…” Every time we… Literally, we have some of the biggest analysts, the best analysts in the world. They’re saying every time Trump has good publicity, the market goes up.
(46:04)
Kamala is right now shutting down power plants all across the country causing electricity prices to soar. They are soaring. Do you see what’s going on with electricity by more than 100% soaring and driving us into third world status by attacking the entire fossil fuel industry? Just so you know, you need fossil fuel to fire up those big massive plants. The wind isn’t going to do it. It’s wonderful. Isn’t that nice? Look at the little windmill. It’s so beautiful.
(46:38)
We need fossil fuel. They tried it in Germany. Angola was thrown out after about a year, and now they’re building a coal plant a week. I don’t like flies. Get out of here, fly. Never been a big fan of flies. You don’t mind my bringing that up, do you?
(46:59)
Anyway, this is a very aggressive sucker that is, this one. This one in particular is very aggressive. Like I’m going to be aggressive for our country. You can probably say that. If this continues, Wisconsin manufacturing will be dead. You’ll be absolutely dead. And I got you the biggest shipbuilding contract in the country in my last year, right? He’s nodding yes, right? The biggest. And they’ve done a great job. But the biggest. And I took a lot of heat. A lot of people are not in love with me for doing it, but I got it for Wisconsin. And you know that. Actually, you know it from Texas because they wanted it too. I won’t say that too loud. But everybody wanted it and I got it for Wisconsin. And they’re doing a great job. They’re doing a great job.
(47:51)
But the horrific nightmare for American workers ends the day that I take the oath of office. It will end on that day. It’s going to be over. We’re going to have a country that’s going to turn around very fast. The centerpiece of my plan for a manufacturing renaissance will be a 15% made in America corporate tax rate, cutting the business tax from 21 to 15. Okay? So I took it from 39 to 21 with the help of your great congressman over here, Troy, Troy Nehls.
(48:28)
We fought hard, but we took it from 39 to 21. Everyone said, “That’s impossible.” We got it approved by Congress. Can you believe that? And that makes us pretty competitive, because there are many countries. And again, remember the countries, there are sort of our opponents on trade. They’re actually our opponents. And sometimes it’s pretty vicious opponents on trade. But we took it down to 21 from 39. Now I’m taking it from 21 to 15, but only for those who make their product in America, right? Pretty simple.
(49:09)
I got a call from some of the smartest geniuses on Wall Street. They said, “Where did you ever think of that idea?” It sounds simple, right? It’s like the paperclip. They make the paperclip and everyone is saying, “Why didn’t I think of that?” But we will protect those companies moving into America. And this is just as important because you can’t have them. And then everybody comes and steals your company, steals your people, dumps your product. And so this is important.
(49:35)
All of our existing companies are going to be protected with stiff tariffs placed on companies that don’t move in. If they don’t move in, they’re going to have to pay tariffs because we’re not going to let them hurt the companies that do move in. And the only way they can get out of paying those tariffs is to build their plants and factories here in the USA. Anywhere in the USA, in Wisconsin would be nice. But anywhere in the USA. We will also cut energy and electricity prices in half. 50% within 12 months, including for all people and families. Not just companies. So ready? Your energy bill will be cut from January 20th, will be cut by 50% in 12 months. Okay? 5-0, 50%. And I hate to say it with your Democrat governor. You have some of the highest electricity prices and highest energy costs is just about at the top in Wisconsin. You have some of the highest costs. You do have a lousy governor. I do hear just one thing about him. He doesn’t work hard. That’s the only thing I hear about him. How does he do? He doesn’t even show up. That’s no good. No, he’s a lousy governor.
(51:05)
I guess they’ll work on that next cycle, but he’s not a good governor. We will quickly double our electric capacity. AI is the new big thing, whatever. But AI is the big thing. But AI to do it successfully and to be the leader because China is already starting and very big, we need double the electricity. For whatever reason, they need massive electricity. We need double the electricity that we have right now. Who would think that? So what we have right now, you need doubled, and we will get that done.
(51:37)
We’ll have to do something with respect to the environment because under the environmental impact statements right now, it would take you 20 years to build anything having to do with electric or anything, any form of energy. We’re going to do an expedited plan where it’ll be done in a matter of weeks or months. We got to get it. We’ve got to get it done. We cannot do these impact statements that take years and years and years. People are working on a project. They start off as young men and women, and by the time they’re old and retired, the project gets rejected. They actually get rejected. They work on it for 20, 25 years, and then it gets rejected.
(52:15)
We’re not going to have that because it’s really a way of hurting us. It’s a way of hurting us. We’re not going to do it. We need tremendous electric here so that people like Elon and other people that are into this whole world of… It’s a new world, but it’s going to be a very big world, a very fascinating world, probably a very dangerous world. AI has got some little tricks to it that we have to be very careful with, but they need massive electricity and we’re going to provide it.
(52:43)
We’re going to be able to compete with anybody. We’ll be the leader. We’re going to be the leader in virtually every field. We’re going to be the leader in automobile manufacturing. Think of that. And it’ll happen quickly. And I have pledged to remove 10 old and burdensome regulations. And I did this… We had more regulatory cuts when I was president than any president in history by three times. But we’re going to get rid of burdensome regulations. We’re taking them off the books, and it’s 10 for one. We put in one, we get rid of 10. And it had a great impact.
(53:26)
But I had the most success in history in cutting regulations. I gave you two things. I gave you the biggest tax cut in history, and I gave you the biggest regulation cut in history. Those two things gave us the greatest economy in the history of our country. We had that just a short time ago. So if you want your incomes to plummet, your net worth to collapse, your tax bills to soar, and your jobs to disappear, then vote for Kamala. She’ll do very well. But if you want Washington bureaucrats to keep their greedy hands off of your money and out of your pockets, then you have to vote for Trump. We’re going to get this thing done first. We’ll work together.
(54:19)
So the other thing we’re going to do is we’re going to terminate Kamala’s insane electric vehicle mandate where every car, every car has to be in a very short number of years, all electric. They don’t go far. And by the way, I love electric cars. I think they’re great, but they’re for a certain market. And we want also gasoline-powered cars, and we want hybrids. And the new thing is hydrogen cars. You heard me talking about it. Hydrogen cars is the new thing. It’s got one problem. It’s got one problem. It’s very violent. If it blows up, you are not recognizable. Please come down and identify your husband.
(55:04)
There’s a blood stain on the tree. Can you identify it? No, it’s very violent. Did you know that? It’s dangerous. If it blows up, you’re screwed. Okay, so I’m going to pass on that particular car. They say it has a wonderful future, but the one problem is it’s really dangerous when it blows. Okay? It wipes out people on the street. I mean, it’s terrible. I would actually say they shouldn’t even go too far without one, don’t you think? I don’t know. I think we shouldn’t go too far. But hydrogen is a big new deal.
(55:37)
The other thing we’re going to end is the green new scam. It’s the greatest scam in history. We had the cleanest air and the cleanest water in the history, meaning the recorded history of our country. We had clean air. That’s what I want. I want clean, beautiful water, and I want clean air. And after that, I want jobs and I want success for our country, right? My pro-worker policies are one of the major reasons why I’ve been endorsed by the Rank-and-file membership of the Teamsters. Can you believe that?
(56:11)
We got 60% of the Teamster members members in Wisconsin? Any Teamsters here? Thank you. Any Teamsters? Yes. Thank you very much. That’s very nice because typically Democrats get… And we won nationwide. We won 60% of the Teamsters vote, and we also won a hundred percent of the Fraternal Order of Police. The largest. 400,000. And I do believe that from sheriffs and from law enforcement and from border patrol, and from ICE, from anything having to do with law and order, I think we’re at a hundred percent. We’ve got like everybody, which tells you something, which tells you they don’t like people that were in charge of defund the police.
(56:59)
She was in charge of defund the police. She’s a radical left. She’s further left than crazy Bernie Sanders. Okay, that’s pretty fun. No, she’s considered worse than Pocahontas. She’s worse than Pocahontas. She’s worse than Bernie Sanders. How the hell do you people… Are you… Is anybody… Okay, is there anybody here that’s going to vote for Lying Kamala? Please raise your hand. Please raise your… Actually, I should say, don’t raise your hand. It would be very dangerous. We don’t want to see anybody get hurt. Please don’t raise your head.
(57:39)
As we bring back our jobs, we will also restore America’s borders with four more years of Kamala. Every Wisconsin small town and mid-Western. I mean the Midwestern cities are just devastated by this, will be flooded with illegal migrants from the most dangerous places on earth. And Wisconsin will not be Wisconsin any longer. No state will be, the country won’t be the US any longer. It’s very simple. Your state will be a dumping ground for people that have committed murder, violent crimes, drugs, jail. They’re in jails. And that’s what’s happening. We have 21 million people as borders are.
(58:19)
And they came in from prisons and jails and mental institutions and insane asylums, and a level of terrorism and a level of terrorists that we’ve never seen. I never talked about it when I was president. We didn’t have one terror attack in four years. Think of it. Not one. Think of it. Not one. And I had a lot of people say, “Sir, it’s time. You should say that.” I said, “I don’t want to say it until I’m finished. I don’t want to say it.” I didn’t want to say it. But we didn’t have one terrorist attack in four years. One week ago, I was in the beautiful town of Prairie du Chien. Have you heard of it? Prairie du Chien. In Western Wisconsin, where by the way we had 60,000 people show up. That’s the good news.
(59:12)
But Biden, Sleepy Joe didn’t give us the number of people required. So we ended up speaking in front of a relatively small group. I hope those… We’re going to go back and we’re going to take care of that situation. They didn’t give us the people necessary. So we spoke in front of a rather tiny little portion of them. They stayed around. They were great, but we had 60,000 people there. And I think you’re getting close to that right here too. It’s pretty amazing.
(59:45)
But Prairie du Chien. And last month police arrested an illegal alien member of a savage Venezuelan prison gang. Not a nice person. This vile monster who had prior charges

Donald Trump (01:00:00):

Charges for strangulation, was arrested. He liked strangling people. Other than that, he was quite a nice person. Now, his thing was he liked strangling people, was arrested for holding a mother and daughter captive against their will and sexually assaulting them again and again and again. This animal crossed Kamala’s wide-open border, just walked in, nobody asked anything about him. They knew nothing about him. He was arrested and released in the sanctuary city of Minneapolis, where you have one of the worst vice presidents. Can you imagine that clown, what JD did to him? How about that guy?
(01:00:44)
And he was immediately released by Minnesota and set loose to prey on more victims. And he did earlier this year in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. Fond du Lac, nice. I love these names. I wish they could give me a little easier name [inaudible 01:01:09]. They told me that’s the way you pronounce it. I hope I got it right.

Crowd (01:01:12):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (01:01:14):

But an illegal alien release by Kamala Harris was arrested for tying up and blindfolding a 12-year-old… You know this, you read it, it’s big story… A 12-year-old girl at a back of a van and viciously assaulting her in so many ways, and sexually. Today I make you this promise, I will liberate Wisconsin and our entire nation from this mass migration invasion of murderers, child predators, drug dealers, gang members and thugs. It’ll be liberated. It’ll liberate. It’s incredible. It would be just incredible.

Crowd (01:01:57):

Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump.

Donald Trump (01:02:04):

Thank you. It’s so sad we even have to talk about it. Who would even think we have to talk about it really? And I think they’d say the biggest topic is the economy. The biggest topic is inflation, and then the third topic is the border. I really don’t agree. I think the biggest topic might be the border-

Crowd (01:02:19):

Yes.

Donald Trump (01:02:19):

Because I just think we’ll solve the problems and we’re going to drill, we’re going to get your energy down, the energy’s going to bring everything else down. We’re going to get the interest rates down. I was 2% in my administration, now they’re 10% and you can’t get any money. That’s killing the American dream for young people. So we’re going to get it down.
(01:02:39)
But to me, I know they do all these polls and the polls say it’s the economy. And the polls say very strongly it’s inflation, and I can understand it a little bit. To me, it’s the horrible people that we’re allowing into our country that are destroying our country. And it’s the hardest problem to solve too. It’s a big, tremendous problem. And that they could do this to our country, putting, again, 13,000 murderers, many of them murdering many people, many of them or a certain number of them, a fixed number, but in death row, they were going to be executed. And rather than executing, they said, “Let’s go. We’ll dump them into America. They’re stupid there. They’ll accept them.” 13,099 people, drug dealers at a level that nobody’s ever seen. Terrorists from different countries all over the world. This is no longer South America, this is all over the world. And they come from the Congo. The Congo in Africa, I don’t know what it is, but large numbers of people are coming in from the Congo and you know where they’re coming from? The jails of the Congo.
(01:03:48)
What’s happening is-

Speaker 6 (01:03:49):

Mr. Trump, we love you.

Donald Trump (01:03:50):

These dictators are taking their jails and they’re emptying their jails into the United States, and crime in Venezuela is down 72%. Crime all over the world is down now because they’re putting their criminals, they’re putting their jailed people, they’re putting their drug dealers, they’re bringing them into the United States of America and they’re dumping them and they say, “Don’t come back, and if you do come back, we’re going to kill you.” And we’re stuck with them. We’re not going to be stuck with them. We’re going to be bringing them back and we’re going to shove them right down their throat. They should have never been allowed to be here. Unbelievable. It’s unbelievable. It is unbelievable. Thank you.
(01:04:45)
And we’re not allowing these people to invade us, to conquer us. Did you see what they’re doing in Colorado, where you have a very weak governor, he’s very weak? He’s a liberal guy and very weak, and they’ve attacked Aurora. Venezuela gangs, young guys, they have weapons like our military has, the equivalent of our military, and they’ve taken over buildings in Aurora, Colorado. And the governor, he doesn’t know what to do because he wants to be nice because he’s stupid and he doesn’t really know what to do. I think they need a new governor. On day one of my new administration, the invasion of savage criminals ends. And on that same day, the largest deportation in American history begins, going to begin. The largest deportation. And I’m not happy to say that. I’m not happy. It should have not been necessary. This has all happened over the last almost four years now. It shouldn’t be necessary. We had the safest border in the history of our country.
(01:05:53)
Oh, my favorite chart in history. Bring down that chart please. I don’t know if you have it. If you have it, bring it down. I love it. I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for immigration. I wouldn’t be here, Troy. I looked over at that chart and ping. If I didn’t… It’s amazing. That chart is very… I kiss it every night. I take it to bed with me every single night. No, I turned over to look at the chart, at the beginning, not the end, it’s always on the left. It’s never on the right. And just one day it was on the right, and if I didn’t turn my head, somebody would be here, but I guarantee you they’d have a hell of a lot less people. You’d have about three people in the front, but for all of that… But take a look at that. When you look at that chart, see the arrow on the bottom? That’s the lowest number of immigration we’ve ever had in our country in recorded history. And look what these stupid people allowed to happen to our country.
(01:07:01)
That was the day I left office right there. That was the day, the red arrow. Look what happened. And all they had to do is leave what I had. I had a policy, remain in Mexico, you have to remain in Mexico until you get checked out. And not a lot of people got checked out. Some very bad people were coming and they wouldn’t get in. They couldn’t get in. We built hundreds of miles of wall and boy did it work. And then they could have thrown up… We had 200 miles that we were still putting up. We were 500 and some odd miles of wall, a lot of wall, and it was working. We used the Mexican government, they paid a fortune.
(01:07:37)
The Mexican government gave us 28,000 soldiers to protect our border because I said, “They’re coming through your country, you’re going to do it.” They said, “No, I’m not.” To the president of Mexico, who I got along with great, but he said, “I won’t do that.” I said, “Yes you will. You’re going to do it. They’re coming through your country and you’re going to do it.” They said, “No, we won’t do that, President. We won’t do it.” I said, “Yes you will.” And I said, “I guarantee you will.” And they started saying, “What the hell does this guy have in mind?” And I said, “If you don’t do it, I’m going to put 100% tariffs on your cars and all other things you send into the United States and we’ll make so much money, we’ll be able to hire all the security we want.” And they said, “Mr. President, we’ve decided that we would love to do it. We would love to do it.”
(01:08:24)
They paid a big price. Mexico paid a lot of money toward our wall, let me tell you. They gave us great security, they had a lot of soldiers, thousands and thousands of soldiers. I said, “Free of charge.” I didn’t reimburse them. And then, when these clowns took over, think of it, remain in Mexico, catch and release. So we had catch and release in the United States. We made a minor change. We catch and release in Mexico. That’s a big difference. Would you say that’s a difference? That’s a big difference. So we did all these things, but that was the lowest number in the history of our country. And all they had to do is leave it.
(01:09:04)
Guys like Tom Homan, Brandon Judd, you have people now at the border patrol that are phenomenal. Phenomenal. And they want to do the job and they’re not being allowed to do the job. And then they made this minor change a couple of months ago to try and make the numbers look better. But what they didn’t tell you is they’re still flying thousands of people overhead and that’s not reported. And they have an app. And the app for is the cartel heads. They call an app so that we can tell them where to drop the criminals. Can you believe it? They have an app.

Crowd (01:09:36):

Boo.

Donald Trump (01:09:36):

So they have the plane and they have the app. And that’s not included in the numbers. Just like 818,000 phony job numbers. I call them fraudulent numbers, 818,000 job numbers, they defrauded. They said there were 818,000 jobs and they reported it and they were going to un-report it and correct it right after the election. But we had a great whistleblower who rang it out on them, 818,000 jobs were reported fraudulently to make their numbers look better. These are bad people that we’re dealing with, so you have to get out and you have to vote.
(01:10:16)
You also need to vote for the next senator. And I mentioned him and he’s great. He’s strong, he’s powerful. If he wants, he can come up or he can just sit the hell down because you’re going to vote for him anyway, I got to… But Eric Hovde is running to defeat radical left Tammy Baldwin. You want to come up fast? Come on, Eric. We got to get this guy elected. Come on, you want to come up? Come on up. Come on up. Now he’s a little nervous about coming up. He said, “That was the worst invitation I’ve ever had.” Come on up, Eric. He’s great. Know he just said, “Do you want me up? That was the worst invitation I’ve ever had.” Come here. Say a few words, Eric.

Eric Hovde (01:11:10):

I always love being here with President Trump. Let’s give a round of applause. President Trump, I was talking to the folks beforehand, in business, results matter. You got to get a deal done, you got to make money. You’ve built one of the most successful careers, biggest developer. I’ve spent my life in the private sector building businesses. We’re going to get this country moving. President Trump gave you wage increases of 7.7%, a record for America. That’s results. The world had no wars. That’s results. Our communities were safe because he had the border closed and he stood by law enforcement. That is results. Senator Baldwin, Kamala Harris, they’re career politicians that have never accomplished anything and have failed at everything. So all of you, go work hard, go grab every friend, colleague, neighbor, and let’s restore this great country and get President Trump and me to Washington. Let’s go folks.

Donald Trump (01:13:20):

Thank you very much, Eric. He’s a great guy. He is a very, very successful guy. He’s strong. It’s what you need. Tammy Baldwin does nothing. She does nothing for you. Nothing. And we’re also delighted to be joined by a friend of mine. He’s a great senator and he’s done a really good job but he loves your state, Senator Ron Johnson. Ron. [inaudible 01:13:45]. You want to come up? We have plenty of time. It’s a Sunday, right?

Ron Johnson (01:14:07):

Thank you, Mr. President. Thank all of you for coming. On behalf of the hundreds and literally thousands of Wisconsinites that I’ve talked to over the last few months that want to convey to you their appreciation, oftentimes with tears in their eyes, they want to thank you for your courage, for your tenacity, for your love of this country, for your willingness. They realize you didn’t have to do this, but you’re willing to do it because, like them, you love this country fervently. So, on behalf of all those Wisconsinites, I want to say thank you, thank you. Thank you.

Crowd (01:14:51):

USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.

Ron Johnson (01:14:51):

USA.

Crowd (01:14:51):

USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.

Ron Johnson (01:14:54):

I also want to thank you for your new alliance with Bobby Kennedy. Not only is that important so we are actually going to address the huge problem of chronic health and children’s health, but you are right about the enemy within. They are dividing us on purpose. They are destroying this nation. And by aligning with Bobby Kennedy, you are setting the example, the two of you, set the differences aside, focus on an area of agreement on a big problem. And in doing so, you are demonstrating exactly how this nation can come together, how we heal and unify America. So God bless you, God protect you, and God bless America. Thank you. [inaudible 01:16:08].

Donald Trump (01:16:04):

[inaudible 01:16:20].

Ron Johnson (01:16:04):

[inaudible 01:16:14].

Crowd (01:16:04):

Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump.

Donald Trump (01:16:23):

Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Great, Ron. Thank you. Does a great job.

Crowd (01:16:29):

[inaudible 01:16:32].

Donald Trump (01:16:32):

I’d like to, if I could, just for a second, so you have a young, brilliant congressman and he’s on a committee and it’s a very important committee, and he’s studying fraud and the fraud within the Democrat Party and what they’re doing in terms of campaign contributions. And it’s a tremendous scandal, and I’m afraid the fake news, they’ll probably all turn off the cameras now, but I say, could you just give just a little prelude because I think it’s going to be one of the biggest stories in a long time. Even if they don’t want to cover it, they’ll be forced to cover it. So I’d like to ask Congressman Bryan Steil to come up please.

Bryan Steil (01:17:19):

Isn’t it great to be at a Trump rally?

Crowd (01:17:21):

Yeah.

Bryan Steil (01:17:24):

Do you agree with me, President Trump is going to win Wisconsin in 30 days?

Crowd (01:17:29):

Yeah.

Bryan Steil (01:17:35):

When we drove over here, people were waving signs and holding up Trump signs and we saw a lot of men and women of law enforcement are working to keep you safe, Mr. president. So to all the men and women of law enforcement here, thank you for what you’re doing to keep President Trump safe. Law enforcement’s a lot about keeping us safe and enforcing the laws. And in this election, we want to make sure that people are following the laws. Things like photo ID and US citizens are the only one who should be able to vote in US elections. Don’t you agree?

Crowd (01:18:24):

Yeah.

Bryan Steil (01:18:24):

As chairman of the Committee on House Administration, we began trying to figure out how all these things are operating. And in particular, where’s all the funds coming into the liberal campaigns across the state of Wisconsin running TV ads against President Trump? We looked into ActBlue and we called the into the Committee and we said, “What processes are you using?” And I said, “You’re using a CVV code.” That’s that little three or four digit number on the back of your credit card that you have to use when you buy almost anything online. And we found out they weren’t requiring it if you want to make a donation on ActBlue. Then we started to dig further and we started to find more and more things where they don’t have the financial security in place that they need to. So we did a big review and we’ve transferred it over to a group of Republican attorney generals from across the country. And they’re digging into this information, Mr. Trump. I think they’re going to find a lot of answers very soon for you.
(01:19:23)
So President Trump, thanks for what you’re doing for this country. I think you are going to win, not only Wisconsin, but the presidency in 30 days. And you see this crowd and everyone here, thanks for all you’re doing. God bless you. God bless you, President Trump.

Donald Trump (01:19:42):

Thank you. Thank you, Bryan. Also with us are members of Congress, great ones. Scott Fitzgerald. What a nice name that is. That’s a good name. Where’s Scott? I love that name, Scott. Must be a good writer. He’s a great writer. Glenn Grothman. Thank you, Glenn. Been my friend for a long time. And a man who is not from these parts any longer, he was from here, he grew up here and he loves it so much. He’s from a place called Texas and he’s one of the most popular politicians in Texas. He does a phenomenal job. And he has literally parked himself up here for the last couple of months, and for this last month in particular, but he’s been here with his brother. His brother is a phenomenal guy and they are here for one reason to make sure the election people get out to vote and to make sure it’s honest.
(01:20:56)
And the people of Texas know this, and they love this guy for what he is doing. He said, “I can help.” He’s so popular, he won by a lot of votes, he has no problems at all. But he felt he was better off coming up because, if we win Wisconsin, we win the presidency. We win the presidency. We win the presidency. So I’d like to ask… And he’s just a special guy. He loves this country so much. And I can tell, some guys come up, “Nah, I love the country.” Other guys come up, “I love the country, we have to…” And he’s one of the latter. He’s one of the guys that just loves it.
(01:21:35)
And they love him. They love him so much in Texas, they love him here. But what he wanted to do, because he knows it so well, he’s a part of Wisconsin, he wanted to be here to make sure that we win and to make sure that it’s as honest as we can get it. Because they’re going to cheat. They cheat. That’s all they want to do is cheat. And when you see this, it’s the only way they’re going to win. And we can’t let that happen. And we can’t let it happen again. We’re going to have no country. So I’d like to ask a very special man and a friend of mine, Troy Nehls, to come up with his brothers, Trevor, Tim and Todd. Please come up.

Troy Nehls (01:22:11):

Thank you.

Speaker 1 (01:22:11):

Let’s go. Let’s go.

Troy Nehls (01:22:47):

Mr. President, what an honor and a privilege is to be up here with my brothers. We are honored to be with you. Look at the thousands of people out here that love you. They’re here. This is America. This is the heart and soul of America, the blue collar, the farmers, they’re all here for you, sir. They’re here for you because they love you and they think you’re great. I’ve been planning on this thing, I’ve been reaching to the team. I said, “Sir, we got to have a rally in Wisconsin. We can win Wisconsin.” We keep looking and we keep looking, gets canceled, this and that. And then, all of a sudden, I get a call last Tuesday, “Hey Congressman, you think Sunday would work?” What the hell kind of time are you giving us on Sunday to get out?
(01:23:38)
But look at everybody’s here. Everybody came. Everybody came because they know how important this election is. You know it. Mr. president, I can assure you this, the passion in this state, they love you. We have been up here for weeks going to county fairs, we see the passion. We see the love. We see the energy. And sir, I can assure you, everybody here is going to get their family, their friends, we are going to win Wisconsin and Donald Trump is going to make America great again. He’s going to do it. He’s going to do it.

Speaker 1 (01:24:20):

Fight, fight, fight.

Troy Nehls (01:24:20):

Thank you. You’re a star.

Speaker 2 (01:24:20):

Thank you, Mr. President.

Troy Nehls (01:24:20):

Good job.

Donald Trump (01:24:22):

Thank you. It’s an honor to have you up here.

Troy Nehls (01:24:29):

Thank you.

Donald Trump (01:24:36):

Thanks, Troy. Well, I’ve never seen it before. And his district is so happy he’s doing it, he explained it to them, “What do you want to do?” They love that he’s doing it and we really appreciate it. And we’re leading Texas by a lot. We’re leading Texas. So he said, “I want to come up here because this is a big deal. Wisconsin is a big deal.” Thank you. And he knows it so well. They grew up here. Thanks. Former US, Senator Bob Kasten. Bob, thank you very much. Bob. Nice to see you, Bob.

Bob Kasten (01:25:07):

You too.

Donald Trump (01:25:10):

You look good. And Dodge County Sheriff, Dale Schmidt, who by the way is here with a group of Wisconsin sheriffs announcing that they are endorsing Trump. We love him. Come on up here, sheriff. [inaudible 01:25:40].

Dale Schmidt (01:25:24):

Mr. President, thank you. [inaudible 01:26:33].

Donald Trump (01:25:24):

Oh, yes please.

Speaker 7 (01:25:24):

Come on, Dale.

Dale Schmidt (01:25:24):

[inaudible 01:26:33]?

Donald Trump (01:25:24):

Oh, yes, please.

Dale Schmidt (01:26:42):

You’re here for him, not me. Mr. President, I am proud to announce that all of these sheriffs are among a very small amount of sheriffs and law enforcement across our country that support you. I’d say 80 to 90% of law enforcement across this country are behind you, Mr. President. I have something very important I think you’re going to want to hear. In Dodge County, in this 2024 election, there are zero drop boxes for the election.

Donald Trump (01:27:22):

[inaudible 01:27:33].

Dale Schmidt (01:27:33):

Our clerks are fantastic. We’re going to make sure that we have the best, most secure election in Dodge County history. And one last thing, Mr. President, the last time I met you, I was with 200 sheriffs standing on the South Lawn, and you came out and you shook a bunch of sheriffs’ hands and you didn’t quite get to me.

Crowd (01:27:55):

Aw.

Dale Schmidt (01:27:55):

Wait. So I did one thing that I knew would get his attention and he’ll do again here shortly as soon as I say it, I shouted and he walked over to me afterwards. Best president ever.

Donald Trump (01:28:08):

[inaudible 01:28:09].

Dale Schmidt (01:28:08):

Thank you.

Speaker 3 (01:28:08):

USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.

Donald Trump (01:28:09):

Thank you so much. Go get ’em. I love no lock boxes, sir. Thank you. Thank you very much. You take care. This is a great honor. These are great, great men. And there’s nobody that respects them more than this group. They do such a job, and generally law enforcement in our country. And, oh and woman. Come here. Hi. Gee. She’s the best one up here, I think, right, sheriff?

Speaker 5 (01:28:58):

You bet.

Donald Trump (01:29:04):

Thank you. That’s good. Thank you very much. But I appreciate it so much, and the endorsement means a lot to me. And anything you need, I’m here. Thank you very much. Thank you, sheriff.

Dale Schmidt (01:29:10):

Thank you, Mr. President.

Donald Trump (01:29:10):

Thank you, Sheriff.

Dale Schmidt (01:29:10):

Thank you.

Donald Trump (01:29:39):

These are great people. Wow, what a group. Thank you, sheriffs. Thank you. No, we have a lot of law enforcement here today, and I just want say to all of the people in

Donald Trump (01:30:00):

… Johnson and law enforcement officers, all of them that are here today, we have so many, I will give you my total support, resources, power, protection, and respect. You are going to do your job because that’s what you want to do. You’re the most respected people in our country. I want you to know that. Sometimes you don’t feel that way, but you are. Most respected group. So I really think, and Sheriff, thank you very much. What a group. I was a little concerned. There was a lot of beef up here and I’m wondering about this… I was worried about this platform. I said, “Do you think it’s structurally okay?” I’m in the real estate. And I’m looking at this. It wasn’t looking too good. I had to say, “Come on, let’s go. Get off.” But these are great people and boy, they love your state, they love our country that I can tell you. So thank you very much. That’s a great endorsement. Thank you very much.
(01:30:54)
So the sheriffs will be happy to know that we’re going to end sanctuary cities. We will never defund our police and we will make Wisconsin safe again. They’re going to actually do that. They’re going to make Wisconsin very safe and they’ve kept it safe anyway. They only know how to keep it safe. That’s all they want to do. I want to thank you. They’re great. Kamala Harris is the worst Vice President in the history of our country. A radical-left Marxist who was rated far worse than anybody else in the Senate. And here are the facts. She wants to very simply… And they always go back to their origin. If you go back to me, you’ll see, I don’t think I’ve changed at all. They comment like 30 years ago when I wasn’t in politics. I’ve only been doing this actually for a short while. A senator came up to me, “Sir, I’ve been doing this for 30 years. I know what I’m doing.” I said, “Yeah, I’ve been doing it for about eight and we became President.”
(01:31:56)
He’s a man that wanted to run for president, but it never worked out. And if you knew him like I did, it will never work out. But Kamala Harris wants open borders. She will deliver even more catastrophic inflation. She was an original creator, Sheriff, of defund the police movement. What do you think? Is she reformable? Sheriff, is she reformable? She was in charge of defund the police. Do you think she’s fully reformed? I don’t think so. I don’t think so. And anybody who wants to defund the police for even a week or for even a day is not worthy of being President of the United States. Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE. These are great people, these are great patriots. They’re tough cookies too. They would go into a pack of MS13 gang members and their fists would fly. I don’t know somebody has to do that job. I don’t see anybody up here. I have a couple of friends. I don’t see them doing that particular job. They’re good at other things, but not that.
(01:33:02)
But these are great people and she wants to defund them. She wants to get rid of them. She wants to take ICE out. These are the people that remove the worst criminals, the worst gang members, the worst drug dealers from out of our country. Get them the hell out of here and she wants to get rid of him. She wants mass amnesty and citizenship for all illegals. And she says that we must not utter the words illegal alien or radical Islamic terrorists. She lost more than… To me, statistically this is the worst. In less than four years, she lost more than 325,000 migrant children that are now dead, in sex slavery, in slavery, or just plain missing. As California Attorney General, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon or rape of an unconscious person as totally nonviolent crimes.
(01:34:03)
She praised the idea of a 70 to 80% tax rate. She thought that was very good. She pledged to abolish private healthcare for… Some people want private healthcare, they have to pay for it, but they maybe don’t want to wait in line for six months and force everyone into socialist government-run healthcare, which is what you have to do. They wait on line for months and months and they take a routine or a minor illness and they end up being terminally ill. And by the way, what we did for the military with that, we gave choice and we also did something that was very important. We got rid of 9,000 sadists and bad people from our Veterans Administration and we got rid of them. They hated our soldiers, they hated our heroes.
(01:34:55)
We got rid of and replaced them with people that love our people. That’s what we want. Love our country and love our people. The other thing we did, which is very important, this choice because our veterans were waiting in line. We had a 92% approval rating with our vet. Now it’s down into the forties and they’re getting rid of a lot of the things we did for our vets. We had choice where if you had to wait more than a day for a doctor, a day and a half at the most, you go outside, you get a local doctor, we pay the bill, you get yourself fixed up. This never happened before with our vets and it was unbelievable. And slowly but surely, they’re going to dismantle that. They’ve already started dismantling that. It was one of the best things I was most proud of and we’re going to get it back very fast, you vets. We’re going to get it back very fast.
(01:35:46)
People would be waiting in line for months. They’d say you have to come back in three and a half months and whatever the condition. Can you imagine that when you’re told you can’t even see a doctor for three and a half, half, four months longer than that? And the VA has some great doctors, but the management of getting to see them was very peculiar. So we’re going to take care of that. But we did something. They’ve been trying to get that for 58 years and I got it done, totally done and nothing worked better. And again, 92% approval rating. It was rarely in the forties. So I was very proud of it and we’ll redo it again. We’ll redo it fast. I know exactly what to do and we’re going to redo it. We’re going to take care of our veterans and I think everybody wants that. And as people have been hearing and not believing, but it’s true, she even endorsed free sex exchanges for illegal aliens in detention at taxpayer expense. So if you’re an illegal alien and you’re in detention and you decide that you would like to go from a man to a woman, we give you an operation. Not only is the concept bad, but it’s an unbelievably expensive procedure and we’re supposed to pay for it. This is what she wants and she wants to do it and she hasn’t declined that yet. It’s hard for them to decline everything. So normally if somebody changes one policy, they’re out of business. Right, Troy? She’s changed 15 policies from fracking to everything to that and nobody believes her. And if she ever won, as soon as that would happen, you’re going to be a whole different country. You will see things and I don’t even believe she’s calling the shots.
(01:37:32)
There are some very bad and vicious people that surround her that call the shots. He says the vehicle. Just like Biden was a vehicle. He has no idea what the hell he’s doing. And you saw that. You saw that. Think of it. He has no idea. He couldn’t answer any questions and she can’t do anything. She can’t do anything. She doesn’t want to talk because she’s just a vehicle for very bad people that surround her. Two days ago, Joe Biden shuffled into the White House press room and made the most powerful case against Kamala Harris because she’s trying to disassociate herself from Crooked Joe Biden. What do you like better? It Crooked Joe or Sleepy Joe? Depends. When he is sleeping on the beach, I like Sleepy Joe. When he is in the White House, I like Crooked Joe because he’s the most crooked president we’ve ever had. But right now I think Sleepy because they took the presidency away from him. They had a coup. They staged a minor coup if you haven’t heard, but she is trying to disassociate…
(01:38:34)
She doesn’t even know who the hell he is anymore. She doesn’t mention his name. She doesn’t mention how bad inflation was, how bad. The 325,000 children that we just mentioned. All of these things are so bad. How bad the economy is, how bad the border is. To me, again, the border, the border, it’s always the border. I won in 2016 because of the border. I did a phenomenal job. Is that right, Troy? You were a beneficiary in Texas and I did such a great job. And then in 2020 when I ran, got more votes and everything, but I wanted to talk about the border, my people said, “Sir, nobody wants to talk about the border anymore. You fixed it.” I said, “That’s why I want to talk about it.” I couldn’t talk about it. I said I want to talk. People weren’t interested in it, but that border in 2016 was nothing compared to what you have today.
(01:39:22)
What you have today is a sick group of people that are letting these really bad, dangerous people into our country and we’re going to close that up on day one. My first order is going to be close the border. And they could do that too. They could do that too. Biden could do that right now. He could get up and say close the border and they do it because the President has that power. He doesn’t need bills. They keep talking about bills. The bill they’re talking about was the stupidest bill I’ve ever seen, but they don’t need bills. All the President has to do is say close the border and he has refused to do it. Biden said that he and Kamala were, “Singing from the same song sheet.” She helped pass all the laws, every single one of them. She was a major player in everything we did. Now he went up into the White House, Press Secretary’s lectern, and he said this stuff and they were dying.
(01:40:24)
They were saying, “Oh my God, it’s coming down.” And because you know what? He got tired of hearing that she had nothing to do with anything and he knew it was a lie. So he couldn’t take it any longer and he went up and made a fool out of himself, but you’d expect that. But he said this… This was one hell of a press… This was the worst press conference. They’re screaming at him. He didn’t know what the hell was happening. But the reason he went up there was to make that statement that she knew everything. She could not disassociate herself. She approved everything. She was the vote in the Senate as the Vice President for many of these bills. So a vote for Kamala is a vote for four more years of Crooked Joe Biden. It’s a disaster. It’s a disaster for our country and it’ll never be this way. A vote for Trump is a vote for change and it’s a vote for saving our country. It’s unbelievable.
(01:41:26)
So just in sort of closing up, if Kamala enacts her agenda, she’ll destroy America. Our agenda will make America safer and wealthier than ever before. Remember this something that I think is very important for different people. We will have no tax or tips. Now that doesn’t help the sheriffs too much. That’s not going to help you guys. They never got a tip. I guarantee you that. But that helps a lot of people. But no tax on tips. Then she copied us. Two months later she said, “I’ve got a major announcement. There will be no tax.” But she never even said it again after that. No, but the difference is we get it done. They talked about education and they talked about the debt for students, student debt and they failed on it. They failed on everything.
(01:42:27)
The student debt. A lot of people didn’t like it, but regardless they said it. They kept saying it, saying it. They kept losing, losing, losing. And now it’s a dead deal. It would be that way with these. No tax on tips, ready? No tax on overtime, if you work overtime. And you have a lot of overtime people here, you have a lot of people that work a lot of overtime. I used to hate to pay overtime, Troy. Oh, I used to hate to pay overtime. I did everything I could to get out of it. But you know what? Just a big deal and I actually think that’s going to be a benefit to our economy, an overall benefit. So it’s no tax on tips, no tax on overtime. And are there any seniors in this particular place? I refuse to raise my hand. Okay, I’ll raise. No tax. And this is big because you’ve been destroyed with your fixed incomes. You’ve been destroyed by inflation. No tax on social security for our seniors, no tax for our seniors.
(01:43:34)
That’s a big one. And I’ll get them done fast. I’ll get them done fast. We’ve got people already working on it. We’ll get them all done fast. We’re working and Americans catch up. We’re going to put a temporary cap on the credit card interest rates. Look, right now people are paying 24%, they’re getting killed. We have people with electricity and their bills. They’re behind. 26% of our country is behind on paying their electric bills. We can’t let them pay 22, 24, 26% interest. He just said 30. Are you paying 30, sir? Let me see who you are. He’s dealing with Alphonse Capone as his lender. One of those nice lenders. So we’re putting a cap of 10% temporary cap until we get past this terrible period that we’re living in.
(01:44:27)
I can do that quickly. We will become energy-independent and then energy-dominant like no country has ever seen before because my second order… Number one, close the border. We’re going to get them out of here. Close the border. What’s number two? Drill, baby drill. We will open ANWR in Alaska, the largest drilling site perhaps in the entire world. Can you imagine? Ronald Reagan couldn’t get it. Nobody could get it. They’ve been trying for years and decades and nobody could get it. I got it done and they were all set to take… This is a site that would supply all of Asia. We would make a fortune, we’d pay down our debt and Biden comes in and he terminates it. Nobody could get it done. Ronald Reagan, it was his number one thing he wanted to get done and it’s much tougher to get it done today than it was many years ago. I can tell you that.
(01:45:24)
They use the environment they use anything they can use, but we’re going to tap the liquid gold. Look, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country in the world. We’re going to start using our liquid gold instead of letting it sit there as we buy tar from Venezuela and other places. And we will always protect your social security and your Medicare. We’re not going to have any cuts. And I’ll tell you, we’re never raising the age. She’s going to raise the age on social security by five years. We are not raising the age on social security and we didn’t for four years. We proved it. They’re going to raise it because they’re letting so many people on that shouldn’t be there. I will settle the war in Ukraine. I will end the chaos in the Middle East and I will prevent World War III. I’m going to prevent.
(01:46:20)
Thank you. Thank you very much. And days ago, I was honored to receive the endorsement of many, many people over but far over 300 national security officials. They worked with me. The whole group got together. They endorsed me like they’ve never endorsed anybody before. Even some of the people that you sort of see were against me. They were in that list. They endorsed me and some of them got a lot of money for a book. They said, “No, Trump is great. Trump is great. Well, we’re going to pay you 2 million for a book. Well, he was okay.” You got to say bad. We’re not giving you any money unless you say bad. That’s what happens. But that’s okay. But over 300, did you know, Troy? The biggest guys in the country, over 300 people that worked with us endorsed me, which is a record and I’m very proud of it. Thank you very much.
(01:47:14)
We call that peace through strength and they believed in it too. Peace through strength. I will support universal school choice. Very important. We will let federal education dollars follow the child instead of a propping up of a woke federal bureaucracy and I can’t even believe I have to say this. I will defend parental rights. Can you believe it? Who would believe you had to say that? Can you imagine 10 years having to say that? You’d be embarrassed to have to say it, but we will protect the parents. I won’t investigate parents at schools and school boards. These school boards have dominated this administration. I’ve never seen anything like it. The parents are arrested. The FBI goes after them. We will protect parents. We will protect parental rights. It’s very, very important. I’m going to be listening to the parents. I’m listening to the parents.
(01:48:18)
We will rebuild our cities including Washington DC, making them safe, clean, and beautiful again, and especially safe because of people like that. And we will keep the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. It’s under tremendous threat. Somebody said, “Well, how are you going to do that?” One of these stupid people that ask questions. I said, “I’ll tell you what I’m going to do. If a country wants to leave us and they want to not just consider us the world’s currency, we have to be careful with it too. We have to cherish it and take care of it. But it’s very important. It’d be like losing a war.” If somebody says from a country we’re going to pull out of the reserve currency, I will say the following, “That’s okay, but I’m going to charge you a 200% tariff on all the business you do in the United States of America. And it goes into effect today.” And they will look at me and they will say, “Sir, we have decided to stay in the reserve currency. Sir, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.”
(01:49:29)
Troy can tell you this. There are some people that say, “We love Trump’s policy, but we don’t like Trump.” And I say, “No, no.” Because I actually think I’m a nice person. All I want to do is save our country. Okay? So I just want to save. Then a couple of our senators said, “Here’s the problem. You like his policy, but his policy only works with him.” Because like what I just told you, how many people would say to the head of a country that when Macron, nice guy, Emmanuel from France, he said he’s going to tax American companies at a very high rate. Higher than other companies. And I said to Mnuchin, “And some people don’t let him do it. Go tell him you’re not going to do it and if he does it, he’s going to have a problem.” They went and they came back and they said, “Sir, we haven’t been successful.” I said, “Go do it again. And after that, I’ll take it.” And they did it again and they were unsuccessful.
(01:50:44)
They came to me, they said, “No, he’s going to tax American companies.” Now this is France. They’re going to tax American companies at a very high rate, very few others but American companies. And I said, “Get him on the phone.” I got him on the phone. “Emmanuel, how are you?” “Oh, Donald, Donald, I am fine. Thank you so much.” I said, “Emmanuel, I understand that you’re going to put a very big tax on American companies.” Now as your President, I have to protect American companies. I can’t let that happen. And other companies and other countries aren’t going to be taxed. Like hell that’s going to happen. So I said, “I understand that’s going to happen, Emmanuel.” “Yes, Donald. It is already passed,” by essentially their legislature. I said, “No, Emmanuel. You’re not going to do that.” “Yes, Donald, it’s too late. I’m so sorry, President. I’m so sorry.”
(01:51:33)
I said, “It’s not too late. Not too late. Because if you do that, I’m going to put a 100% tariff on every bottle of wine and every bottle of champagne that you send into the United States of America. One-hundred percent.” And he said, “That’s not fair. That’s not fair.” I said, “Listen, it’s not fair that you’re taxing our companies more than other countries companies. So to me, it’s very fair.” I told him, and I was very late. I think I was probably working on one of the hoaxes or something that keeps you busy. The Democrats scams and hoaxes. I said, “Emmanuel, I don’t have time. I’m giving you five minutes to call me. If you will, please call me back within five minutes. Let me know it because I’m ready to sign this tax.” “I will call back.” He called back in about two minutes. He said, “Donald, I have decided that we will not charge this tax on American companies.” “Thank you, Emmanuel, very much. See you soon. Bye.”
(01:52:39)
I did so much of that. I kept us out of wars. Remember with Trump, you had no wars. Remember crazy Hillary? She said, “Look at him. Look at him. Look at his attitude. He’s going to cause wars.” And I said, “No, my attitude is going to keep us out of wars.” And I was right, except I finished off ISIS. We finished off ISIS. 100% of the ISIS Caliphate was going to take five years. I did it in one month. It was done. No wars. First time in 81 years, I started no wars. But this is how we will end the era of inflation and mayhem and misery under Kamala and Crooked Joe. He’s crooked is a $4 bill. I used to say a $2 bill, but I see $2 bills around, so I can’t say that. And unleash safety, prosperity, and peace for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed, every one of them. Together we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates and low inflation so that everyone can afford groceries, a nice car and a home. The basics. We will stop the invasion. We will end migrant crime. We will strengthen our military. We will build a missile defense shield around our country. Much of it will be made in Wisconsin, by the way. We will keep critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools. It’s God. And we will keep men out of women’s sports. We will defend the Second Amendment, protect religious liberty, restore free speech, and we will once and for all secure our elections. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope, and especially for the people of Wisconsin. You’re going to be happy. You’re going to be happy. But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and we must stop her country-destroying radical left agenda once and for all. We have to knock it. We want a landslide that’s too big to rig. We want a too big to rig.
(01:55:28)
And just finally, after all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years of the history of our country. I believe they’re going to be the four greatest years. Not just a fixing up. It’s going to be a going forward. With your help from now until election day, 30 days, we will redeem America’s promise. We will put America first and we will take back the nation that we love. November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country. And together we will make America powerful again. Powerful. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Wisconsin. Thank you. God bless you. God bless you. Thank you.

Lee, thank you very much, really, and thank you, a very big thank you to Pennsylvania, we love Pennsylvania. And as I was saying… Oh, I love that chart, I love that graph. Isn’t it a beautiful thing? But also beautiful because look at the number, that’s the day I left office, it was the lowest border patrol, the lowest it’s ever been. Illegal immigration, today it’s out of control, but I love it for other reasons too, you know that. So thank you very much and thank Lee, and what Lee has done with that song, and it’s such an honor to have it. I want to just let you know that tonight I returned to Butler in the aftermath of tragedy and heartache to deliver a simple message to the people of Pennsylvania and to the people of America.
(03:50)
Our movement to make America great again, stand stronger, prouder, more united, more determined, and nearer to victory than ever before. We’re going to make America great again, going to win the election, going to win the election. And to all Americans, whether you are a Republican, Democrat, Independent, Conservative, or Liberal, or you have no label whatsoever, it makes no difference, our movement, it belongs to you, it belongs to our country, it belongs to our country. And together in just one month, we are going to usher in a new golden age of American security, prosperity, sovereignty, and freedom for our citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.
(04:40)
Exactly 12 weeks ago this evening, on this very ground, a cold-blooded assassin aimed to silence me and to silence the greatest movement, MAGA, in the history of our country, MAGA. We love MAGA. For 16 harrowing seconds during the gunfire, time stopped as this vicious monster unleashed pure evil from his sniper’s perch, not so far away, but by the hand of providence and the grace of God, that villain did not succeed in his goal, did not come close. He did not stop our movement, he did not break out our spirit. He did not shake our unyielding resolve to save America from evils of poverty, hatred, and destruction. Yet we are here this evening in record numbers, this is a big crowd, this is a big one. This is a big one. Not only to mark the triumph of American spirit but over, and you know that, this is really truly in the truest sense, spirit over evil and adversity, but also to pay tribute to some of the best and bravest we have ever known.
(06:01)
This field is now a monument to the valor of our first responders, to the resilience of our fellow citizens, and to the sacrifice of a loving and devoted father, a really great man, you know that. Forever afterward…

Speaker 1 (06:20):

Corey, Corey, Corey, Corey, Corey, Corey, Corey, Corey, Corey, Corey, Corey, Corey, Corey, Corey, Corey, Corey, Corey…

Donald Trump (06:39):

Forever after, all who have visited this hallowed place will remember what happened here and they will know of the character and courage at so many incredible American Patriots have showed and know, and they know it at a level never seen before probably. First, I want to thank the men and women of the US Secret Service who threw their bodies on top of mine without even a thought for their own lives. They were on top of me so fast, they were on top of me, and there was not even a moment of doubt in their minds. You watch those tapes, not even a moment of doubt, I want to thank Secret Service, great people, they are great people.
(07:25)
And in that moment, those agents displayed a devotion to duty that cannot be described, and they did it yet again, less than three weeks ago when they really did a fantastic job, another attempt, there was another attempt. We have an evil world, we have a very sick world. My gratitude to them is beyond measure. We also owe a tremendous debt thanks to the Secret Service Counter Sniper and a local police sniper who returned fire within seconds and stopped the shooter quickly and saved many lives. If he didn’t stop, he saved many lives, he had a lot of bullets, a lot of ammunition up there with him. And we are… Just amazing when you think they did it so quickly without any knowledge of what was going on, boom. And had that not happened, it would’ve been a very different story, it would’ve been many, many, potentially many, many people.
(08:26)
I also want to express our thanks to the Butler Township Police Department, credible people. The Butler, Sheriff’s deputies, Pennsylvania State Police, and all of the other law enforcement heroes, as well as the emergency personnel and doctors, the medical teams at Butler Memorial Hospital, Allegheny General Hospital, who rushed me and rushed some of these very badly people. They were wounded, a lot of badly wounded people, and in particular, two people, two people. And I tell you, they were very brave and great people, they were big Trump fans and they still are. That means something, that was pretty amazing.
(09:15)
When I got up, I asked whether or not anybody was killed. I assumed that there would be a lot because I heard the bullets winging right over my head. They said probably three, the doctors did such an incredible job. It was one, one great gentleman, but the other two have been amazing actually, they’ve gone through a lot. And when the crisis struck, they did really Pennsylvania proud. You’ve heard that expression, Pennsylvania proud, it’s a great place. I went to school, I went to college in Pennsylvania, it’s a great place, the people are incredible.
(09:53)
Also, and I have to say, after returning to the field, tonight is one of the really brave Americans who was hit by the assassin’s Bullet, US Marine Veteran David Dutch. David, thank you. Thank you David. Thank you David. And David, we’re thrilled to see your recovery is going well. Great doctors up here, I have to tell you, great doctors. Your courage is really an inspiration to us, so I want to thank you very much, David. Great gentleman, great, great gentleman. I want to send our love to someone who could not be here because he has just undergone a major surgery related to the shooting, a man who was really badly wounded like David, James Copenhaver.
(10:49)
Because James was a wonderful man, a big Trump fan, and Mr. Copenhaver is out there watching us right now, but he’s in a hospital where they did some additional work, but he’s in great shape. He wanted to be here so badly, but he’s in great shape and we appreciate it and we’re looking to his full and complete recovery, he will have a complete recovery. Thank you. Thank you very much. And of course there’s one more hero who could not make it back here tonight because he is no longer with us, right? You know who that is, right? Corey, our beautiful Corey. Corey is not with us tonight, and he should be, and we all miss him, he’s become somewhat of a folk hero. I have to tell you who is with us, is his beautiful wife, and daughters, and relatives, sister. Please, where are you? Where are they sitting? There they are. There’s just a lot of people, it’s not easy to find people in this audience. Goes back further than you can see. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Great family, great incredible family, and he loved you a lot. And his wife said something very beautiful. The public, a lot of people, all of us, a lot of people have been very generous, and she said, “I’d rather have my husband.” That’s a good thing to say, that’s a good thing to say. “I’d rather have my husband.”
(12:51)
Corey Comperatore was a incredible husband and father, a devout Christian, a veteran, and a proud former fire chief. Very respected within the town, everybody knew him. Few men volunteered to run into fires, but Corey was one of those who did, he ran into fires. I spoke to people that were with… This guy would do anything. He was brave, right? Brave guy like you, and he was also a protector who put his life line for others and he loved doing it. And when the sound of gunshots pierced the air on that July evening, Corey leapt into the fire one more time. In his last seconds of this earth, he threw himself on the top of his wife and daughters, he didn’t want them hurt. He threw himself, he knew what was happening, he didn’t want them hurt, and he was hit hard, he was hit hard, and he gave his life to shield their lives.
(13:55)
Every father and husband in America hopes that if the time came, we would have what Corey had, tremendous courage, tremendous guts, and he wanted to protect his family, and he did protect his family. At this time it is 6:11, 12 weeks to the minute that the shooting began. I would like to ask everyone to join me in a moment of silence.

Music (14:20):

(Singing).

Donald Trump (17:23):

Wow. Now that is what you call a voice. One of the greatest opera singers in the world, and Christopher Macchio, who’s truly a great talent, is going to be back when I leave and I’m going to stay backstage watching every song he’s going to sing, three or four great songs, Nessun dorma and others. And so I wouldn’t leave you seat too fast when we’re finished today, but this is in honor of three great people, actually three great and in particular, Corey, and we appreciate it. But that is a real voice, isn’t it, huh? What do you think, Mr. future vice President, pretty good, right? I don’t know if you could do that JD, I don’t know. I don’t think JD can do that.
(18:12)
In the face of murderous hate, Corey answered, the most selfless kind of love. We are joined this evening by Corey’s incredible widow, Helen, his two precious daughters, Kaylee and Allyson. And his sisters, Kelly and Dawn, thank you so much. Thank you so much, this is an incredible tribute. This is a tribute like no other, and he deserves it. To Helen and the entire family, I can only begin to imagine the depths of your grief, but I want you to know that just like you, we will carry his memory in our hearts for as long as we live.
(18:49)
Everybody in this stadium and everybody that was there on that tragic evening, we are thinking about Corey, we think about him a lot, and I know he’s looking down on us right now from heaven smiling at his beloved wife and daughters, and his mother, Karen, and his entire family, his entire family. And he’s with you and he’s going to be with us for a long time because some people just don’t die in vain, and what he’s left behind is incredible, and so God bless you, Corey, God bless you, thank you very much, god bless you.
(19:34)
Just one little story. Helen told me that on the day that they came to the rally, Corey was really excited because somebody gave them great seats right up front here with the people from North Carolina, the ladies from North Carolina. This is their 227th rally, I don’t know what’s going on with them, those beautiful ladies, but they always seem to have good seats. But Corey had the best seat in the house, and he was telling his wife and family on the way over in the car, he said, “I’m telling you, he’s going to invite me up on the stage.” Because I do that sometimes, I take people, we invite them up in the stage.
(20:14)
And she smiled thinking it’ll never happen. And little did anyone realize that Corey would be on the stage three months later in an almost immortal position, and that’s where he is today. He’s on the stage in a, I think in not almost, I think it’s a truly immortal position. So the love that he showed on that day and throughout his life is the love that sustains the entire movement. The love that our families have, and it’s love of our communities and love of our country, it’s a force more powerful than any hatred and malice because even in the darkest hours it shines forth as a guide and it guides us like nothing could ever guide us. It guides us really like a candle in the night. And so it’s love Corey’s that is joining us to save our country, that’s going to heal our country, and that is going to reunite our country as one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
(21:20)
So what our opponents have never understood is that this movement has never been about me, it’s always been about you, it’s been about a lot of people, millions and millions of people, the biggest ever in the history of this country may be anywhere. And everyday people who are the heart and soul of our country, they love our movement, they love our country, and they know they’re doing right. Your hopes are my hopes, your dreams are my dreams, and your future is what I am fighting for every single day. And now I have a great companion in JD Vance, how good was he the other night? How good? He was great.

Speaker 1 (22:07):

JD, JD, JD, JD, JD, JD, JD, JD, JD.

Donald Trump (22:18):

He was great. But from the very beginning of this journey, I’ve been on a mission to rescue our country from a failed and very corrupt political establishment, very corrupt. We have to change it, we have to change it. We need also a very free and open press and to give it back to the country you believe in, and I believe in, it’s a country that we were born in and the country that you deserve, you deserve this.
(22:45)
And that mission, I will never quit, I will never bend, I will never break, I will never yield, not even in the face of death itself. And I believe that every citizen deserves an America with a very, very grand ambition, great opportunities, and limitless, we just want limitless potential. We want an America where you can get ahead and be proud of life and provide for your family in a really decent way, where we don’t have crime, we have a fabulous military to protect us from evil. Everything has to be the best, we have to have the best schools. We have to have strong borders, we don’t want bad people coming in and hurting us. We don’t want to have open borders, do we?
(23:38)
You deserve a government that protects and respects its own citizens, that defends your sovereignty, your security, and your dignity and your freedom. You deserve A nation that builds things again, makes things better, that aims for the stars once more, and that once again commands respect. And we want to get respect like we had it four years ago, the entire world respected us, they respected us. They respected us more than they’ve ever respected us, and now they laugh at us.
(24:12)
We can’t have them laugh at us, can we? Above all, you deserve leadership in Washington that does not answer to the lobbyists, to the bureaucrats, or to the corrupt special interest, but answers only to you, the hardworking citizens of America, which there are a lot of them, we have a lot of them. We have a lot of them. Over the past eight years, those who want to stop us from achieving this future have slandered me, impeached me, indicted me, tried to throw me off the ballot, and who knows, maybe even tried to kill me, but I’ve never stopped fighting for you, and I never will, never will. Never going to stop. Thank you. Thank you. And in turn, you have always stood with me. You have always stood with me. No matter what, you saw what was going on, you saw the hoaxes and the scams, you saw everything that went on. We are a team, we’re a great team I think. We’re probably the best team ever in the history of our country if you really think about it. We fought together, we have endured together, we have pushed onward together, and right here in Pennsylvania, we have bled together, we bled. We’ve had three people that really got hit hard, two of them made it, great doctors, great doctors. They weren’t supposed to make it, I wasn’t supposed to make it.
(25:49)
My great doctor at Butler said, “Sir, you’re the luckiest man alive. This would be a good time for you to go out and buy a lottery ticket. I’ve never seen anything like… ” I almost went out and bought a lottery ticket, I’ll take it. And 31 days from now here in this great commonwealth and all across our land, we are going to win together, we are going to vote together, we’re going to win the greatest election in the history of our country, maybe the greatest election all time. After we all have been through all of this together, nobody’s gone through what we’ve gone through, nobody. Because I go through it, you’re going through it too, but there’s never been anything like this. I always say there’s an enemy from within and there’s an outside enemy, and if you’re smart, the outside enemy is not going to be a problem. Russia, China, and North Korea, we’re not going to have a problem if you have a smart president. If you have not such a smart president, then it’s a problem, but we have an enemy from within, which I think is much more dangerous than the outside enemy.
(27:10)
We stand on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of our country, we can make these the four greatest years. We’ll turn it around so fast that your head will spin. With victory on November 5th, we are going to redeem America’s promise and unlock the extraordinary future that is just within our reach, it is now within our reach. Think of it one month from today, one month. We got to get there, we got to get there. They’ll drop all sorts of bombs, they’ll be hitting you JD, they’ll be hitting me. These people, they’ll hit and hit, but I think we’ve almost become immune to it, haven’t we? We’ve become immune to it, you got a little dose of it, couple of little doses. No, that’s, that’s the only way they can even think about winning with open borders.
(28:08)
Who wants open borders? Who wants men playing in women’s sports? Who wants sex change operations for illegal aliens in holding bins? No, I don’t think so. We will begin a new era of soaring income, skyrocketing wealth, millions and millions of new jobs, and a booming middle class. We are going to boom like we’ve never boomed before, and we’re going to unleash a manufacturing renaissance right here in Pennsylvania, including fracking like we’ve never fracked before. We’re going to frack, frack frack. Our opponent said, “There’ll be no fracking, no fracking, we’ll never frack, we’ll never frack.” Then when she started

Donald Trump (29:00):

We’re seeing poll numbers, by the way. And by the way, speaking of poll numbers, do you mind if I mentioned poll numbers? Because I only mentioned them when they’re good. I’d never mentioned it. But one that’s hit me really amazingly, Rasmussen, very highly respected poll. JD just came out. I don’t think you heard this one, but this is a shocker. They always say the Democrats will win the Hispanic vote, but we’ve been creeping up rather rapidly. And Rasmussen is one of the most respected polls. I mean, Republicans would get 4, 5, 6, 9, 10%. They just came out with a poll, 62% for Trump. Think of that. Think of that.
(29:40)
And 34% for Kamala. I don’t usually use her last name. Nobody knows who I’m talking about. I go, “Harris, Harris.” They say, “Who’s Harris?” It’s happening all the time. Who’s Harris? And we can’t find out who she is because if we do, our country is going to be in big trouble. We will live in a very beautiful city or town that are safe and clean with borders that are sealed and secure.
(30:18)
And again, we want people to come into our country. We all want that. We need that. But you know what? We want it to come in legally. They’re going to come in legally and love for our country. And America will once again be strong, and confident, and free. We’re going to have that. We’re going to have it strong, confident, and free. That’s why I’m here today. I could right now be having a beautiful life. I don’t have to be here. Instead, I could be on a gorgeous beach someplace. I have such nice property.
(30:52)
I could be be in Monte Carlo as an example, but I’d rather be in Butler with you. I would rather. I’d rather be in Butler. And I think JD would rather be in Butler. JD?

Audience (31:23):

We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you

Donald Trump (31:23):

No, I’d rather be here because we’re doing something. They get a lot of rich guys that go, “Nobody cares about him.”

Audience (31:29):

We love you.

Donald Trump (31:30):

I had one about a month ago, very, very rich guy, and he called me up. He said, “President…” I’ve known him for a long time. I don’t say how long because I don’t want my wife to hear that number. It’s a long time. But he’s very successful. And he said to me, “Sir, could you do me a favor?” Guy is worth billions of dollars. He said, “Could you do me a favor? I can’t get into a restaurant. Do you think you could call them to get me in?” And I said, “What the hell is the good of being rich if you can’t get into a restaurant?”
(31:59)
And I called the maitre D, “Hi,” I’m a little embarrassed, “Hi, this is Donald Trump.” “I recognize your voice.” I said, “Would you do me a favor? A friend of mine is online about a mile back. This is a very successful restaurant. And he’s got his wife.” I describe the wife. “Could you possibly go get them? Could you go get them and bring them in?” And he did. And my friend called me up the next day. He said, “Thank you very much. Thank you.”

Audience (32:23):

Donald Trump (32:25):

(34:19)
Through the perilous fight.
(34:19)
O’er the ramparts we watched.
(34:19)
Were so gallantly, yeah, streaming.
(34:19)
And the rockets’ red glare.
(34:19)
The bombs bursting in air.
(34:19)
Gave proof through the night.

That our flag was still there.
(34:19)
Fight, fight, fight.

Audience (38:35):

[inaudible 00:38:42]

Donald Trump (38:45):

People are here for a long time and we appreciate it very much. And so sometimes that happens. A lot of times that happens actually. But you’ll be great, you watch. So 12 weeks ago, we all took a bullet for America and all we are all asking is that everyone goes out and votes. We got to win. We can’t let this happen to our country. We can’t take another four years like this. We won’t have a country left. We’re not going to have a country left. And all of this will be for nothing if you don’t get out and vote. It will all be for nothing. We will have talked about it. And if we do it’ll be the greatest achievement, I think in the history of politics for all of us for this age because we’re going to change our country around and fast.
(39:28)
We’re going to do things that nobody thought were possible. We’re going to do them fast. So Pennsylvania’s time to stand up for America and time to save our country. This is really about saving our country. It’s never been like this. When you look at the crime, look at the crime, look at the people that are coming in. Murderers. 13,099 murderers led in over the last short period of time.
(39:54)
Murderers that have been released from penitentiaries, prisons, jails released into our country. Crime rates all over the world are down. They’re taking their gang members and their criminals. They’re taking their people in jail and they’re releasing them into our country. We can’t have it. We just can’t have it. How do you get more simple than that? They’re releasing murderers. They’re releasing drug dealers. They’re releasing gang members and criminals. Human traffickers. Mostly they traffic in women and they’re releasing them all into our country, and they’re emptying their jails. And their crime rates in Venezuela are way down because… But it’s not only in South America, it’s all over the world. And Africa, the Congo.
(40:43)
A lot of people coming out of the Congo in Africa. They’re coming out from Asia. They’re coming out from the Middle East, Yemen. They’re coming out from Yemen. A lot of people coming out of Yemen, and they’re known terrorists, and they just release them into our country from countries unknown also. They know nothing about the people. They’ll go right in. These people are crazy. And we have to win. We’ll stop it immediately and we’ll have to… Look, it will be a big deportation.
(41:15)
We’re going to deport these people. We’re going to get them out of our country immediately. Or we won’t have a country. And if we win Pennsylvania, we will win the whole thing. The whole thing will be won. So for the sake of our families, for the sake of our children, we will keep on going. And as the expression goes, I mean, I’m a little embarrassed to say it, to be honest you, but I’m going to say it because a lot of people do say it, we will fight, fight, fight.

Audience (41:45):

Fight, fight, fight.

Donald Trump (41:47):

Going to fight for our country.

Audience (41:50):

Fight, fight, fight, fight.

Donald Trump (41:51):

We’re going to fight for our country.

Audience (41:51):

Fight, fight, fight, fight.

Donald Trump (41:53):

And together we will save this country. We will restore the republic and America’s future will be bigger, better, bolder, brighter, happier, stronger, freer and greater and more united than ever before. Our country will be united. You’ll watch, you’ll watch. We had the most successful country ever, maybe in the world during my term. We are the greatest economy that we’ve ever had. And you know what was happening? We were uniting the other side, radical left. People were coming over. They wanted to meet. They were coming over. Women, men. If you look at population, our black population, our Hispanic population, our Asian population, everybody was doing better.
(42:38)
People that went to the best schools and best colleges in the world got the highest marks. And people that couldn’t get a high school degree, everybody was doing better. And our country was coming together. And then we got hit with COVID, a gift from China. Some people would call it the China virus. And we did a great job on that too. We did a great job. But the world was disturbed.
(43:00)
$60 trillion in damage worldwide. Tens of millions of people killed, and we still during this four-year period, we had the greatest economy. One of the great countries of the world. And we left with the stock market that was higher than it was just prior to COVID coming in. So what we did was something really incredible. But we had the greatest, most successful country ever. We had the greatest economy in our history and we’re going to do it again. And maybe even better. We learned a lot. We learned a lot about people and about doing things, and what works, and what doesn’t work. And we’re going to do it. And it’s going to be quick. It’s going to be quick.
(43:42)
We’re going to have safe cities, and we’re going to have great cities again. And we’re going to have a capital in Washington, DC which is right now crime-ridden. You leave from the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, you go drive down to Washington DC and you drive down and you end up getting murdered. You end up getting hurt, you get mugged. We are going to straighten out Washington DC. We’re going to make it again, the most beautiful capital in the world.
(44:09)
We’re not going to have graffiti. We’re not going to have graffiti on our marble columns. We’re not going to have roads that have potholes all over them and medians that are falling into the highways. We’re going to run it properly. We’re going to change it. We’re going to run it properly. It’s an embarrassment to us. Can you imagine foreign leaders coming in and running over roads that haven’t been paved in years? We’re honored to be joined tonight by one of the people who is going to help us build this incredible future. And he is a truly incredible guy. And I don’t say that that often.
(44:48)
He’s a great gentleman. He’s done such an unbelievable job for North Carolina, for Georgia, for Alabama, for Florida, for Tennessee. His name is Elon Musk. He saved free speech. He created so many different great things. Where is he? Come on up here, Elon. He created the first major American car company in generations. And his rocket company is the only reason we can now send American astronauts into space. Come here. Take over, Elon. Yes, take over.

Elon Musk (45:33):

Hi, everyone. As you can see, I’m not just MAGA, I’m dark MAGA. Well, first of all, I want to say what an honor it is to be here. And the true test of someone’s character is how they behave under fire. We had one president who couldn’t climb a flight of stairs and another who was fist pumping after getting shot. Fight, fight, fight. Blood coming down the face.

Audience (46:16):

Fight, fight, fight, fight.

Elon Musk (46:17):

Now America is the home of the brave. And there’s no true test than courage under fire. So who do you want representing America?

Audience (46:33):

Trump.

Elon Musk (46:35):

Yeah, absolutely. And I think this election, I think it’s the most important election of our lifetime. This is no ordinary election. The other side wants to take away your freedom of speech. They want to take away your right to bear arms. They want to take away your right to vote effectively. You got 14 states now that don’t require voter ID. California, where I used to live, just passed the law, banning voter ID for voting. I still can’t believe that’s real. So how you supposed to have a good proper election, if there’s no ID. It’s just meaningless. And free speech, free speech is the bedrock of democracy. And if people don’t know what’s going on, if they don’t know the truth, how can you make an informed vote? You must have free speech in order to have democracy. That’s why it’s the First Amendment. And the Second Amendment is there to ensure that we have the First Amendment. President Trump must win to preserve the constitution. He must win to preserve democracy in America.

Audience (48:27):

We want Trump, we want Trump, we want Trump, we want Trump, we want Trump, we want Trump, we want Trump, we want Trump, we want Trump..

Elon Musk (48:38):

This is a must-win situation, must win. So I have one ask for everyone in the audience, everyone who watches this video, everyone in the live stream, there’s one request. It’s very important. Register to vote. Okay? And get everyone you know, and everyone you don’t know, you drag them to register to vote. There’s only two days left to register to vote in Georgia and Arizona. 48 hours. Text people now, now. And then make sure they actually do vote.
(49:22)
If they don’t, this will be the last election. That’s my prediction. Nothing is more important. Nothing is more important. So get everyone you know. So I’m speaking to people out there. Everyone in the crowd I think is already convinced. But for people out there that are watching the video, watching the live stream, you need to get everyone at work, your friends, family, text groups, your social media, everything, get them to register to vote right now. Only two days left for Georgia and Arizona. Only a couple of weeks left in Pennsylvania. And if they’re not registered to vote, it doesn’t matter at that point. Register to vote. I’m being repetitive for a reason. So nothing is more important. And a lot of people think maybe their vote doesn’t count. Well, it does. Okay? It does. It matters. And this election could be decided by a thousand votes, 500 votes, a tiny margin. So get everyone you know to register to vote. I believe it’s swampthevote.com. I believe that’s the site. Double check that your registration is good. Don’t take it for granted.
(50:42)
I’m just being repetitive about this point because it is the one takeaway more than anything that will matter is getting those registrations and then getting everyone you know to actually vote. That is what we’ll decide this election, especially in Pennsylvania. So thank you. And honestly, you want to just be a pest. Just be a pest to everyone you know. People on the street, everywhere. Vote, vote, vote. Fight, fight, fight. Vote, vote, vote. Thank you.

Donald Trump (51:41):

What a great guy. And he’d rather be making rocket ships because he’d really rather do that. Nobody better. I think he’s got 90% of the rockets that go up. But Elon, thank you very much. Incredible, incredible. What he says is true. What he says is true. We’re all having fun here tonight. But if we don’t register and if we don’t vote, we’re just going to look upon this as another sort of nice day in our life. But it won’t even be a nice day. We’re going to look back and we’re going to say, “Wow, it’s a lot of time, a lot of effort. We got to win.” If we don’t win, it’s as he said, it’s just not important. We have to save our country. So you have to get out and vote. You got to get out and vote. You got to get your friends and vote because they play a lot of tricks this particular other side.
(52:26)
Elon is a very nice guy. He doesn’t want to say it, but they play a lot of tricks. We can’t let it happen. We can’t let it happen again. We can’t let it happen. And one thing, they showed us how bad they are, they showed us how bad a job they do. So that’s one thing we got from this four years. They’ve done the worst job. It’s the worst president in the history of our country. It’s the worst vice president in the history of our country. And if you watched over the last couple of days, they are doing… This is a Katrina for them.
(52:54)
This is one of the worst. They say it’s the worst job ever done on helping people through the ravages of a hurricane. And they’re watching… She’s out there, out there campaigning in San Francisco, a place that she ruined. Okay? She ruined. She ruined San Francisco. She ruined… Think of this. She ruined San Francisco. She was the worst DA. And she ruined the state of California, and now she wants to ruin the United States of America. We can’t let her do it.
(53:23)
So I called Elon to tell him that they needed Starlink as an example. They couldn’t get Starlink. I didn’t know what Starlink was. I must tell you. Elon, I’m so embarrassed. I didn’t know what the hell Starlink was. He loves Starlink. He can tell you every little screw that’s needed, every wire. Me, I didn’t know. But when I was in North Carolina and Georgia just the other day, yesterday to be exact, but they were saying, we have tremendous communications especially in North Carolina. And we have tremendous problems. We have no communication. The poles were ripped down, the wires were underwater, houses were destroyed.
(54:06)
Possibly a thousand people. Maybe more will be. There’s 600 people missing. Missing is not good. Because you know what missing means generally. That’s really bad. And they had no communication. They had literally no communication with, they called it the mainland because the water was so crazy. It was like they were in the middle of a lake and they’d never seen anything like it. And they said, “Do you know somebody named Elon Musk?” I said, “Yeah, I happened to know him a little bit. He just endorsed me actually.”
(54:33)
Well, he endorsed me a long time ago, but he still… To me, every day is a good endorsement from Elon. Nobody is smarter than Elon. And they said, “Could you do us a favor? Could you help us? We’re trying to get Starlink and it’s very hard to get. Most people say, you can’t even get it.” I called up Elon. I said, “North Carolina is in big trouble. Georgia is in big trouble. They need communication. They have none because their poles have been knocked down and their wires are underwater and even dangerous. dangerously underwater. But they have no communication. Elon, could you do something about Starlink? Whatever the hell that is, Elon. Whatever, Starlink. That’s all they want to hear is Starlink.”
(55:12)
And an amazing thing happened. I got a call from one of the top people in North Carolina. I got a call from another great person in Georgia. And I wasn’t finished with my phone call yet, and they got word that Starlink would be delivered to the States. No. And I said, “What the hell is he… What kind of a system is that? Normally you’d have to hang up and he’d go and call people.” He did it during the phone call. What kind of a system do you have? That’s why he’s a very advanced, he is a very advanced person, but I want to thank you, Elon because I got it. And I said, “How does it work? Two days later, how does it work?” They said, “Much better than the wires.”
(55:55)
So now I’m saying, “Why the hell are they… You’re going to come out very well anyway.” And he also said, “You don’t have to pay me. You pay someday when you get the money back. You don’t have to pay me.” He wanted nothing. He’s a great guy. Thank you, Elon, for being here. Thank you very much. Great honor, great honor.

Audience (56:12):

[inaudible 00:56:13] Elon, Elon, Elon, Elon, Elon, Elon, Elon, Elon, Elon, Elon.

Donald Trump (56:31):

Thank you, Elon. And that’s heartfelt. I can’t even see the end. That’s a lot of people here today. We’re also joined by a great gentleman, a top, top, brilliant student. He went to a tremendous college and he graduated right at the top of his class in two years. I didn’t know you could do, that’s four-year college. Then he went to the military then he came out and he did fantastically inside the military. Then he came out, he went to Yale without the benefit of family ties. You know what that means? Right? That’s pretty good without family ties. I don’t know too many of those people. They had no family ties. He got in. He can’t get in, and he graduated along with his wife. They’re not going to have any problems with your kids academically. I can tell you.
(57:18)
His wife and him were like the top students in the class. But he went to Yale Law School and then he went out into the private sector, did great. Then he ran for the senate and he did fantastically. He won. And he’s like a rocket ship. He’s like one of Elon’s rocket ships the way his career is going. But you see why? Because he’s a really brilliant guy. And you saw that the other night in the debate. Right? You saw that the other night in the debate. You know the expression they have? If that were a fight, they would’ve stopped it. Right?
(57:52)
So I just want to thank JD. I was always confident in that pick. And we had great people too, JD. Every

Donald Trump (58:00):

Every one of those guys were great. Every one of them would have done a great job. It was amazing. But we appreciate the job you’re doing. He’s also very energetic, and he’ll go on anywhere. He’ll go on MSDNC. I say, “Oh, he’s done that.” He’ll go on CNN. He has no problem. He swats them like this. He has no problem. No, it’s true. Other people say, “Sir, I’d rather not do that one. I’d rather not do that one, sir. I’d rather not do them,” because they are very … With him, he doesn’t care. He says, “They’re not going to outsmart me.” So I want to thank JD. You’ve done a great job. Thank you very much. Amazing. Great.
(58:52)
We have a lot of senators and a lot of people from Congress. I’m going to introduce a few of them that are really outstanding, and they are warriors. They’re great Patriots. Senator Eric Schmitt. Where’s Eric Schmitt? He’s around here someplace. Nice, tall, handsome guy. Thank you, Eric. What a great job you’ve done. He helps us so much with the Senate, and we’ve got a great Senate. We have to get a couple of more senators elected. I think it’s going to happen, too. I think it’s going to happen.
(59:23)
We have members of Congress here, Dan Meuser. Dan? Where’s Dan? Great, great job. Real warrior. These are warriors. Guy Reschenthaler. That’s the hardest name in the Senate to pronounce, but I’ve learned how to pronounce it. Guy, thank you very much. Great. Where’s Guy? Guy? Thank you very much, Guy? Glenn GT Thompson. Fantastic guy. Thanks, Glenn. Great job. John Joyce. Thank you, John. Great. Cory Mills. He’s out there fighting, too. He’s out there. He is out there in North Carolina, Georgia. He’s out there helping people.
(01:00:05)
Mike Waltz, who’s a tremendous national security asset. Thank you, Mike. Thank you, Mike. Okay. And a man who was my doctor, I got to know him as a doctor in the White House. And then before that, he was actually an admiral. And then he went to the White House. He was a great admiral. He was a great doctor, and I love him for one reason. They asked him in the White House. The press, the fake news media said, “Who is the most …” He was the doctor for Obama, Bush, and Trump. That’s pretty good, right? White House doctor for the three of us.
(01:00:42)
He said, the press, “Who is the healthiest of the three?” He said, “Definitely, it’s Donald Trump. There’s not even a contest.” I love that guy. JD, when he said that, I said, “I like this guy.” So then “You know, sir?” He was leaving the White House. He said, “I’d love to run for Congress.” He ran against 28 people. They were all running for the Republican primary because whoever won that primary is going to win. I think it’s a Trump plus 48. Whoever wins gets 48-point start.
(01:01:17)
Not only did he win, he won easily, and now he’s one of the most popular people in Congress and one of the most talented, maybe more importantly. Ronny Jackson. Ronny? Where is Ronny? Where is you? Oh, good. Thank you, Ronny. You got a lot of talent surrounding you there. I think it’s very important, also. We’re here for a reason, and that’s to win and to honor Corey, but Corey wants us to win, too.
(01:01:45)
There’s a man in the audience that’s been very much a career path a little bit like JD, great student, great, talented student, and fantastic in the military, then went out to be a tremendous success, one of the most successful people on Wall Street, actually. He’s tough, and he’s smart. He’s going to make sure you always have fracking in Pennsylvania, and he’s going to make sure you have many other things other than fracking.
(01:02:10)
You have a senator that now does nothing. He does nothing, and he doesn’t fight for you. He votes with Biden, if you can believe it, 100% of the time. We’re lucky that he does it. I don’t know. He might not have done it if he had it to do again. I don’t know. But I think he’s just one of the most outstanding people anywhere in the country to run for office, and we’re lucky that he’s doing it. He’s got a real shot. He’s doing very well in the polls.
(01:02:37)
It’s hard to beat somebody that’s been there a long time, but this is somebody that’s been there a long time and did nothing. He did nothing. His name is David McCormick, and he’s great. I hope he’s going to be your next senator. I see somebody else. I didn’t know he was here. Mike Kelly. I see Mike Kelly here. Stand up. Oh, boy, am I lucky. Am I lucky I spotted him. If I didn’t spot you, Mike, I was in big trouble, right? This is a man who’s beloved in this state, and he’s fantastic. So thank you, Mike. Thank you.
(01:03:18)
We also have some terrific people from law enforcement, Butler County Sheriff Mike Slupe. Thank you, Mike. Great job. Thank you. Thank you, Mike. Thank you for your help, too. I could tell you. Thank you for your help. I can say that. Thank you very much. Butler County Commissioner Leslie Osche. Leslie, thank you. Thank you, Leslie. Great job. RNC Chairman Michael Whatley, this guy is doing a great job. He’s doing great. Came from North Carolina. We won North Carolina.
(01:03:56)
He kept their cheating down to a minimum, and we were able to win it. We were solid all night long. He’s great, but if we don’t have good results by the 6th of November, I will never say that about him again. No, he’s a great guy. He’s working very hard. 24 hours a day, he’s working. I know that. He’s working mostly on Stop the Steal because we have a lot of votes. We have plenty of votes. Stop the Steal. That’s why you’ve got to get out. You’ve got to get out and vote. We’re going to win this thing.
(01:04:25)
The more we win it, it’s too big to rig, the expression we use. Make it too big to rig. Elon would understand this better than anybody. Statistically, at a certain point, their cheating doesn’t matter. We want to make it too big to rig. We also have somebody that’s very special, the co-chair of the Republican Party, Lara Trump. Thank you. Lara, thanks.
(01:04:57)
Oftentimes with families, they say, “Oh, why did you put that one in or this one in?” All the different people, so many people have problems with that. In her case, everyone said, “How the hell did you get her to do it? She has been unbelievable.” So thank you very much. Comes from North Carolina, and I have a feeling she’s going to be spending some time down there a little bit. She’s married to my wonderful son, Eric, who’s right here. So, Eric, please stand up. He’s a great guy.
(01:05:33)
Eric has a distinction. He has gotten more subpoenas than any man in the history of our country by about 10 times. Every day Congress would meet, they’d send him a subpoena. What is it about? They have no idea. But I think he’s got the all-time record, and he’s handled it all beautifully. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. A friend of mine, a great, great businessman, one of the most respected people, and he made a big, big contribution yesterday to Georgia and a big contribution to North Carolina. Steve Witkoff is here. Hi, Steve. Thanks.
(01:06:08)
Another man who’s one of the greatest businessmen in the country, he actually said that, “If Trump doesn’t win, this country is going to go into a massive depression.” Well, I don’t know about that, but he has been a very good predictor, I will say that, and truly one of the greats, one of the great pickers, picker meaning stocks. He knows what he’s doing and highly respected by everybody. John Paulson. Thank you, John. Great. Great guy.
(01:06:37)
Now, we have so many others, and I won’t do it because we have to really get out of here before it gets too cold for people, but I just … I love it much better because there’s one teleprompter, not that I use the teleprompters too much. Isn’t it nice to have a president that doesn’t need a teleprompter? No, we don’t want it. We don’t need it. But this one was right smack in the sun. Great job back there, fellas. They said, “The teleprompters are working fine.” Well, thank goodness.
(01:07:10)
Did you see what happened the other day with the teleprompter with her? That was not a pretty sight. The teleprompter went off, and she went off, too. She didn’t know what the hell happened. Teleprompters are very dangerous because they go off a lot. You have to be prepared for them to go off, cold blank. You’ll have 100,000 people. You have 75,000 people. You have this. If the teleprompter goes off, you got to be able to move. She did not move well. This was not a good situation.
(01:07:39)
But three more heroes from July 13 who rendered first aid to Corey incredibly, Dr. Jim Sweetland, Rico Elmore, who was unbelievable. Rico, you were unbelievable. He ran over National Guard. He ran over and grabbed Corey, and Corey was still living. He was doing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a man who was really in bad shape like nobody’s ever seen. His family appreciates it, and I do, too. So thank you, Rico, very much. Amazing, amazing.
(01:08:21)
Amazing the people that we have. You learn about them under times like this. That’s when you really learn. So we’re going to be seeing Rico again. Ed Shear, fantastic job. Thank you, Ed. We appreciate it. Thank you, Ed. Thank you. Thank you very much, Ed. Great job. In addition, this evening, we have to send our prayers and support to all the families affected by Hurricane Helene. This has been the worst hurricane response by a president and vice president since Katrina, and this is simply not acceptable.
(01:08:53)
Those people, I was there yesterday with North Carolina and Georgia. I’ll tell you. By the way, the governor of Georgia is doing an excellent job, excellent job. But we have other people that aren’t doing a good job, and we have to have them do a good job. But the federal government is doing a very bad job. They are not doing the job, and we have death and destruction that we haven’t seen maybe ever. It’s a real bad one. They have to get people there because they don’t have people there. They don’t have the people.
(01:09:23)
Kamala wined and dined in San Francisco, and all of the people in North Carolina, no helicopters, no rescue. It’s just what’s happened there is very bad. They’re offering them $750 to people whose homes have been washed away. And yet we send tens of billions of dollars to foreign countries that most people have never heard of. They’re offering them $750. They’ve been destroyed. These people have been destroyed. The one young lady washed … You saw that with her son. I wish I never saw it, but just washed away. Your son was washed away with the grandparents. So sad.
(01:10:05)
They’re giving them $750. Think of it. We give foreign countries hundreds of billions of dollars, and we’re handing North Carolina $750. If you want a president who won’t even try to save you when the floodwaters are rising, vote for Kamala. She’s not the right person. Look, you know what? If they did a good job, I wouldn’t have run, to be honest with you. I didn’t need to do this. I didn’t need to. If I thought they were doing an even modestly good job, I wouldn’t have run.
(01:10:38)
But I saw right from the beginning, grossly incompetent, and I was right about that. I decided to run, and we’re doing really well. I was telling you about polls. We’re way up in some polls. We’re up in other polls. With the swing states, I think most of them have us up in every single swing state, including the great commonwealth of a place called Pennsylvania. Don’t ever not call it a commonwealth because I’ve seen people call it a state, and that’s the end of them. That’s practically the end of their political career.
(01:11:12)
You got to be very careful with Pennsylvania. It’s that commonwealth. I haven’t made that mistake. I don’t want to either. It was not a pretty picture. If you want a president who will stop at nothing to protect you and your family, I hope you’re going to vote for a gentleman named Donald J. Trump. Have you heard of him? Together, we will rebuild western North Carolina, rural Georgia, and every other state that’s been so badly affected. That includes Alabama.
(01:11:43)
Virginia was very hit hard. South Carolina was hit very hard, Florida, so many states, Tennessee was hit really hard. They were all hit, and we’re going to work with them. The next president is going to be the one that really once they get … They got to get this done. But once that happens, the next president is going to be the one that has to really help them. JD will be there to help them. I know that.
(01:12:09)
2024 is the most important election in the history of our country, and here are the facts. My opponent, Kamala Harris, is the most incompetent and far-left nominee ever to run for president. She’s much further left than crazy Bernie Sanders. You know that. She wants to open borders. She took the most secure border in US history and turned it into the worst border in the history of the world. Remember, she was appointed border czar. She says she wasn’t now after three years, but she was. But whether she was or not, she was in charge of the border.
(01:12:45)
The other day I saw her get up and say, “We will do this. We will do that.” Why didn’t they do it four years ago? Why didn’t they do it? The damage is so bad and so … It’s been done. She let in 21 million illegal aliens from all over the world, from prisons and jails and mental institutions and insane asylums. There are terrorists at record levels, at levels we’ve never seen before.
(01:13:09)
She costs you $29,000 a family through inflation price hikes, and now she wants a larger tax hike in … She wants to go to the largest tax hike in American history. There’s never been a tax hike like what she’s proposing. She’s going to raise your taxes a minimum of $3,000. She’s a big taxer, and she was the original creator of Defund the Police. I think for all the sheriffs over here, if you’re a partner in Defund the Police for even two days, you cannot be president.
(01:13:41)
But she was one of the founders of Defund the Police, and she still believes that, by the way. I don’t know how anybody could, but she still believes that. If she ever had a chance, there’s a good possibility she’d go back to it. Can you imagine somebody’s robbing our house? Well, there’s nothing we can do about it. They tried it. You know where they tried it? In Minnesota with our vice president and it wasn’t working out too well. It was working out very well for the robbers and the criminals. That’s the only one it was working out well for.
(01:14:12)
Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE. She wants mass amnesty and citizenship for illegals. This is maybe the worst thing in the whole … that nobody talks. The fake news won’t mention it. She lost more than 325,000 migrant children that are now dead, in slavery, or just plain missing, probably never to be seen again, never to see their parents again. This is 325,000 have been lost.
(01:14:44)
She praised the idea of a 70% to an 80% tax rate. She imposed a natural gas export ban on Pennsylvania, which is killing your energy workers and your pricing. You have one of the highest energy costs in the country, and yet you’re sitting on top of a massive amount of energy that she doesn’t want to get. It’s been a disaster for your state. Now she’s vowed repeatedly, now all of a sudden, she changed her mind.
(01:15:12)
With politicians, it’s always the first statement that comes out to be the one they want. So she’s spent 14 years knocking fracking. “We’re never going to have fracking. We’re not going to frack.” All of a sudden, a little while ago, she came out, “I love fracking very much.” No, she’ll go back to it. She even endorsed free sex changes for illegal aliens in detention at taxpayer expense. I don’t think Elon likes that idea. These are not ideas that Elon Musk likes too much.
(01:15:41)
It was just announced yesterday in California. He took this one from me. I’m so upset. But think of it, that the far less than average governor, Gavin New scum, has banned any and all ID requirements from voting and registering to vote. You’re not even allowed to mention the fact, Elon. You’re not allowed to mention the fact. You can’t say, “May I see your ID?” If you do, it’s a criminal act. This is a takeover of the country. You’re not allowed to ask for an ID. If you do, it’s a criminal count.
(01:16:17)
Other Democrat states are following. This is only so they can cheat. There’s only one thing that you do this for, so that you can cheat on elections. There’s no other conceivable reason. Kamala Harris is a radical left Marxist. She is a woman that’s not respected in Congress. She was laughed at at Congress. Nobody thought she could win. They did a coup of Biden, whether you like him or not. I’m not a particularly big fan.
(01:16:45)
But we had a debate, and debate ended. All of a sudden, they come to him and they say, “We want you out. You’re not going to win the election.” He said, “I don’t want to get out.” He got 14 million votes, if you believe in democracy or the system. He got 14 million votes, and she got none. She was the first one out, 22 candidates, and she never made it to Iowa. She quit before Iowa, and now she’s running. That’s okay. But we spent $150 million beating Biden.
(01:17:14)
As soon as he was down and out for the count, they say, “Let’s take him out. We’ll get somebody else to run.” Never happened before. We do a lot of firsts. I will tell you. We do a lot of firsts. But she’s a person that rated even worse in every statistic than any other senator. She was rated at the bottom of the US Senate. She’s destroyed everything she touched, but the good news is that we have a plan to fix it. We’re going to fix it, and we’re going to fix it fast.
(01:17:43)
Nobody is going to stand for open borders. Nobody is going to stand for a bad military. Nobody is going to stand for education that’s not proper. We’re moving education back to the states. You’re going to be running your own … Education is so important. What’s more important than education? But we rank at the bottom of every list. They rank 40 major countries. We’re at the bottom, but we’re top of the list as the cost per pupil.
(01:18:15)
We spend more per pupil, per student, than any other country anywhere in the world. So we’re number one in that, and we’re number 38, 39 or 40 every single time. You have Denmark. You have Sweden. You have Norway. You have China’s always the top five. Can you believe it? China’s the top five. That’s amazing. But we’re going to move our education back to the states, so places like Indiana and Iowa and Idaho and states that you don’t even hear too much of because they’re so good and so well-run, they’re going to run their own education.
(01:18:53)
You know what’s going to come out of that? A Denmark, a Norway, a Sweden. Maybe, I don’t even know, China. Can you imagine? China with 1.4 billion people is a top five and we’re close to 40. We are 40 sometimes. Starting on day one, I will seal the border and stop the migrant invasion into our country. We will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of the United States. Dwight Eisenhower right now has that record.
(01:19:27)
By the way, it’s not something I want to do. I dread having to do it, but we have no choice. What they’ve done to our country is not even believable, especially the criminals, the criminal element that’s in our country. And again, all over the world, crime rates are down because they’ve taken their criminals and they’ve dumped them into the United States. You know what? I would have been worse than them. I would have had it done even faster.
(01:19:50)
They’ve dumped them into the United States of America, and that’s what we have. It’s dangerous out there. We’re getting them out. We’re getting them out quickly. We will defeat inflation, and we will make America affordable again. It’s going to start with liquid gold. We have more liquid gold, oil and gas ,under our feet than any nation in the world, including Saudi Arabia and Russia.
(01:20:14)
We will become energy-independent like we were just four years ago. Four years ago, we were energy independent. Can you believe it? And then we were going to become energy-dominant. We will be dominant within a matter of months, and we will make so much money. We are going to drill, baby, drill. We will again open ANWR. Ronald Reagan tried to do it. Every single president from before Reagan tried to do it, and I got it done.
(01:20:46)
ANWR is the largest drilling site anywhere in the world. It could be larger than Saudi Arabia. It could be larger than Russia. It’s in Alaska. I got it done, and we worked to get it done. One of the first things he did was terminate ANWR, and that was going to take care of all of Asia. That was going to make us so much money. We would have paid off debt. I gave you the biggest tax reduction in history. You would have gotten even a bigger one. You were going to be just very happy. You were going to say, “I like that guy very much.”
(01:21:18)
20 million Americans are behind on their electric bills right now. It was just announced. 20 million Americans, they’re struggling to pay their monthly bills at a record rate. There’s never been anything like it. It’s all because of their anti-US energy regime, which has caused Pennsylvania electricity prices to raise almost 50%. We will cut energy and electricity prices in half within 12 months.
(01:21:43)
We will have your prices, your air conditioning, heating, cars if you buy a Tesla, which is good. Whoo, it’s good. We will have your energy prices cut in half. It’ll be cut in half within a period of one year from January 20th, which is the day we take office. That’s going to save you a lot of money. That’s going to bring down the prices of everything because more than anything else, people tell me about the groceries, the groceries, our groceries.
(01:22:15)
What they’re talking about is food. Everything’s going to be coming down when we do that. We’re also going to get your interest rates way down. We will bring automobile manufacturing back to the United States at levels never seen before, and we will turn the United States into a manufacturing superpower again. It hasn’t been there in many, many years. We had it started four years ago.
(01:22:38)
The centerpiece of my plan for a manufacturing renaissance will be a 15% made-in-America corporate tax rate. In other words, if you make your product in the United States, you get a rate. So I cut it from 39% to 21%. Everyone said that was impossible. I got it done, and we had the best boom we’ve ever had. We did more revenue when we had it at 21 than when it was at 39. Think of it. Much more. The following year we did much more.
(01:23:08)
And then I’m going to take it from 21 to 15, which will make us the most competitive country in the world. Nobody will be able to compete with us. But that 15 rate only goes for those who make their product in America. They have to make their product here, otherwise, they pay 21. We will protect those companies moving into America, and all of our existing companies, with stiff tariffs placed on companies that don’t move in.
(01:23:38)
If they don’t come in, if they don’t want to make their product here, that’s fine, but they’re going to be tariffed. We have to protect our companies, and that’s what we’re going to do. The only way they can get out of paying those tariffs is to build their plants and factories in America. We may even be able to get Elon to build some of them. I think we will. And hire American workers for the job. We’re going to hire American workers for the job.
(01:24:02)
We will pass the Reciprocal Trade Act. If China or any other country charges us 100 or 200% tax, then we will likewise charge them a 100 or 200% tax. We had a lot of problems on that one with the Senate, and we’re going to get that done. Think of it. They charge us, and we don’t charge them. Now, they charge us. We’re going to charge them the same thing, reciprocal. It’s reciprocal.
(01:24:28)
I will not let Mexico, China, or any other country sell cars into the United States to the detriment of our auto workers who will better than they have ever done. We’re going to bring back the car business like it was 50, 60, and 70 years ago. Everyone’s going to want to be back here. I will not approve Japan buying US Steel, 70 years ago, the greatest company anywhere in the world. It was the greatest company anywhere in the world, and now we have Japan buying US Steel. I don’t like that.
(01:25:00)
We will deliver massive tax cuts for workers, and we will have a policy that I think is so great, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security for our great seniors, no tax. When you think of it, our seniors were hurt so badly. Inflation has killed our seniors. They have a fixed income, and it just got worse and worse every week. Every month, it’s gotten worse and worse, and it’s just horrible. They haven’t gone down. They’ve only gone up. Prices have still only gone up.
(01:25:39)
While working Americans catch up, we’re going to put a temporary cap on the credit card interest rates at 10%. People are paying 28% interest, 25% interest. I will always protect Social Security and Medicare with no cuts. We’re not going to do anything with Social Security, but they’re going to destroy Social Security because all of the migrants coming in are going on between Medicare, Social Security, other programs, and nobody is able to afford it.
(01:26:06)
I will settle the war in Ukraine. I will end the chaos in the Middle East, and I will prevent, I promise you, World War III. We’re not going to have World War III. Right now, we’re very close to having it. We will lead the world in space exploration. Thank you, Elon. We will lead the world in military, and we will reach Mars before the end of my term. Elon promised me he was going to do that. I don’t know. Can you do that? Stand up. Can we do that?
(01:26:37)
I think he’s going to do it. JD, work on him. Work on him. Work on him. JD is working on Elon. No, he told me that we’re going to win, and he’s going to reach Mars by the end of our term, which is a big thing, before China, before anybody.

Donald Trump (01:27:00):

And my money’s on that guy right there. We will rebuild our cities, including Washington, D.C., making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. And we will keep the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. It’s losing right now. It’s losing right now. But I’ll be able to do it. Other people won’t. I’ll tell these countries, as they leave us on the… I say, “You want to do business in the United States? You’re going back into the reserve currency. And if you don’t, we’re going to charge you a big, fat, beautiful tax to do business in the United States.” And they’re going to say, “I would love very much to go back into the US reserve currency.” No, we’re going to save it. But these people aren’t going to save it. They don’t know how to talk. They don’t know how to think.
(01:27:43)
Together, we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates, and low inflation, so that everyone can afford groceries, a beautiful car, and a home. Very basic. It’s very basic. We will stop the invasion, end migrant crime, strengthen our military, build a missile defense shield around our country, keep critical race theory and transgender insanity, we’re going to keep it the hell out of our school. We’re going to keep that insanity out of our school. And as I said, we will keep men out of women’s sports. So demeaning to women.
(01:28:28)
You saw that in the Olympics. They have female boxing, women’s boxing, and a young lady from Italy, very good boxer, very, very good. She was all excited. But she played a person who transitioned, person transitioned, a male transitioned to a female, and the young girl from Italy, beautiful young woman, I’m not allowed to say that anymore politically, but I’ll say it, she was a beautiful young woman. If you say that, that’s the end of your career, right? But it’s not. If it is, so be it, okay? We’ve got to get back to real life. But this beautiful young lady is out, and she gets, boom, a little jab, left jab, and she goes back, “Oh my God, I’ve never been hit like that. This is just like a defensive.” Then he goes, the corner said, “You can take her!” So, they push her out. Boom, another one. And she says, “That’s enough, I can’t do it. I can’t take it.” I’ve never seen anything like it. So, we had two people that transitioned. Both people, shockingly, won the gold medal in their division. So, it’s crazy.

Audience (01:29:32):

Boo!

Donald Trump (01:29:32):

And if you look at weightlifting contests, they’re the best of all. For years and years and years ago, they put an eighth of a pound on one side of the barbell, an eighth of a pound on the other. And they can’t do it! And the record’s standing for 18 years, they just can’t do it. And then a guy comes along who never lifted before, and he puts a hundred pounds on, and he goes like this, like it’s nothing. It’s so demeaning to women. We’re not going to allow it to happen. It’s ending. No men playing in women’s sport.
(01:30:06)
And we will defend the Second Amendment, protect religious liberty, restore free speech, and we will secure our elections. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. We need hope. We need the American Dream back, don’t we? We’re going to have the American Dream. We’re going to have the American Dream, so every kid in your family is going to grow up and say, “I want to be like Elon Musk. I want to have $200 billion in cash. I’m going to be like Elon Musk.” Get to it. That’s the American Dream.
(01:30:44)
But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris, and we must stop her country-destroying radical left agenda once and for all. We cannot have it happen. So, you must get out and you must vote. Here in this incredible Commonwealth, we stand on the shoulders of generations of Pennsylvania patriots, who gave everything they could give, every single thing, for their rights and for their freedom. Pennsylvania is where our founding fathers declared American independence and sounded the beautiful Liberty Bell. It’s where the Army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge, where General George Washington led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware. And where generations of top, strong, beautiful miners and steelworkers put Pennsylvania spirit into every single thing they did.
(01:31:40)
And from Gettysburg to Germantown, and Philadelphia to Barren Hill, and from Brandywine to right here in Butler, this is the place where Pennsylvania patriots poured out their blood with the love of their country. They love their country so much. And so, in honor of all those American heroes who came before us, we will press forward, we will push onward, and together we will win, win, win. We’re going to win, win, win. Nothing will sway us, nothing will slow us, and no one will ever stop us. No matter what dangers come our way, no matter what obstacles we must face, we will keep striving toward our magnificent American future. We will not fail, we will not allow ourselves to fail.
(01:32:31)
From this day forward, we will always put America first, and we’ll take back and save the United States. November 5th, election day, will be the most important day in the history of our country. And together, with the great people of Pennsylvania, we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Pennsylvania. God bless you. God bless you, Pennsylvania.

From Detroit down to Houston, and New York to L.A. where there’s pride in every American heart, and it’s time we stand and say that I’m proud to be an American, where at least I know I’m free. And I won’t forget the men who died who gave that right to me. And I’d gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today because there ain’t no doubt I love this land. God bless the USA. And I’m proud to be an American, where at least I know I’m free. And I won’t forget the men who died who gave that right to me. And I’d gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today because there ain’t no doubt I love this land. God bless the USA.

Donald Trump (01:18):

Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, what a crowd.

Crowd (01:18):

USA!

Donald Trump (03:02):

Well, I want to thank everybody. There has never been spirit… We did great. As you know, in 2016, we did much better. In 2020, bad things happened there. But there’s never been spirit like we have for this one. Something’s going on that’s very special. I want to say hello, Pennsylvania. I’m thrilled to be back in this beautiful Commonwealth with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots.
(03:29)
Before we begin, I’d like to send my love and prayers to the families of those who have died, [inaudible 00:03:37] death, and all of those who are displaced and suffering in the wake of the hurricane’s destruction in the South, especially in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee. And in particular, Western North Carolina took a tremendous hit. It’s been absolutely devastated, and God be with you all. It’s been a rough one. That was a big monster hurricane and it hit a lot harder than anyone even thought possible, so we want to just extend our best wishes to everybody.
(04:16)
And Joe Biden is in Delaware sleeping right now in one of his many estates. One of his many estates. How did he get so many houses? He never was anything… He was a politician, made $151. What the hell was it all about? And that’s why lying Kamala Harris in San Francisco, a city that she’s totally destroyed, that’s the way she is right now at a fundraiser. I don’t know why fundraiser, they send her… They get so much money. A lot of people send money, I won’t tell you who, but people that you would not like very much. I could give you the names. I think I will release the names. But if I do that, they’ll say that I’m a threat to democracy. “He’s a threat.” You wouldn’t like the names.
(05:04)
They raise a lot of money from bad people, fundraising events with her radical left lunatic donors when big parts of our country have been devastated by that massive hurricane and is underwater with many, many people dead. She ought to be here, she ought to be down in the area where she should be. That’s what she’s getting paid for, right? That’s what she’s getting paid for. So he’s at home sleeping in one of his many estates, and she’s in San Francisco, which she destroyed, trying to raise more money. She ought to get out and do more interviews. That’s what she ought to do.
(05:42)
And I’m here in Erie, Pennsylvania with the workers who used to be Democrats, but now they’re all Trump Republicans because they know that Trump is going to take them to the Promised Land. We will. And by the way, so that you know, our polls are doing great, you saw that. We win Pennsylvania, we win; but honestly, we’re doing good everywhere. But we were at the Alabama-Georgia game yesterday. Did you see it? So just to show you, because this is a poll too, right? And I walked in, it must be my looks because the place went stone-cold crazy. Where is it? Put it up. We got to put it up.
(06:35)
It’s a great game. And that was a great game. Alabama got off to a really big start you would’ve said it was over and then Georgia came back. What a great game that was. Great players, a lot of future NFL players in that group, but it was really great. But the level of love and enthusiasm and… Tim Walz, you know who he is, right? I won’t say which, but he went to a game, they booed him out of the place. He wanted to go home early. He wanted to get out of there. That was not good. It was not a good environment.
(08:03)
But this is a poll. I mean, that’s a poll. It’s all a poll. You have thousands of people outside. We were in Wisconsin yesterday and except for the fact that the administration would not let us have the… We had 50,000, and maybe more people, and we were going to do an outdoor rally and we ended up having to do it inside in front of about 1,000 people. But we had 50,000 people that showed up, but they didn’t want me to be outside. They said they couldn’t get us enough people because they were guarding the United Nations and Iran. The president of Iran is here. But Iran is threatening my life and they’re guarding the president of Iran, and Biden doesn’t say anything. I’d say some… If that were me and I don’t care who the opponent was, I’d be letting him know you better not touch. You better not do anything.
(08:58)
So they’re guarding Iran and we had 50,000 people. It was the most incredible scene. Wisconsin, I think we’re going to do great in Wisconsin, but Rasmussen just came out with a big poll. We’re leading and we have a couple of them where we’re leading virtually in every swing state because people are tired of her act. We’re going to say some tough things today. People are tired of her act, her lying. She’s a liar and they’re tired of it. I think they would’ve been better off keeping sleepy Joe if you want to know the truth. I do.
(09:35)
Early voting is beginning and get underway. It’s all underway right now in Pennsylvania and Erie County is starting in the coming days. Erie County was known as a Democrat area until Trump came along and then they said, “What the hell?” Right, David? They said, “What the hell happened to Erie County?” Well, we love you. We’re the same people. You me, we’re the same. We need each and every one of you to make a plan to vote early and vote absentee, do whatever you want. The main thing is you got to get out and you got to vote. I really believe that if you look at this date and look at what’s happening to our country, I think November 5th will be the most important day potentially in the history of our country because our country’s going bad. It’s going bad. We have stupid people running it.
(10:32)
We also need you to find as many other new voters as you can. So go get them. We have some voters, they’re for us, but they’ve never voted and they’re going to want to vote. Just a little bit prodding. They’ll come out and they’ll vote. Our entire nation is counting on the people of the Commonwealth, and I know you will not let us down. You’re not going to let us down. We’re going to have a tremendous vote. We’re leading by a lot in Pennsylvania. But I mean like a thing like fracking her whole life, “You’ll never frack. Never frack. There will be no petroleum product.” We’re going to go to wind. Everything’s going to be wind. Even if it’s not windy, then we’ll suffer for a couple of days. Well, about 90% of the year we’re going to wind. We’re going to lots of different things. They haven’t worked anywhere else in the world, but we’re going anywhere.
(11:33)
There’s no way she fracks her whole life… So she has 15 policies and over the last year and a half, every single one of them, she changed to the exact opposite like taking prisoners and giving them sex change operation, she’s totally in favor. That’s what she wants. That’s one of the more men playing in women’s sports. Who would want that? Frankly, the worst of all, and to me, the most ridiculous or almost most ridiculous, open borders. Let everyone come in to our country and destroy it. But if we win in Pennsylvania, we will win the whole thing. We’re going to win and we’re going to turn our country around. We’re going to turn our country around, right? David, we are going to turn our country around. We’re going to turn around fast.

Crowd (12:44):

Trump!

Donald Trump (12:48):

And vote for that man right there. He is a great man. David McCormick, Senator. Bob Casey does nothing. He doesn’t do… I was there four years. I don’t know if I ever met the guys. He just votes along. Whoever’s on the radical left, he votes. It’s not your guy. David’s been there a long time. His father was there. He was there. You got to get somebody that’s got energy. He’s a low-energy person. Remember the last time I said that? That family has never spoken to me again. 37 days from now, we’re going to win this Commonwealth. We’re going to defeat lying Kamala Harris, and we will make America great again. We will do that.
(13:39)
And this is the most important election. I think it’s going to be the most important election of them all. I mean, they had some pretty good ones, right? Long time ago, they had some pretty good ones, but this is… I thought that 2016 was the most, and I’d say that this is the most important because the border was bad and then we fixed it 100%. It was so good, and then these guys took over and they destroyed it quickly. They got rid of little things like Remain in Mexico, things like not easy to get, remain… When I told the president of Mexico everybody’s staying in Mexico, “No, we wouldn’t do that.” I said, “Yes, you will, because if you don’t, we’re going to tear off your cars at 150% and that’s going to be the end of that. Sir, we’d love to do that. We’d love to keep everybody…”
(14:26)
We had hundreds of thousands of people… Tijuana was probably the fastest growing place on the planet. You ended up with half a million people there from a little town where you get a nice little drink, a half a million people, they couldn’t get into the country. They wouldn’t come in. Mexico was great, but I used tariffs in order to get that, but it was very important. As soon as they came in, they let the people just pour in. So it is so sad and we’re going to discuss that. If Kamala Harris gets four more years, America as we know it will absolutely be destroyed. You’ll have not 21 or 25, whatever it may be. Nobody has any idea. They have no idea. They like to say 12, 14, 13, it’s 21. It probably could be 31, could be a lot more than that. They have no idea, they’re pouring in.
(15:22)
Kamala is openly acknowledged to be the worst vice president in history. And as president, she would be much worse than that. She would be a disaster. I mean, they asked her… Did anybody see the Oprah interview? Oprah wanted to climb under the table. She couldn’t… The whole thing is crazy. Two days ago, for the first time ever, the patriots of ICE this is the first time ever where they released murder numbers and rape numbers and human trafficking numbers. They never do that. They talk about overall nice and gently, but somebody felt that these numbers should be released and they came out actually just as she got to the border. It was very interesting. This was a little tough because she gets up and she goes, “Well, I didn’t really get involved too much with the border, but I’m going to now get involved.”
(16:17)
Why didn’t she do it almost four years ago? Why didn’t she do it? Because she can’t do it. She can’t do it. Number one, she doesn’t have the capability. Number two, her base will not let her do it. For whatever reason that is, you have to explain that. But new data came out and the massive number of savage criminal aliens that Kamala Harris has allowed to invade our country… This is an invasion and these people are mean, tough… She had a total… Listen to this. These numbers just came out. And I’ve been saying it for a long time, because we are the party of common sense. I knew that once they had open borders, all of the countries, I didn’t think about all over the world, I thought in South America, it’s all over the world. Last week, a lot of people came in from the Congo, a big prison in the Congo in Africa. Welcome to the United States.
(17:14)
They came in from the Congo. They come in from South America. They come in from Asia. They come in from all over the world. They come in from all over the world. The Middle East. You got to see from Yemen, they’re coming in. We have more terrorists come into our country in the last two and a half years than we’ve ever seen. I had one year where border patrol said no terrorists came in. I had another year where they said 11 came in. Thousands of terrorists are pouring into our country now. Thousands. And they’re coming into our cities and our small towns here in Pennsylvania and all over the country. These towns are petrified. Even if they’re not there yet, they will be there because you have millions of people we’re dealing with. This is not sustainable by any country in total.
(18:09)
Listen to these numbers though. These are the official numbers. These are certified numbers. Can you believe it? This isn’t her with her bullshit. In total… She’s a liar. In total during her term, it’s not even believable, she let in 13,099 convicted murderers. Some of them had murdered 10 people, some murdered seven, one murdered six. I’m looking at these. These are stone-cold killers, and they let in people that are worse than any criminal we have. The only thing nice about it is they make our criminals look extremely soft and nice. And remember these people, remember her and sleepy Joe saying, “No, the people that we bring in, they don’t create crime.” I’m saying are they kidding? I’m going to show you a video that I have that you’re going to see in a couple of seconds. It’s brutal. One guy talking to a judge, “I will kill you.”
(19:24)
These are brutal people. These are the people that we don’t want. We all have big hearts and all that stuff. She let in 25,272 illegal aliens convicted of rape and other sex crimes, viciously raping. And 62,231 criminal aliens convicted of violent assault where people are just about dead, but they didn’t die, but we took them in too. In total, she let in, listen to these numbers, 647,572 migrant criminals of the worst order. They call them of the worst order. I wonder what that means. Charged with or convicted with heinous crimes including child predators, drug dealers, vicious gang members, sadist thugs, and people that deal in women, people that take women and they sell women and they bring them across the border. Mostly women, children also, but mostly women. And they’re all living in our country right now. And we’ve had many killings, Rachel Morin, so many people have died. But wait till you see what’s going to happen.
(20:41)
Oh, and if I don’t get in, it’s going to be the worst thing that this country has ever suffered because they won’t do a damn thing about it. And the number of 21 or 25 or whatever million it is, you’ll have 150, 200 million coming. This country will no longer be recognizable. It’s already close to that, and we’re going to get it taken care of. And I just say this to all rapists, drug dealers, human traffickers and murderers, welcome to America. It is important that you send a thank-you note to lying Kamala Harris because without her, you would not be here. But we don’t want you here and you’re going to get the hell out. Very soon, we’re getting you out.
(21:46)
When just one convicted murderer escapes from prison, in real life, we have one person will escape who’s not nearly as bad as the people we’re letting in, he’s a perfect person compared to the people we’re letting in, you’ll see that in a second. But if somebody escapes, we have a massive manhunt and we look all over the place and we got everything and the w… And we have 13,099 that just came in. We have massive manhunts. It’s all over the place and they capture them. But now we have 13,099, that’s just the murderers, and over 600, 000 highest-level criminals in our country. Kamala let in the 13,099 convicted murderers and opposes all efforts to find them and to remove them. She opposes all these efforts because, look, she’s a communist. You know that. I used to say Marxist, but unfortunately nobody knows what that is. Most people said, “What’s a Marxist? Is that a good thing or a bad?” I said I have to use the word communist, okay? Does anybody mind.

Crowd (23:03):

No.

Donald Trump (23:04):

And by the way, they’re close enough. Remember I used to say our country will never be a socialist country, and I turned out to be right. They skipped socialism. They went right down to communism. So I was right. See, because I’m right about everything, right? Trump is right about everything. They skipped socialism. Normally they go from socialism to communism. No, they skipped socialism. Kamala Harris can never be forgiven for erasing our border, and she must never be allowed to become president of the United States. She’ll destroy… She’s a radical left lunatic. And one of the reasons I’m angry, yesterday, she made a speech like everything on the border is good and she’s going to fix the border. Did you see that crazy speech? “And I’m going to fix the border because I was a prosecutor.” You know who she prosecuted? Mostly her political opponents like me. But how am I doing? I’m doing pretty good, right?
(24:11)
She actually had a terrible record as a prosecutor. And you know who she went after more than anybody? African Americans. They hate her. And she destroyed San Francisco. But what she’s done is a total disqualifier. She should be disqualified. She should resign the vice presidency and go home to California, which she is by… She’s really destroyed it. But she should go home in disgrace. What Kamala has done with illegal migrants is the biggest crime story of our time because hundreds of thousands of people are going to be victims very shortly. It’s happening. We had many of them. Yesterday, we had this incredible event. We had many of the parents of victims at the event. We had one or two that spoke… I mean, it’s impossible almost for them. Their lives are destroyed just so you understand. Their daughters were killed, their lives are destroyed, their sons are killed. And they were killed by migrants that came in illegally that were so vicious like you’ve never seen before.
(25:23)
Already hundreds of people have been murdered because of her action at the border. And thousands more will follow in rapid succession. She should be impeached and prosecuted for her actions. And these killers are stone-cold monsters and have so little heart. They have no heart. They really have no heart. They’re worse than anything you can see on television. You look at the mob pictures, the gangster pictures, the drug dealer pictures, these people are far worse. There’s nobody in Hollywood like this. You can’t get people like this. You’ll see that in a second. And they don’t care when or who they kill. They wake up the following morning, they don’t ever remember. So it’s just a routine part of life. And they’re in our country now. They don’t even think about it. These are rough, vicious, rougher than anything you can imagine.
(26:27)
And I say it all the time. If you wanted to do a movie on some of these people that you’re going to be looking at in two minutes, if you wanted to do a movie, there’s no actor in Hollywood that could play their role. There’s nobody that could do it. These actors, they’re a little bit shaky. They can’t play the role. They’ll bring in a big actor and you look, you say, “Oh, he’s got no muscle content. He’s got no muscle. We need a little muscle.” Then they bring in another one. “But he’s got a weak face. He looks weak.” Now these guys have the whole package, unfortunately for our country. I watched one of them shouting at a judge, “I kill you. I kill you when I get out. I kill you.” And the judge, he’s never heard this stuff. And even the guards, they want to look for a new job themselves. “I kill you.” But it’s all because Kamala let these people in. Let’s take a look at this. You’ll find it very interesting.

Video (27:31):

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, please step out of the hallway.
(27:33)
[inaudible 00:27:35] break up soon and I’ll kill more. The only thing I regret is I killed two. I wish I can kill more of those mother fuckers. Kill more [inaudible 00:27:52]

Attempt of murder.

Donald Trump (28:09):

Central casting, Mr. Wall. Stand up, Mr. Wall. I love this guy’s outfit. I got to buy… Are they for sale? I want to buy one. I built hundreds of miles of wall. I’m going to buy one of those and come out here. I built hundreds of miles of wall and it worked, and I was going to add another 200 miles and then we had a very disruptive election. Horrible thing happened. Horrible, horrible. Including in this state we wanted in 2016 easily. And then in this state, bad things happened because I love you and you love me. We did so good here.

Crowd (28:58):

You won.

Donald Trump (28:59):

But you know

Donald Trump (29:00):

You know what? I built hundreds of miles of wall and I’m going to walk onto this platform someday at some place and I’m going to wear that ugly, horrible suit because it’s emblematic. It’s emblematic of what we’ve done, right? That’s a great guy. He must’ve been to 250… Do you have any idea how many you’ve come to?

Crowd (29:25):

[inaudible 00:29:26]-

Donald Trump (29:26):

Hundreds. Hundreds. And he’s a very successful guy. You believe it. It’s like they go to football games and they got the name… A top guy in a law firm or a top CPA, but on Sunday or Saturday goes to football and they have the name of the player on the back. I mean, who would do that? But they do that. I wouldn’t do that. Just out of pride. I’m not going to do that. We want to keep our own name on our back, right?

Crowd (29:50):

Yes, sir.

Donald Trump (29:51):

But he’s been a great guy. I’ll bet he’s gone to 250 rallies. You may have the record, right? Or do we have the ladies from North Carolina? We have the front row Joes. Where’s the front row Joes? Look at this. Look at these guys. Look at these front row Joes, but we have a great time with a horrible subject. Think how it will be when we fix it. We will really have a great time because we’re going to fix it and we’re going to fix it [inaudible 00:30:18].
(30:20)
But these people are very much like how the Democrats are and the way they cheat in elections. They have absolutely no shame. These criminals are the way the Democrats are. They have no shame whatsoever. They cheat and it’s almost like routine for them. It doesn’t bother them at all. Kamala Harris lies about everything, and that’s why they call her Lyin’ Kamala, L-Y-I-N apostrophe. Lyin’. Lyin’. She’s a liar. She lies about everything. She makes up stories about me, but yesterday, really, she said, I ripped babies out of a crib. Donald Trump ripped… I ripped babies. I said, “Where did she get that one?” Every day. It’s a new story. Now, if I’m a person that’s not really into knowing who Trump is, I would say he’s a terrible guy. He rips babies out of a crib. Remember when they blamed me for building cages to put kids in and then somebody from Border Patrol said, “I’m sorry, that was two years before President Trump came into office.” That was done by Barack Hussein Obama, right? That was Barack Hussein Obama. Remember that?
(31:41)
I went through two weeks of hell and then finally somebody spoke up and said… I said, “I never built those things, and then it was Obama that built them,” so it took a little time. Did I get an apology from the fake news? Oh, that’s a lot of fake news. Did I get an apology from the fake news? No. Did I get an apology from 60 Minutes when I said that the laptop from hell had nothing to do with Russia? It was done by Hunter. Did I get an apology from 60 Minutes? No. Remember that? She was fighting me. “This was from Russia.” I said, “This was not from Russia.” I won’t tell you what the pictures were. They were not good. They never got into the real pictures. Did they? If it was me, they would’ve gotten into the real pictures real fast. They didn’t get into those pictures.
(32:36)
She makes up stories about everything, including herself like… I always get criticized because they agree that up to it. But why would I bring it up so much? Because it’s so simple. It’s not a horrible plot. It’s not a complex thing that people get bored with Uncle Sam. It’s just basic. She said she worked so hard, she sweated over french fries at McDonald’s and she never worked there. It turned out to be a lie-

Crowd (33:06):

Liar!

Donald Trump (33:06):

… and the fake news doesn’t want to talk about it. Although I heard a major news newspaper is doing a big story on it. It’s a lie. It’s a total lie. She never worked at McDonald’s, but she lies about everything and we can’t let her get into office, and that’s why I’m a little bit rougher than I would normally be.
(33:25)
We started off with Crooked Joe Biden, and they kept him in a basement. They got lucky because of the horrible Covid situation. We did an amazing job with Covid. I got credit for the economy. I got credit for the military. We took out ISIS, we rebuilt them. I got a lot of credit. Space Force never got credit, and what we did was amazing. Nobody knew what it was. What we did was amazing with all of the things that we did were amazing actually. But when he came in and then he comes along and he stops, and all of a sudden you realize, and now we got him as a president, and the wall stopped and everything stopped and people started coming in. Oh, is my favorite of all time, my favorite graph. In fact, my favorite document of all time, and I have some good ones. There is never a document like this. Do you have? They don’t even know I’m going to be asking for this. This reminds me, oh, they’re unbelievable. No, they didn’t even know. That’s my favorite document. That document saved my life. Immigration saved my life. Without that document, I would not be here. Without that document, I wouldn’t be talking to you.

Crowd (34:54):

Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump-

Donald Trump (35:01):

Without that document we’re not here.

Crowd (35:03):

… Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump-

Donald Trump (35:06):

Because that document’s always on my left. It’s always on my left. It’s always at the end of the speech, not the beginning. And I had it on my right because I don’t use a teleprompter that much. Just pieces.
(35:18)
By the way, I said this the other day, isn’t it nice to have a president that doesn’t need to use a teleprompter, isn’t it, Uncle Sam? Isn’t that nice? Isn’t it really nice? But they do keep you out of a lot of trouble. You just read the line. I was watching her the other day. Bah, bah, bah, bah. Keeps you out of trouble because she can’t answer a question.
(35:45)
So this document turned out, at the beginning, think of that. What are the chances that it’s at the beginning and never did it at the beginning. Right at the beginning, and it’s on my right instead of my left, I was looking just at the right angle. Ping. I love that document. I sleep with that document every night. I kiss that document, love that document. But what the document says, now that we get back to order, what the document says is that that was the lowest point. The arrow at the bottom, that was the lowest point of illegal immigration in the history of our country. It’s the lowest point that we’ve ever had. We had it going good. That included drugs and that included trafficking of women and trafficking of children. We had it going and all they had to do is leave it. And they came in and they terminated everything.
(36:32)
Sanctions, they terminated, remain in Mexico. They terminated every single thing and they ended up with… Look what happened. It was like a rocket ship, what’s gone on. And then we found out on top of everything, I don’t think they knew it at that time. They had flights coming in from all over different parts of the world. Flights, big, beautiful airplanes loaded up with migrants flying over the border. So they really did want people to come in. Now she says, “Well, I did good job, but we’re going to do a good job.” Why hasn’t she done it? My expression with her the number… You can say every word she utters. Why haven’t you done it? She goes, we’re going to do this and we’re going to do that. She’s there for almost four years, and I just keep saying-

Crowd (37:21):

[inaudible 00:37:22].

Donald Trump (37:22):

… why I did it during the debate, I killed her in the debate. But I have crooked people. What they do, I had three on one. I didn’t even mind that I still won by a lot. But why? And David Muir, how about him?

Crowd (37:43):

Boo!

Donald Trump (37:45):

How about that guy? Pretty boy. We call him pretty boy. That’s about it. That’s about all. But you know what I said, crime is at a level we’ve never seen. It’s rampant. It’s rising. Okay? He interrupts me, “I’m sorry, sir. Crime in this country has gone down.” I said, without looking at numbers, is there anybody in this room that think that crime has gone down? It’s gone through the roof and largely because of migrant crime. It’s not only that in New York, you can’t walk into a drug store now, it’s like you’re in a prison of glass. If you want to buy aspirin, you have to wait 45 minutes for a clerk to come up and open. And every drug store, I just lost one. I had a nice tenant. I just lost a tenant, had a beautiful tenant at 40 Wall Street. I just lost a tenant. They opened a big chain drug store, big beautiful chain. They opened. They were doing such great business, 40 Wall Street right across from the stock exchange. They gave me notice. They said, “We’re going to have to close because the shelves… The people walk in, they just take everything they want. They walk out of the store.” What the hell is going on?
(38:58)
See, we have to let the police do their job and if they have to be extraordinarily rough… The funny thing with all of that stuff, look at the department store, same thing. You see these guys walking out with air conditioners, with the refrigerators on their back, the craziest thing, and the police aren’t allowed to do their job. They’re told, If you do anything, you’re going to lose your pension. You’re going to lose your family, your house, your car.” The police want do it. The border patrol wants to do it. Border patrol, they’re incredible. They want to do it. They’re not allowed to do it because the liberal left won’t let them do it. The liberal left wants to destroy them, and they want to destroy our country. If you had one day, like one real rough, nasty day with the drug stores, as an example, where when they start walking out with…
(39:50)
She created something in San Francisco. $950 you’re allowed to steal. Anything above that, you will be prosecuted. Well, it works out that the 950 is a misnomer because you can steal whatever you want. You can go way above. But originally you saw kids walk in with calculators. They were calculators. They didn’t want to go over the $950. They’re standing with calculators, adding it up. These are smart people. They’re not so stupid, but they have to be taught. Now, if you had one really violent day… Like a guy like Mike Kelly put him in charge. Congressman Kelly put him in charge for one day. He’s right here. He’s a great congressman. Would you say, Mike, that if you were in charge, you would say, “Oh, please don’t touch them. Don’t touch them. Let them rob your store.” All these stores go out of business, right? They don’t pay rent. The city doesn’t have [inaudible 00:40:49]. It’s a chain of events. It’s so bad. One rough hour and I mean real rough. The word will get out and it will end immediately. End immediately. It’ll end immediately. Crooked Joe Biden became mentally impaired, sad. But Lyin’ Kamala Harris, honestly, I believe she was born that way. There’s something wrong with Kamala and I just don’t know what it is, but there is definitely something missing. And you know what? Everybody knows it.

Turn that off. I know the importance of safety and security, especially at our border.
(41:58)
Who really is Kamala Harris? She’s been telling us her entire career.
(42:06)
I support our sanctuary law. The illegal immigrant deported multiple times, who stands accused of killing Kate Steinle. An undocumented immigrant is not a criminal. And we must also have the courage to reject that term “illegal alien”. Are you aware that there’s a perception?
(42:25)
[inaudible 00:42:27].
(42:25)
Are you aware that there’s a perception?
(42:27)
That puts ICE in the same category as the KKK? Is that what you’re asking me?
(42:31)
Abolish ICE.
(42:33)
Yeah.
(42:33)
Is that a position that you agree with?
(42:35)
And we need to probably think about starting from scratch. We’re not going to treat people who are undocumented, cross-border criminals. I’m opposed to any policy that would deny any human being public health, period.
(42:49)
Would you be committing to close immigration detention centers?
(42:53)
Absolutely. On day one.
(42:53)
[inaudible 00:42:58] she has applied consequences last three and a half years. 10 million legal encounters, two million got [inaudible 00:43:04]. 600% increase in sex trafficking, more terrorists coming across the border. A record number of people off the terrorist watch list, and over a quarter million Americans dead from fentanyl. All that comes across [inaudible 00:43:15]. Consequences. There ought to be consequences for her failure.
(43:16)
We have a secure border. The border is secure.

Sickening new details about the murder of Georgia nursing student, Laken Riley. The 22-year-old was beaten to death with a mystery object.

Thank you very much.

Crowd (44:00):

… we need Trump!

Donald Trump (44:03):

And honestly, we could give you clips like that all day long. This is not your president. This president would destroy our country worse than Biden. He’s the worst president in history. She would be worse. Every day, Kamala is using migrant flights in her phone app. Think of this. They’re using a phone app where the migrants are allowed to phone them in so they find out how… But it’s really who really uses it? The cartels use it. The cartels use it because they pay off everybody, are crooked people, they pay them off. They have a phone app. Where’s the best place to drop the people? But they want to flood up. Pennsylvania in particular, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and the entire Midwest with thousands of migrants from the most dangerous countries on earth, destroying the character of small towns and leaving local communities in anguish and in despair. Pennsylvania is not going to take it anymore. I don’t think you’re going to take it anymore. I don’t think so.
(45:10)
As just an example, the beautiful 4,000 person town of Charleroi… Do you know Charleroi, Pennsylvania? Yes, beautiful.

Crowd (45:20):

[inaudible 00:45:23].

Donald Trump (45:23):

It was beautiful. Lots of luck, Charleroi. I love you very much, but you get in… Charleroi will be beautiful again. But right now it’s not so good. It’s seen a 2000% increase in the population of illegal immigrants under the borders of Harris. So it’s population it.

Crowd (45:42):

Boo! Boo!

Donald Trump (45:43):

This a little town. No crime, no problem. Nice place to live. No problems. It just had a 2000%, 2000% increase in population with people just like we’re showing you today. Our country is being turned into a dumping ground for the world.

Crowd (46:02):

Boo!

Donald Trump (46:03):

We have no choice. The people that Kamala Harris has illegally imported have to go back to places from which they came. They have to go back. They have to go back.
(46:18)
In August, an illegal alien who Kamala Harris released into our country, despite the fact that he was a convicted murderer and sex offender. Other than that, he was quite a nice gentleman. He was from El Salvador killed a West Virginia, mother of two. Killed her. Viciously, killed her. Didn’t even think it was a bad thing. He didn’t even think it was that bad. Only days ago, right here in Pennsylvania, an illegal alien ran over 23-year-old musician with his car-

Crowd (46:51):

[inaudible 00:46:53].

Donald Trump (46:52):

… and did it on purpose. And in New York, an illegal alien brutally murdered a woman in front of her children and enjoyed doing it. If Kamala Harris wins this election, she will overwhelm Pennsylvania cities and towns with illegal immigrants and migrants and Pennsylvania will never ever be the same.

Crowd (47:11):

[inaudible 00:47:12].

Donald Trump (47:12):

I went to school here. I love this place. I know it. It’s so different. What’s happening to your beautiful place? No. I went to school here and I loved it. I always loved it. But what’s happening? What’s happening is so different. Kamala is so radical. She even wants to legalize fentanyl. She wants fentanyl to come in. When one little drop, one little drop can destroy you, which is pouring… It’s pouring across our borders at record levels, at levels that you’ve never seen before, I mean everybody I know, they have family members that are dying, mostly children and many of them not even looking for drugs. They have something else where it’s something that… and it’s laced with fentanyl and they end up dying, a vicious death by the way. I brought something, the snake. Does anybody want to hear it? We don’t have to do it. If you want to get back, should we do the snake or not? Should we, David, do… We got to get that guy in office? Should we do it?

Crowd (48:17):

Snake, snake, snake, snake, snake-

Donald Trump (48:23):

It’s so apropos, right? Should we do it? Anyone see the snake? But it’s true. It’s just so bad. But it is apropos, isn’t it? Who has not heard the snake? Who has heard the snake? And they don’t care, they want to hear it again. Let’s do it. This is about the border, essentially. It was an old song and little rewording and things, but it was very, very apropos and I think very good in a lot of ways. Got to learn your lesson.
(49:06)
On her way to work, one morning down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor half-frozen snake.
(49:19)
His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. “Poor thing,” she cried. “I’ll take you in and I’ll take care of you.”
(49:29)
” Take me in, oh, tender woman. Take me in for heaven’s sake. Take me in, oh tender woman,” sighed the vicious snake.
(49:38)
She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk and laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk.
(49:46)
She hurried home from work that night and soon as she arrived, she found the pretty snake she’d taken in had been revived.
(49:55)
“Take me in, oh tender woman. Take me in for heaven’s sake. Take me in, oh tender woman,” sighed the vicious snake.
(50:04)
She [inaudible 00:50:06] him to her bosom. “You’re so beautiful, ” She cried. “But if I hadn’t brought you in by now, you truly would’ve died.”
(50:17)
She stroked his pretty skin again and kissed and held him tight. But instead of saying, “Thank you, ma’am,” the snake gave her a vicious bite.
(50:29)
” Take me in, oh tender woman. Take me in for heaven’s sake. Take me in, oh tender woman,” sighed the vicious snake.
(50:38)
“I saved you,” cried the woman, “and you’ve bitten me. But why? You know your bite is poisonous and now I’m going to die.”
(50:51)
“Shut up, silly woman,” said the reptile with a grin. “You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.”
(51:06)
That’s what’s happening on our border. That’s what’s happening on our border. I mean, we can get a PhD in whatever it is from the best school in the world is not going to be more accurate than that. When you look at that guy up there talking to the judge, “I kill you. I kill you. I kill you.” Oh, he wanted to kill him. He will. If he gets out, he’ll kill him, 100%. But you have to know. But this is what we’re bringing into our beautiful country, our beautiful USA. This is what we’re bringing, but we’re bringing them in at levels that nobody’s ever seen. And we’re doing it by stupid people like Kamala. She’s a stupid person. Stupid person. I don’t care. I don’t.

Donald Trump (52:29):

As soon as I take office, I will stop all migrant flights to Pennsylvania and every other state. I will shut down all entries through Kamala’s migrant phone app. If you can believe they have an app. They have a phone app. I called [inaudible 00:52:44]. Can you believe this? I will end immediately, catch and release. So I had catch and release too, but you know where I release them? In Mexico. I have catch and release too. But I released them in Mexico. Their catch and release was to catch them, even if they were a criminal, immediately they released them into our country. I release him into Mexico. I will end all sanctuary cities all over our country immediately. And I will restore, Remain in Mexico. It’s called Remain in Mexico. And it wasn’t easy to get. I had a fight like hell with the Mexican government and the president, a good man. But I had to fight like hell when I told him I want everybody to stay in Mexico. He laughed at me. He laughed. He said, “What? Why would we do that?”
(53:35)
I said, “You’re going to do it. No, no, you’re going to do it. No, but we can’t do that.” I said, “You’re going to do it. And if you don’t do it, we’re putting this massive tariff on everything you sell into our country, including all the cars you saw. And we’ll make an absolute fortune on you. All right?”
(53:55)
And he said, “It would be my great honor to do everything that you’d like to do. Please don’t put those tariffs on me. Please. I beg you. Don’t put the tariffs.”
(54:09)
I will send in the federal law enforcement to liberate every Pennsylvania town and every town in the United States of America that has been taken over by migrant gangs and thugs and criminal aliens.
(54:29)
Another front in Kamala’s war on Pennsylvania’s way of life is her war on energy. She was always against fossil fuels. She was born that way. You don’t change. She just changed because her poll numbers were bad. You don’t change. I’m the only guy this happens to. So I have the debate. Biden goes way down. He’s down 21 points, I think. I’m leading by 21 points. The election’s over. Crazy Nancy Pelosi. She’s crazy as her bedbug.
(54:55)
Oh, by the way, by the way, by the way, Visa, right? Did you see? Visa, she owned a lot of Visa and the Justice Department brought suit against Visa. A vicious big, a terrible suit. And she sold all of her stock the day before the suit was brought. She owned it for years. She’s crooked. We offered her 10,000 soldiers or National Guard, and she knew that. And she actually admitted it on her daughter’s documentary. She’s a documentarian. I don’t think Nancy’s too happy about that. She said it was her fault. It was her total responsibility. I couldn’t believe the daughter released the tapes, but they weren’t really released. They were gotten, somehow. Somebody gave them and she took total responsibility. J6. Nancy Pelosi said she turned down thousands of troops. National Guard. Now you didn’t need thousands. You didn’t need 10,000. I offered 10,000 or more because I felt it was going to be a very big day. Everybody was talking about it. But she turned them down. If she would’ve had 200, 300, 400, January 6th would not have existed as we knew it. Now, think of it. And she’s right on tape. “This is my fault. This is my responsibility. I can’t believe this has happened.” And then they try and blame me for it. I offered them 10,000 troops, whatever you need, a few days before, because I said, there’s going to be a lot of people here.
(56:40)
If Kamala is reelected, her green news scam will obliterate the economy of your commonwealth, obliterate it. All stupid stuff. It also caused a lot of inflation between the energy policies and everything else they did. But the crazy spending green new scam. It used to be called the Green New Deal, now we call it…
(57:01)
Do you ever notice this was such a big deal, the environmental stuff? I haven’t heard the environmental stuff mentioned in six months. I was saying the other night, what the hell happened to the environment? David, will you figure this out? David McCormick, everybody vote for him. David, will you figure this out? No, but think about this. Mike, they don’t ever talk about the environment anymore. You know why? Mike is saying, “Don’t talk about it now.” No, it’s one of the great scams of all time. You know why they don’t talk about it? Because people aren’t buying it anymore. I don’t want to use bad language. My wife said, “Please don’t use bad language.” You know who said that? Right. The great son of the legendary Billy Graham, Franklin

Donald Trump (58:01):

[inaudible 00:58:00]. He said, “Sir, you are one of the greatest storytellers I’ve ever heard, but I listened to your rally the other night. You wrote me a beautiful letter and your stories would even be better if you didn’t use foul language.” And I respect Franklin. I love Franklin. Franklin is a great guy. He really does a good job. I took that letter. I said, “Gee.” Then I said, “Okay, I won’t use certain words,” but when you don’t use those certain little keywords like bullshit, there’s no other word. No, I’m trying to find… There’s no other word. I mean, I don’t use really bad words, but for emphasis…. I tried it one time and it wasn’t pretty. Instead of that word I said, “And it’s not true,” and people are looking like falling asleep.
(59:07)
But when I win, we will get Pennsylvania energy workers fracking, drilling, pumping and producing like they have never produced before. Lyin’ Kamala vowed to repeatedly ban fracking and she imposed a natural gas export ban. That was a killer that is starving your state right now of your wealth and wealth that you deserve right now. She imposed a ban on the natural gas. Very bad. People don’t even talk about it. Her insane electric vehicle mandate. This is where everybody’s going to have an electric car within a very short period of time, but maybe not everybody wants an electric car. And we love Elon. I love Elon. He endorsed me, gave me the strongest endorsement, and his Tesla is great, but he understands this and he never wants…
(01:00:03)
Somebody said, “Does Elon ever speak to you about the electric?” I said, “Never spoke to him about it.” He never called me and said, “What the hell are you doing here?” because he understands. He’s got a great market. It might be seven or 8%, but they’re trying to have everyone 100%. Number one, they’re made in China for the most part. They will all be made. The auto workers are now… You saw the Teamsters overwhelmingly supported me. You saw that. And the auto workers are overwhelmingly supporting me. It’s pretty amazing.
(01:00:34)
But the insane electric vehicle mandate, they want everybody to have an electric car, but they don’t go far. They cost much more. There are a lot of problems, and they don’t work well. In Iowa, it was 20 degrees below zero and I always heard the cars don’t work well in the cold. And I had a big night in Iowa. I won that whole primary thing. We won by numbers that nobody’s seen before. So I remembered very vividly and I’m driving there and there are cars all over the road. I said, “What the hell is…” Goes, “Sir, they’re electric cars and they don’t work in cold weather.” I said, “Oh, that sounds like a bad idea.” No, there are a lot of problems, but there are a lot of… Some people want them, they’re great. Other people don’t, but you have to have your choice. If you want a gasoline-propelled car, if you want to have a hybrid, you should have it. You should be able to have it.
(01:01:27)
The new thing is hydrogen. They have hydrogen cars. They have one problem. On occasion, it will blow up, and when it blows up, you are not recognizable. No, you’re not even recognizable. This is like a massive bomb being dropped. When it blows up, you are no longer… Your wife cannot identify you. Let me put it that way. “Is this your husband?” They show you blood. “Is this your husband?” “I really can’t tell.” No. So that’s a problem they’re going to have to work out, I think. But they say that’s the new up and coming thing. So far, I’m not interested.
(01:02:01)
Her insane electric vehicle mandate will decimate Pennsylvania’s economy by abolishing gas-powered cars and trucks for American roads and destroying your fossil fuel industry. And there’s very few states that benefit like you do from fracking. I mean, you have 500,000 jobs. And if she gets it, she’s going to just edit. She’s a liar. Remember, again, McDonald’s, just put it in your mind. It’s so simple. I don’t have to go through a long story. She said she worked there. She’s a liar. That’s why we’re calling her L-Y-I-N apostrophe.
(01:02:43)
And thanks to her green new Scam, your electricity prices are up in Pennsylvania 62% since she took office and are slated to be increased this year by more than 30%. Congratulations. If and when we win, everyone says, “Sir, sir.” Say, if they didn’t cheat, I wouldn’t even be here today. You know why? I wouldn’t have to campaign. I’m here only because they cheat, and they cheat in this state, especially in Philadelphia, and I’ve mentioned a couple of the areas, but for the most part, but Philadelphia is out of control. Detroit is out of control. Atlanta is out of control. Places are out of control. Out of control. Because if there was no cheating, if God came down from a high and said, “I am going to be your vote tabulator for this election,” I would leave this podium right now because I wouldn’t have to speak. We wouldn’t have any problem. We have to have a landslide because they cheat so damn much. We have to have a landslide. Right Mike?
(01:03:55)
So I never say when I win. We’re leading in all the polls. We’re leading the state. But I say if and when because I don’t want to be obnoxious and I don’t want to be foolish either. But if and when we’re leading big, I win, I will cut… Too big to rig. You’re right. We want to make it too big to rig.
(01:04:22)
But here’s a big promise to Pennsylvania and to whole country by the way, because your prices are really high. I mean, for people with all of that power, all of that liquid gold under your feet, you’re getting screwed. You’re paying high. You’re paying one of the highest energy rates, including cars, air conditioners, heating, you’re paying one of the highest in the whole country. Perhaps your governor’s not doing a very good job. I don’t know what the hell’s going on. But when you have that kind of energy, you shouldn’t be paying the… But you’re one of the highest.
(01:04:58)
But here’s a promise I’m making to you. I will cut your energy and electricity prices in half, 50%, five, O, within 12 months of taking the oath of our… Within 12 months, within 12 months of taking the oath of office, I will cut your energy prices by 50%, and it’s not going to be hard and I will terminate the natural gas export ban. Can you imagine we have a ban? We have countries that want pay us. We were energy independent four years ago, now we’re not. But more importantly, we were going to be energy dominant. I would’ve been producing today three to four times what I was doing four years ago. I will repeal the insane electric vehicle mandate and we will drill, baby, drill, those two things very early, drill, baby, drill. Thank you.
(01:05:59)
And earlier this month, I was honored to receive the endorsement, as I said just a little while ago, but I got the endorsement from the rank and file membership of the Teamsters. So it was a great honor. I’ve used in New York. It’s a very union town. And I used the Teamsters for years. They were great. They drove the cement trucks where I poured the concrete frames, and I did it for many years. A lot of buildings, built many buildings, many, many buildings. And Teamsters, and I got along with them great, but I got 60% of the vote. Actually, I think more than that, but 60% of the vote. And some local chapters, we did even better in Pennsylvania. We got 65% of the vote from the Teamsters. Wow, thank you very much. I love the… Are there any Teamsters? Any Teamsters in the room? Good. Stand up, sir. He’s a tough-looking guy. Very good. Good, thank you.
(01:06:59)
And as a result of this, shocking. To me, it’s not shocking, but as a result, the national organization, as you know, has refused to endorse the Democrat candidate for president for the first time in decades. I mean, it’s been a long time. And I want to thank Teamsters president Sean O’Brien and all of the incredible rank and file Teamsters that did this. This was a big shocker for… It wasn’t shocking to me. I said, “How the hell are Teamsters?” These are tough people. How the hell are they going to vote for this woman, this terrible person? She’s weak in so many ways. She’s weak. They’re not going to vote for that. I said a long time ago, I don’t believe… I actually believe they would’ve been better if they left crooked Joe Biden in because I actually think at least he had a base. She has no base.
(01:07:49)
She was the last person… She came in last because when he ran, he got 14 million votes, whatever you want. I’m not a big fan of his. I wouldn’t say he’s exactly the greatest. Do we agree? Not exactly the greatest. He doesn’t have any idea where the hell he is, but I think he’s better than she is. And he had a base. He had a little base because of years and years. He made up a lot of it. He said he lived here. He lived there. He said, “I used to fly jets too.” If pilots came in, “I used to fly jets.” If truckers came in, “I used to drive a truck.” The worst of all though was when he said, “I want to play him in golf.” He wants to play me in golf. You ever see him play? Yeah. His career. And Trump… Oh, but I’m a good golfer. No, I’m a good golfer. He said, “I want to play him in golf. I’ll give him three strokes aside.” I said, “Can you believe this? The guy can’t play. He never could.” By the way, 30, 40 years ago, he couldn’t play either. I was also honored to receive the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police representing almost 400,000 police office, biggest organization all across our country. And also, I got almost every single police. Maybe I got them all, but I want to say almost because the fake news is back there, so I have to be careful. If I say I got them all and there’s one little group in some place… No, but I got almost every single group of police officers and law enforcement, generally sheriffs, everybody. These are great people, and we got to let them do their job.
(01:09:40)
Also, central to Kamala’s agenda for economic destruction is her plan to impose the largest individual tax hikes in American history on you, the largest small business tax hike. She wants to get rid of the estate tax provision that I have in my tax where if you die and you love your children, you can leave your small farm or small business to your kids. If you don’t love your children, it doesn’t matter. Does anybody here not love their children? Okay, then I’ve covered 100% of the audience. Well, there are some, but they’re embarrassed. They don’t want to raise their head.
(01:10:25)
But also, it’s the wants to impose the largest capital gains tax in history and even a brand new wealth confiscation tax, or as they call it, unrealized capital gain where you have to pay a capital gain even if you keep your business or keep whatever it is that you want to keep. You have to go out, get it appraised. And then, after you get it appraised, you have to negotiate… This is the craziest thing. That’s called the communist sex. That’s basically a confiscation. I mean, some people in this room, you’re wealthy, but you don’t have a lot of cash and you’re no longer wealthy with this one. This one is whack job, but I don’t know if it’s ever been used. I mean, I’ve heard about it for years, but it’s called unrealized capital gains. That means exactly what says, it’s they’re unrealized. So you can’t tax them, which will annihilate the stock market and wipe out the savings of millions and millions of seniors and retirees and middle class families will be devastated.
(01:11:26)
Kamala Harris is a tax queen. She’s known as the tax queen. She loves taxing people. This is the only election I’ve ever seen where somebody brags about we’re going to raise your taxes. I’ve grown up watching politics. I’ve always liked politics. I’ve been on the other side writing contribution checks, but I’ve watched and I’ve never heard anything like a politician says, “We will cut your taxes.” This is constantly, even if they don’t do it, by the way. A lot of times they don’t. “We will cut your taxes. It is our goal to cut your taxes. We’re going to cut.” Right? Mike? Every politician.
(01:12:01)
Have you ever seen one that doesn’t do that? I have all these great people here. Great congressmen. Great congressmen, warriors. David. David, are you going to ever say we will raise your taxes? No, I don’t think so. No, I’ve never seen it. This is the only group. “We are going to raise your taxes. We’re going to give you capital gains, confiscation. We’re going to do things that nobody has ever had to do. Vote for Kamala.” Who the hell is going to vote? Open borders, tax increases, regulations at a level that no business will be able to hire you. Kamala is coming for your money. She’s coming for your pension. She’s coming for your savings. And unless you defeat her in November, this country’s going to go to hell. As president, I will keep Kamala’s greedy hands out of your pockets, and I will deliver gigantic tax cuts for working families of Pennsylvania. Thank you.
(01:13:06)
And very importantly, this is so important because this is something, and she tried to copy me. That one didn’t work out that she tried. A few months later, she said it. She got slaughtered. We will have no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on social security benefits for seniors. No tax. No tax. And it’s going to lead to great things. A lot of people don’t give. I know a lot about overtime. I’d hated they give overtime. I hated it. I’d get other people, I shouldn’t say this, but I’d get other people in. I wouldn’t pay. I hate it. This is going to lead to a lot more. I think it’s going to be economically positive, but I’m not even doing it for that reason. I’m doing it because the [inaudible 01:14:09] tax on overtime, it’s something so good, but no tax for the seniors. Do we have any seniors here?
(01:14:16)
I hate to admit it. I’m a senior. They’ll say he’s got a conflict of interest. He’s given this to himself. Watch. I’ll end up in front of a grand jury tomorrow, “Donald Trump has suggested no tax on social security benefits and he’s got a conflict of interest. We’re putting him before a grand jury,” because I’ve seen more grand juries than Alphonse Capone and he averaged about killing one person a week. Alphonse, the meanest of them all. I know more about grand juries than Alphonse ever even thought about. My father’s looking down on my mother. They’re great people. They say, “Can you believe my son did this? Can you believe that my son would run for politics and be treated this way?” But you know what? And we’re doing great. We won the big case in Florida where we’re winning them all. I’ll tell you, what did you see? We won the big case. That was the big one. “They’re going to get him in Florida. They’re going to get him in Florida.” It was always… That seemed to be the documents case.
(01:15:18)
I had every right to have them, called the Presidential Records Act. That’s what they passed it for. But he didn’t have that act because he wasn’t president and he got out. You know how he got out? And I don’t want to talk about him too much because she’s running. Maybe he’ll go back. If she does really badly, they’ll probably put him back. Let’s read change. But think of this, they got him out. They said he’s guilty of what he did, but he’s grossly incompetent, which she never told us by the way. That’s putting our country at risk. She should’ve told us, but he’s incompetent. So nobody like this should be able to go to court. So think of it. He can’t go to court, but he can run the United States of America. There’s something wrong with that, right? There’s something wrong with that.
(01:16:06)
But the big case was a document’s case in Florida and we had a brilliant judge who was somebody that understood this whole thing. And I won the case in its entirety. And they go like… That was the big one. The big one was that, “We are going to get him in Florida. We’re going to get that documents case.” Now, these are very crooked people. These people have weaponized the justices and we’re not going to let it happen. We’re not going to let it happen. It’s a shame, but that’s what it’s been. Just makes your job more difficult.
(01:16:42)
But it’s all what we fight and the resolve that we have. It’s the big reason why we’re leading in Pennsylvania. And the Emerson poll just came out. I just heard two seconds ago actually, we’re up in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia, and they’re the only ones they did. Even the New York Times, they’re not big fans of mine. I’m not big fans of them, the failing New York Times. The Sienna poll, we’re up in North Carolina by a lot, and we’re up in Georgia by four, and we’re up in Arizona by five. That’s in the New York Times. If they say that, David, that means we’re up by… He goes, “Uncle Sam said triple.” I think you’re right.
(01:17:19)
Uncle Sam, please stand up. Look at this guy. Thank you. And by the way, he doesn’t work for me. He goes to a lot of these. They say it’s the greatest show on earth. It is pretty great, isn’t it though, isn’t it? The people make it great. It’s the greatest show on Earth. But Uncle Sam, I don’t know who he is, but I shook his hand the other day at the Nassau Coliseum when we had our big one, but I shook his hand. He’s got the strongest hands. He almost broke… I couldn’t believe it. I said, “Uncle Sam has strong hands.” David, I was complaining the whole night. I said, “I’m never shaking that guy’s hand again.” Have you known that? You have strong hands. He said, “Thank you, sir, very much,” and I felt that cracking feeling, right? No, you’re a strong guy, right? Strong hands.
(01:18:19)
What did you do for a living?

Speaker 2 (01:18:20):

I want to go you [inaudible 01:18:22], but I’m a roofer.

Donald Trump (01:18:22):

Okay, that’s… A roofer, good. I can see it. Good. I’ll bet you’re a good one too. Thank you. Thank you, Uncle Sam. When she gets a little… She doesn’t get a crowd, but when she gets a little crowd, they have buses coming in. So we take pictures of the buses. We give them to the fake news. They never report it. The bus people… And then they only show the first three or four rows. But we don’t, like Uncle Sam, I mean, I don’t pay anybody to come. We don’t do any of that stuff. We have the most incredible group of people all over the country. I mean, if you were up in Wisconsin, if you were up in Wisconsin, you would’ve seen something that actually was incredible. But we’re winning in Pennsylvania and the main thing that we have to do is we have to get out the vote. We have to get out the vote because if we lose this election, we are going to have a problem with this country, the likes of which I think no country has ever faced before.
(01:19:24)
Here in Pennsylvania, you also need to vote for your next senator, and he’s a great guy. I’ve known him for a long time. He is a winner in the military. He’s a winner in life. He’s got a fantastic wife and family, and I’m telling you, he’s a warrior. He was a warrior in the military. He then goes into private practice and he made a lot of money. He ran one of the biggest firms and did really great, respected so much beyond this, and he just wanted to do something I would say for the country and for Pennsylvania because Pennsylvania to the country, but he loves his country, loves the Commonwealth. And Dave McCormick, just come up for a second would you, Dave? Come on up.
(01:20:06)
It’s so great to have you.

Dave McCormick (01:20:06):

Thank you.

Donald Trump (01:20:12):

You go and do it.

Dave McCormick (01:20:21):

All right. Thank you, Mr. President, and hello Erie. How are you? I just wanted to say, Mr. President, thank you for coming back to the Keystone State. This is the place where we’re going to retire Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and send you back to the White House, right here in Pennsylvania, right here, this day, right here in Erie. Erie, the bellwether right here. And this is also where we’re going to have the chance to fire a guy named Bob Casey. Bob Casey is weak. He’s weak. He’s a career politician. He’s liberal, and we got to send him back in and bring a Republican majority of the Senate to get the Trump agenda across the finish line.
(01:21:19)
I’m a new to politics, but ever since I can remember, I’ve had people tell me, “This is the most important election of your lifetime.” How many times have we heard it? I want to tell you, my friends, this, for our kids, for our grandkids, this is the most important election of our lifetimes right here. And it’s a race. It’s a race between strength, a guy who says, “fight, fight, fight,” and weakness, the weakness of Kamala Harris. It is a race between common sense policies and a radical liberal agenda. You don’t have to listen to me. This is a woman who said, in her own words, “We want to ban fracking. We want to transition energy workers. We want to give amnesty to 10 million illegal immigrants. We want to make sure they have federal benefits. We want to have mandatory buybacks of your guns. We want to defund the police.” How about this? “We want to reduce your red meat consumption,” right? We need common sense leadership. It’s common sense.
(01:22:38)
We need a leader who’s going to open up our energy sector, that pure, beautiful natural gas from Pennsylvania right here, President Trump. We need leadership to tame. We got to tame this inflation and help working families with President Trump. We need to bring law and order to our cities, and we need to secure that border and stop these illegal immigrants coming in and bringing crime and fentanyl into Pennsylvania. And most important, our adversaries around the world are testing us. They’re challenging us every day. We need peace through strength that we only will get if we get President Trump back in the White House and a majority in the Senate. So I want to tell y’all this is the most important election of your lifetime, but it depends on you. You got to get out there. You got to tell your friends. You got to get them to vote. This is the most important election of your lifetime. Let’s go do it. Thank you.

Donald Trump (01:23:49):

Thank you. Great, Dave.

Speaker 3 (01:23:53):

USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA.

Donald Trump (01:23:54):

That’s great, David. So get out. Dave McCormick, great guy. You got to get him in. He’ll be a tremendous asset, tremendous help to you and to everybody.
(01:24:14)
We’re also pleased to be joined by a couple of real warriors, Mike Kelly, who I mentioned before. Mike, please stand up, congressman. This guy, he’s a great guy. He’s been my friend for a long time. I won’t say how long because I don’t want to have them think we’re a little old because we’re not old. Where it counts, we’re not old. But I’ll tell you, Mike is a tremendous guy, and he is been that for a long time. And he loves your commonwealth and he loves it a lot, and he loves our country. So thank you, Mike, for being here. Appreciate it.
(01:24:52)
And another long time friend, Nick Langworthy, who is a congressman, doing really well. I’ve known him for… He was the leader of the party. He was a leader of everything he’s done, and you’re doing a great job. Thank you very much, Nick. Thank you. And a very popular mayor of Slippery Rock, JD Longo. Thank you, JD. Thank you very much. Good job. Good job. And all the other people. We have so many people here. We won’t do all, and I apologize, but we got to get back to it and then we’ll get the hell out of here. You go home, watch a football game or something, right?
(01:25:36)
Lyin’ Kamala Harris is the worst vice president acknowledged to be in history. Everyone thought she wouldn’t get it, but they wanted to be politically correct, so she gave it to her. And here are the facts. She wants open borders. She costs the typical family $29,000. Think of that. Because of her inflation policy, it’s going to cost a lot more than that very soon, is going up by a lot. She was an original creator of defund the police. Are there any police officers? She was for defund the police. Anybody that wants to defund the police for even one week is not worthy of being the President of the United States. And just to show you, go ahead, put up that video please.

Speaker 4 (01:26:27):

Kamala Harris’s radical ideas keep ending in tragedy. Harris raised money to fund the release of violent criminals like Shawn Michael Tillman.

Speaker 5 (01:26:37):

The Minnesota Bail Fund, promoted by Kamala Harris, but recently helped secure the release of a repeat felon who just got charged with murder. Shawn Michael Tillman shot and killed a passenger on a train platform after reportedly being released from jail three weeks prior.

Speaker 4 (01:26:53):

Harris’s liberal ideas get people killed.

Donald Trump (01:26:55):

I’m Donald J. Trump, and I approve this message.

Donald Trump (01:27:07):

So we’re trying to show you, and we’re working hard because a lot of people don’t know her. She’s a disaster. You can’t have her. Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE and she supports free healthcare for illegal aliens. She wants mass amnesty and citizenship for everyone. All of these people, even if they’re criminals, they’re looking for amnesty and they want to become citizens of our country. Those countries throw them all out. She says, “We must not utter the words illegal alien, radical Islamic terrorists.” Remember I used to use that word all the time because we had a problem. We didn’t have one terror attack during my four years because they knew they couldn’t do it.
(01:27:52)
But maybe worst of all, she lost more than … This is not even possible to believe, 325,000 migrant children are missing, many of whom have been trafficked and raped. As California Attorney General, she lost them all, and she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon and rape of an unconscious person as totally nonviolent crimes. No, this is a radical left lunatic we’re dealing with. By the way, if she wins, it’s not going to be so pleasant for me, but I don’t care. I really don’t care. We have a job to do. You can’t let her win. You can’t, because they’re unpleasant. They’re unpleasant anyway. They’re crooked people. They’re crooked people. She praised the idea of a 70 to 80% tax rate up.

Crowd (01:28:52):

We need Trump. We need Trump. We need Trump.

Donald Trump (01:29:08):

That’s great. Thank you. Thank you very much. They have the best seat in the house actually. They only see the back, but all those cameras are on them. And every once in a while, a star emerges. How about the stars that emerged in Butler? Those people behind me, so many stars emerged. They were behind me and they didn’t run. They weren’t running, right? Mike is doing a fantastic job, by the way on that. Thank you, Mike Kelly. What a fantastic job he’s doing. He gets it. But you know, amazing. Just for a second.
(01:29:49)
So they have these crowd control experts and they were explaining, when one bullet is fired, big stadiums will run out there. They call it a stampede. And many people oftentimes are killed. Many bullets were fired. They were going over my head. We lost Corey, the great firefighter, one great guy. And two other people were supposed to die, but the doctors up there were phenomenal and they saved their lives. We worked with them. But what happened was incredible. But the guy comes in, he says, “I’ve never seen anything like this. All those bullets were flying.” And you didn’t see the crowd out here. It was massive. It was, I think as big as crowd as you’ll ever see. And by the way, we’re going back to Butler. We’re going to be there. We’re going back.
(01:30:32)
That’s a big deal. We have a lot of people coming, and I really believe that will be the safest place on earth. And also, I think I’ll start the speech by saying, “As I was saying.” But the crowd control expert said, “I’ve never seen …” They couldn’t see the people here because the camera was here, and we had many cameras and it was amazing. The whole thing was horrible. But they had the people in the back. Nobody ran. Not one. You probably had like 150 people back there. The big crowd was here, but those people were locked on television because that’s the way the cameras are facing. The one guy behind me, right? Did you see him? He’s up. He was looking to fight. His name is Tom. His name is Tom, and I got to meet him. But he was a brave guy. And is he here? He was brave. That’s not the one I was talking about, by the way. It’s not the one I was … But he was a brave guy too. But everybody up there, they were amazing. They were amazing.

Crowd (01:32:01):

We had your back.

Donald Trump (01:32:02):

They did. They had my back. They saw that we were in trouble. Something bad happened. And normally everybody would flee. Nobody, not one male, female, nobody. You could see the anger on their face. They didn’t know exactly … They just knew that your president was in big trouble because they saw that happening and they didn’t flee. And can I tell you, these people didn’t flee. There were so many people. Tens of thousands of people, they didn’t flee. They stood, they watched and they wanted to know what could they do to help. The people in the front row. Some of the front row Joes were there. You were there.
(01:32:43)
And it was amazing. You stood, I watched you. You didn’t move. I call him Mr. Wall because you can’t go wrong. But Mr. Wall stood there. He didn’t move, and then she was like a piece of … And bullets are flying all over the place. And it was an amazing thing to see, frankly. It was real bravery. The crowd control person, a real pro. He said, he’s never said anything like it. And what they did, a lot of them … The one guy, he just wants to find out. The bullets are going back and forth, a lot of shots. And it was amazing. So we’re going to go back to Butler next week, next week. Good.

Crowd (01:33:35):

We love Trump. We love Trump. We love Trump.

Donald Trump (01:33:35):

Going to be a lot of people. And I want to thank the town, they were great. They want to do it. It’s become a big tourist site. Can you believe this? It’s become a tremendous … Cars are riding by, they’re taking pictures. It’s become an amazing tourist site. But we’re going to be back there and we’re going to celebrate Cory, the firefighter who died, and really the two men that were so badly hurt and they’re better. Those doctors were amazing. The doctors actually saved the two guys. They’re great guys. Big Trumpers, and Cory was a big Trumper.
(01:34:08)
He just wanted to make America great again. But the two gentlemen, I said, “How many people are going to …” Because it was wall-to-wall people. So when you hear the bullets, you know they’re not landing on the ground. There was no ground to land on. There was only people, and they said, “Three are probably dead, sir.” And two of them were very badly hurt. They were brought to the hospital, and these doctors were unbelievable, the job they did. And so we appreciate the doctors and we’ll celebrate all three. And Cory in particular, we’re going to celebrate. The other two are making a lot of progress. They’re going to be in good shape very shortly.
(01:34:44)
And by the way, I want to thank while he’s here, Mike Kelly. You’re the head of the commission and nobody’s going to fool him. There’s not going to be any fooling around, right Mike? But Mike Kelly is the head of the commission and he’s the perfect guy to have. And I’ve been watching, it’s been amazing what’s happening. And very bipartisan, even the Democrats who are agreeing, “You can’t let things like this happen.” And Joe Biden ought to get up and say, “You are threatening a former president and a candidate. And if you do anything to him …” It’s okay. Look me, it’s a very dangerous business. But Biden ought to say, “You do anything to him, we’re going to blow you off the face of the earth.” And then we’re not going to have any problems.
(01:35:40)
Right? But he can’t say that. Other presidents would say that. He just can’t probably get the words out. But I’ll tell you what, if it were reversed, if I were president and somebody was threatening a president, even I didn’t like that person and he was from the opposite party, I would tell the threatening country, “You do anything to him, we’re going to blow you off the face of the earth.” And nothing’s going to happen. But we haven’t had that happen, have we, Mike? We haven’t had that happen.
(01:36:15)
So it makes life a little bit more dangerous, but that’s okay. We know what we got into. Kamala pledged to abolish private healthcare and force everyone onto socialist government-run healthcare with high taxes and deadly wait times. We’ve got to wait six, seven months sometimes. And she even endorsed free sex changes for illegal aliens and detention at taxpayer expense. That’s why five weeks from now, we are going to tell her, “Kamala, you’ve done a horrible job as vice president. You are the worst borders czar in the history of the world, not just our country. We have to make a change. Kamala, you are horrible. Kamala, you’re fired. You’re fired. Get out of here. Get out of here, Kamala. Go back to San Francisco Kamala, which by the way you destroyed.”
(01:37:14)
From the moment we take back the White House from Kamala Harris and sleepy Joe, I believe we’re going to have the four greatest years in the history of our country. We’re going to put our country back together. It’s going to go fast. Starting on day one, I will seal the border and stop the invasion of migrants into our country, very dangerous migrants. We will carry out the largest deportation operation of criminals in American history. We have no choice. We will end inflation and make America affordable again. We’re going to get the prices down. We have to get them down. It’s too much, groceries, cars, everything. We’re going to get the prices down. While working Americans catch up, we are going to put a temporary cap on credit card interest rates at 10%. People are being made to pay 25%. Temporary ban. We will become energy independent. We were energy independent four years ago.
(01:38:12)
We will become again … First time ever we were energy independent. We’re going to become energy dominant, but now we will be. We will energy dominant like no other country has ever been before. Much bigger than Saudi Arabia, much bigger than Russia. We were in third and even fourth place when I took over. When I left, we were in first place ahead of them by a lot, and then bad things started to happen. We will open ANWR again. I got it done. Ronald Reagan couldn’t get it done. Nobody could get it done. It’s probably the largest site in the world. Could be bigger than Saudi Arabia. And we will tap the liquid goal that’s under our feet and we will drill, baby, drill.
(01:38:57)
We will stop outsourcing and turn the United States into a manufacturing superpower, which we were in the process of doing, and it won’t even be hard. Here is the deal that I will be offering to every major company and manufacturer on earth: we will cut your taxes from 21% down to 15% and give you every possible advantage, but only if you make your product here in America and hire American workers for the job.

Crowd (01:39:31):

USA, USA, USA.

Donald Trump (01:39:48):

And if you’re a foreign country and you don’t make your product here, then you will have to pay a tariff, a fairly substantial one, which will go into our treasury, will reduce taxes. But if you send your product into the United States, that will happen. On the other hand, if you want to build your factory in the United States, there will be no taxes, there will be no tariffs, there will be nothing to pay. So if you build your factory or your plant in the United States, there will be no tariff, and therefore they will all be coming and they’ll be building and you will be getting so many job offers and a lot of it’s going to take place right here in Pennsylvania. We will pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if China or any other country charges us a 100 or a 200% tariff, then we will charge them a reciprocal tariff or tax of 100 or 200% and we will do it immediately.
(01:40:49)
We were in the process of getting that done and then bad things happened with a thing called an election. I will not let Mexico, which has taken a lot of your business now, or China or any other country, sell cars into the United States to the detriment of our autoworkers, because with what they’re doing with electric car mandates and everything else, we won’t have any autoworkers. The autoworkers are going to vote overwhelmingly for me. They have a stupid person in charge of the union named Shawn Fain. The teamsters have a brilliant person, but the autoworkers have a stupid … He’s agreed and wants them to build all electric cars. If you do that, there will be no more auto jobs. They’ll all be made in China and other places. And I will not allow US Steel to be sold to Japan. We’re going to fight that. Right, Mike?
(01:41:48)
And I will always protect social security and Medicare with no cuts. We’re not going to be raising ages, and for four years I didn’t. I will stop the drugs and fentanyl pouring in and killing our kids and killing our families. We will crush violent crime and protect all law enforcement, including Border Patrol, ICE sheriffs, and Secret Service. We will terminate the green new scam and spend the trillions of unspent dollars on roads, bridges, real infrastructure and paying down debt, not fake infrastructure that’s caused massive inflation with no benefit at all. I will settle the war on Ukraine and I will end the chaos in the Middle East and I will prevent World War III.

Crowd (01:42:31):

Trump, Trump, Trump.

Donald Trump (01:42:53):

Thank you.

Crowd (01:42:54):

Trump, Trump. Trump.

Donald Trump (01:42:55):

Thank you, folks. I appreciate it. I got a good lively group back there, right? They’re great. They love our country. They love our country. But we will have, again, peace through strength. We had no wars for four years. We had no wars, other than ISIS, which I inherited, and we ended ISIS in four weeks. That was the end of ISIS. We ended 100% of the ISIS caliphate. We have a great military, but not the guys that you see on television that have no clue what’s going on. But the real military is great, and they showed me that. They really showed me that. It was supposed to take five years, we did it in four weeks. There’s a man. Thank you very much. Look at that guy. Thank you very much.
(01:43:43)
Thank you very much. And I will support universal school choice, and I believe the Lifeline Scholarship Bill would be a great start for those students trapped in the worst-performing schools in Pennsylvania. A lot of people want to see that happen. I understand it, right? You know that? Oh, you do know that. Good. It would provide financial assistance to empower parents to take their children out of a failing school and send them to a public, private, religious or charter school that’s really right for them. School choice is a very big deal. A lot of people don’t know that, but it’s a big deal. It’ll be great. I’m going to take the Department of Education, close it in Washington, let the states run their own education. Very important, because we spend more money per pupil than any other nation in the world by far, and yet we’re ranked at the bottom of every list. So you know the expression, “what the hell do you have to lose?” I did that with our great … Because they’ve been so supportive. I’ve gone up like a rocket ship. But they’re being hurt very badly by the people pouring into our country, our African-American population. I said, “Well, you’re last on crime. You’re being devastated with inflation more than anybody else. You have the smallest percentage of homeownership.” And I went through a list of 12 things. This was a long time ago, 2015 when I was running, even before. And I was with a group and I wasn’t doing particularly well with them, and I am going through this whole list of things. “You’re last in ownership, you’re last in cash and having money in the bank.” Last in all these different categories.
(01:45:37)
And I said, “Vote for me. What the hell do you have to lose?” Remember that? “What the hell do you have to lose?” And my people didn’t like it. They said backstage, “Oh sir, that was not nice.” I said, “It is nice.” Anyway, I didn’t know. I figured maybe I shouldn’t have said it. The following day, I went up 12 points. And today we’re the highest we’ve ever been with the African-American population. We did things that were really incredible for them and with them. Criminal justice reform, right? Took care of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities. I got them long-term financing. They were great. We did a lot. And we’re doing great with the Black population. Hispanic population is like a rocket ship for us, but we have to protect it because the people coming through Kamala, they’re coming through the border and they’re taking your jobs.
(01:46:39)
Your job numbers are going way up in terms of your unemployment, way up. I don’t know if anybody’s seen, Black unemployment that last few months, these people are coming in illegally and they’re taking your jobs, Hispanic also. And next will be unions. They’re going to have a big effect on the unions. So you guys better get together and vote for Trump. I’ll tell you, it’s going to be a mess. We will rebuild our cities, including Washington DC, making them safe and clean and beautiful again, because our cities are in trouble and our capital is like a murdering pit. We’re going to get that cleaned up and we’re going to make it safe and beautiful and people are going to be proud to go back to our capital without being killed. And we will keep the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency because right now, David, it’s under siege, and you know we can’t lose that.
(01:47:33)
Losing that would be like losing a war, and then we would in fact be a Third World country. We’ll lose the reserve. But this is how we will end the era of inflation, mayhem, misery. Under Kamala and Crooked Joe, it was just misery. What a miserable few years. It’s just been horrible. And people all over the world, especially the leaders, are laughing at how stupidly our country is run. Remember, we’re the party of common sense. And 95% of it is, “We’re conservative,” and all that, but whether you’re conservative, liberal, we’re the party of common sense. So important. But we’re going to unleash safety, prosperity, and peace for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. Together we will deliver low taxes, low regulation, low energy costs, low interest rates, low inflation so that everyone can afford things like groceries, a car and a home, and have money left over. We will stop the invasion, end migrant crime, strengthen our military, build a missile defense shield over our country, keep Critical Race Theory and transgender insanity out of our schools, And we will keep men out of women’s sports. We will defend the Second Amendment, protect religious liberty, restore free speech, and we will secure our elections once and for all. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. But for that to happen, we must defeat lying Kamala Harris, and we must stop her country destroying liberal agenda. She is a radical left communist and we cannot have her be the president of our country. We never want that ideology anywhere around because it doesn’t work and it’s been proven 100 times. Remember, early voting is beginning right now. Get going, right now.

Crowd (01:50:07):

Vote, vote, vote.

Donald Trump (01:50:07):

So you must get out and vote. We want a landslide that’s too big to rig. We’re going to have too big to rig. And on November 5th, we will save our economy, we will rescue our middle class, we will reclaim our sovereignty and restore our borders. We will always put America first and we will take back our country that we love so much. Together we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again, healthy again, strong again, proud again, safe again, free again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. God bless you, everybody God bless you. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Have a good time."," Erie, Pennsylvania","2024-10-01",0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0

Donald Trump (05:25):

… [inaudible 00:05:24] in the history of our country. I believe that we’re going to have four of the greatest years in the history of our country. I will, once and for all, secure our elections. We’re going to go to paper ballots. We’re going to have same-day voting, voting ID. We’re going to do it properly. We’re going to have good, secure, beautiful elections. We never want what happened in 2020 to happen again. But, until then, Republicans must win, and we must use every appropriate tool available to beat the Democrats. They are destroying our country.
(05:56)
Whether you vote earlier, absentee, by mail, or in person, we are going to protect the vote. That’s the most important thing we have to do is protect the vote. Keep your eyes open, because these people want to cheat and they do cheat, and, frankly, it’s the only thing they do well. We will make sure your ballot is secure and your voices heard. Many Republicans like to vote on election day and we must swamp the radical Democrats with massive turnout on Tuesday, November 5th. The way you win is to swamp them. If we swamp them, they can’t cheat. It just doesn’t work out. But if you can’t make it, you need to make a plan. Register and vote any way possible. We got to get your vote.
(06:37)
So, with your vote, we will win a victory the likes of which no one has ever seen before. We will evict crooked Joe Biden from the White House and we will take back our country on November 5th, 2024. The most important day in the history of our country. That’s what it’s going to go down as. Thank you.

MUSIC (06:56):

Yeah, and I’ve set up and torn down this stage with my own two hands.
(06:56)
We’ve traveled this land, packed tight in minivans.

And all this for the fans, girls, money and fame.
(07:09)
I play their game, and as they scream my name.
(07:09)
I will show no shame, I live and die for this.

If I come off soft, then chew on this.

Speaker 1 (37:07):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage the moderator of tonight’s town hall, Senator Marsha Blackburn from the great State of Tennessee.

MUSIC (37:38):

Let me back it up to the start of the climb.
(37:40)
Faced with an army-

Marsha Blackburn (37:50):

Hello, Michigan. How are you doing? All right. I am absolutely delighted to be here in Warren, Michigan. I have learned today that this is the hub of engineering and manufacturing for the US auto industry. And it is all because of you, the auto workers. Now, if you are an auto worker, I want you to raise your hand high. Let us say thank you. I am absolutely thrilled that we have the heart and soul of the auto industry right here. You are with us tonight.
(38:42)
And one of the things that I think we have to pay attention to is what we all believe in. And looking at your faces and listening to you while I was backstage, I know that you believe in these values that have made this country great. Hard work, community, faith, family, and you’ve put that to work to build a great community. And in World War II, it was Warren, Michigan that put their manufacturing might to work and helped us win that war. So we celebrate that with you. And we’re so pleased that you put that to work and now you make the finest cars on the face of the planet right here.
(39:41)
But, you know, these great manufacturing jobs, the Democrats just don’t seem to understand, or maybe they don’t care, that we are losing a lot of these jobs. And they like to say, “Well, it’s automation,” or, “Well, we’ve changed how we do business,” or, “It’s global competition with China.”

Audience (40:11):

Boo!

Marsha Blackburn (40:13):

And a lot of times it is bad policies and environmental regulation that the Democrats push forward. And what they don’t get is you are paying the price with your jobs and with your wages. So let me ask you a question. Got one question for you. Are you better off today than you were four years ago?

Audience (40:48):

No!

Marsha Blackburn (40:54):

All right. One more question. Can you stand four more years with Kamala Harris?

Audience (41:06):

No!
(41:06)
[inaudible 00:41:12].

Marsha Blackburn (41:13):

Well, I want to tell you something. Under President Donald Trump, he created 400,000 new manufacturing jobs in this country. And you know why he did it? He believes in you and the American worker. He revitalized manufacturing in the USA. He returned jobs from places like China. And you know what? He did it once, he will make American manufacturing great again. So here we go. I want you to give it up big time. Let’s make it huge for the 45th President of the United States, soon to be the 47th, Donald J. Trump.

MUSIC (42:22):

And I’m proud to be an American.
(42:22)
Where at least I know I’m free.
(42:22)
And I won’t forget the men who died.
(42:22)
Who gave that right to me.
(42:22)
And I’d gladly stand up next to you.
(42:22)
And defend Her still today.
(42:22)
‘Cause there ain’t no doubt.
(42:25)
I love this land.
(42:25)
God Bless the U.S.A. From the lakes of Minnesota.
(43:08)
To the hills of Tennessee Across the plains of Texas.
(43:14)
From sea to shining sea.
(43:19)
From Detroit down to Houston And New York to L.A.
(43:25)
Where’s pride in every American heart.
(43:28)
And it’s time we stand and say.
(43:30)
That I’m proud to be an American.
(43:30)
Where at least I know I’m free.
(43:30)
And I won’t forget the men who died.
(43:30)
Who gave that right to me.
(43:30)
And I’d gladly stand up next to

MUSIC (43:30):

God Bless the USA. And I’m proud to be an American, where at least I know I’m free. And I won’t forget the men who died who gave that right to me. And I’d gladly stand up next to you and defend Her still today, because there ain’t no doubt I love this land. God Bless the USA.

Marsha Blackburn (45:07):

Thank you. Well…

Donald Trump (45:08):

Thank you.

Marsha Blackburn (45:09):

Mr. President, it’s all yours.

Donald Trump (45:12):

Well, it’s great to be with you. And this has been a very interesting day. Some numbers came out. Let’s give you the bad news first. The worst numbers I think I’ve ever heard. You know exactly what I’m talking about with a lot of people being released into our country that should never, ever be here, right? Like nobody can believe. But I’ve been saying it for three and a half years because we are the party of common sense. We really know what’s going on. And coming out of jails, murderers at levels that nobody thought possible. And it was all done by comrade Kamala Harris, our great border czar who’s incompetent, who’s totally incompetent, and 245,000 criminals. But 13, more than 13, much more than 13,000 convicted murderers who were in jail. They were all released into our country, and we can’t put up with this. This is gross incompetence. And let’s get back to the show, okay? Get back to the show, right?

Marsha Blackburn (46:24):

Absolutely. And Mr. President, I’ve got to tell you, they have been having a great time. While they’ve been waiting for you, they’ve been singing, they’ve been talking, and I know we’ve got some questions tonight. And Nico, you’re first up. Let’s have at it.

Nico (46:46):

Good evening, Mr. President.

Marsha Blackburn (46:47):

Hello, Nico.

Nico (46:49):

My name is Nico. I’m from Plymouth, Michigan. Last week I was laid off at Detroit Diesel. I was an assembler on the line building diesel engines made in the USA. And my question is about immigration. Illegal immigrants are hurting American workers like me who are just starting off. How will you stop this invasion?

Donald Trump (47:09):

Well, very easy. We’re going to close the wall and we’re going to close the border. I built hundreds of miles. Nico, I built hundreds of miles of wall and did it well. And we had the best numbers we ever had four years ago. And now we have the worst numbers in the history of the world, not just this country. At least 21 million people came in during their term and as we just said, a lot of them are real bad people, real rough people. But they’re also taking a lot of jobs from Americans, probably happened with you, and as the small number of jobs they created were all taken by illegal immigrants in the last short period of time. And we’re going to make that change. You look like you’d be great. I’d like to have you make the motor of the engine, the motor of my car.
(48:02)
Any day of the week. I bet you did a great job. I’ll bet he did a great job. But we’re going to bring the automobile business back to this area where it started and we’re going to bring it back at levels that have never been seen before. We’re going to be lowering taxes, we’re going to be doing a lot of things, but we’re lowering taxes. We’re going to use tariffs very, very wisely. Our country in the 1890s was probably, Marsha, probably the wealthiest it ever was because it was a system of tariffs. And we had a president McKinley, right? You remember Mount McKinley? And then they changed the name. But one of those things, he was really a very good businessman and he took in billions of dollars at the time, which today it’s always trillions, but then it was billions and probably hundreds of millions.
(48:54)
But we were a very wealthy country and we’re going to be doing that now. We’re going to do it, where we keep… Our enemies and our friends too, they’ve taken advantage of us for years on trade and year by year, all the time, we’re losing our companies that make our cars, make the autos. A lot of them are going to Mexico now. And it’s Mexico through China because China owns the factories. They’re building big factories. They wouldn’t have done it with me. They’re building big factories, the biggest in Mexico, and they think they’re going to make the cars and sell them in and close up Detroit, close up everything in this area, close up South Carolina. And it’s not going to happen because we’re going to put very heavy tariffs on those cars coming across the border. And we’re not going to let that happen. We’re not going to let it happen.
(49:48)
So what we’re saying is, Nico, we’re going to have these companies that want to build in Mexico, they want to build in China. If they want to do business in the United States, they have to make their product, whether it’s a car or anything else, we want them to make their product, have their plant in the United States. This way, we employ our people, like Nico, we’re going to employ you, I guarantee. And we’re going to do it very fast. And then we have to keep out the competition and we’re going to make fair trade by charging them tariffs. If they want to come in and steal our wealth and steal our jobs and steal our companies, then they have to pay a price for that. And we’ve done it. And I charged, as Marsha can tell you, China paid hundreds of billions of dollars during my term, and I had no inflation.
(50:42)
We had the greatest economy in the history of our country and we were just getting started actually. But we had the greatest economy, the greatest employment for everybody, men, women, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, everybody, young people with a diploma, without a diploma. People that went to the best schools in the world, got PhDs. Every single class without exception was the best they’ve ever been. And we’re going to get that back and then some. So we’re going to bring a lot of companies in and we’re going to have a lot of jobs and you’re going to have a lot of jobs to choose from. Okay?

Nico (51:27):

Thank you.

Marsha Blackburn (51:28):

That’s great. Everybody appreciates that and appreciate when you talk about immigration, you talk about building the wall and making certain that we secure this country. Okay, Misty?

Donald Trump (51:44):

And by the way, we built built more wall than I said I was going to build. And then we had 200 miles of wall ready to go. It was all fabricated, all made to the highest specifications of Border Patrol and ICE, and it was all set. And then we got more votes than any sitting president has ever gotten by far. And they say we lost the election, so let’s leave it at this. You know what? We have one coming up in 39 days, so that’ll be a wonderful replacement. Wonderful replacement.

Marsha Blackburn (52:21):

Absolutely. All right, Misty.

Misty (52:28):

Good evening, President Trump.

Donald Trump (52:32):

I wasn’t sure. She reminded me when I was in the debate with crooked Hillary Clinton, she got up and she started walking around and I said, “What’s going on up here?” Go ahead. I didn’t know you were going for such a beautiful young lady. Go ahead, please.

Misty (52:48):

Thank you. Good evening, President Trump.

Donald Trump (52:52):

Good evening.

Misty (52:52):

My name’s Misty. I’m proudly… I’m sorry. I proudly build the Ford Broncos and Rangers. Yeah, I’ve been with Ford for 25 years. If I’m going to be honest with you, I’m sorry, I was not for you in the beginning. But my son told me, he said I’m an ignorant and I needed to educate myself on you.

Donald Trump (53:20):

That’s it.

Misty (53:20):

True.

Donald Trump (53:23):

That’s what we like. Where is he? Where is he? Is he here?

Misty (53:27):

No.

Donald Trump (53:27):

Well, you say I love your son. I think it’s great.

Misty (53:30):

He said, “Just get his autograph.” Anyways, so I took the challenge on and I’m proud to say that I am voting for you for again.

Donald Trump (53:45):

Thank you. Thank you very much.

Misty (53:46):

No, thank you.

Donald Trump (53:46):

Thank you.

Misty (53:46):

My question for you is I’m a single five and becoming difficult to afford the basics. So can you please tell me what you’re going to do to lower the prices for us?

Donald Trump (54:00):

Yeah, so what we have to do, because the prices are so high, thank you darling very much, it’s a great question. People are hurt by the cost of groceries, the cost of everything. There’s nothing less expensive. If you go back four or five years, everything was just a fraction of what it is now. And they’re making, essentially, if they make the same wages, they’re getting wiped out because prices are up 50, 60, 70% for a lot of things. For some items, it’s much more than that. Well, look at interest rates. They were 2%, now they’re 10%, but at 10% you can’t get the money at 2%. There was plenty of money for everybody for buying a house, et cetera, et cetera. But when you look at groceries, I think it’s a thing that really, I always say this is an election that I used to say determined by the stomach.
(54:47)
Actually, I don’t believe that anymore. I think it’s now determined by the brain because nobody wants to have criminals pouring into our country. Nobody wants to have any of these horrible things that are happening to our country, but we’re going to be bringing them down. It’s going to start with energy. We’re going to drill, baby, drill. Energy’s coming way down. Energy’s coming way down. And when energy comes down, everything else follows. That’s what started this onslaught of inflation, the greatest we’ve ever had in our country. We had the greatest inflation over the list, and it actually, we had almost no inflation. And that carried on for two years into their, I used to say his, now I say their, but nobody even really knows who our president is. If you want to know who’s our president, who is he? Nobody. We’re not sure who the president is.
(55:42)
Yeah, it sounds good. Thank you, thank you, thank you. But the inflation, it carried on for almost two years into that. We had a solid no inflation. It was solid and then it exploded because what they did was the energy. And also what they did just almost as importantly was they spent like nobody’s ever spent, they went crazy. And the green new scam, and they were spending on things that didn’t help the country. And it also drove, so between the energy and the spending, the inflation went up and food prices came with it, and rent came with it. Everything came with it. And we had, I think, the worst inflation we’ve ever had. And we’re going to bring it down. So we’re going to bring it down with energy and interest rates. The interest rates are going to come down, but first we’re going to get, and here’s a statement that I make to you tonight, that we are going to have energy.
(56:42)
We have more liquid gold, I call it. You’ve heard that said, liquid gold. That’s oil and gas. We have more oil and gas, liquid gold than any country in the world, including Saudi Arabia and Russia. And we’re going to bring it down. We’re going to bring your energy bills down and also business for business where they can employ people. But we’re going to bring the energy down by 50% in the first 5-0, 50% in the first 12 months. And when we do that, everything else is going to follow. Everything follows the energy. And because we have so much, they don’t drill. They go to Venezuela. We buy buy oil from Venezuela. What’s that all about? And we have more than anybody else in the world.
(57:29)
Think of it. Saudi Arabia doesn’t have as much. Russia doesn’t have as much. And we’re going to other countries. We’re going to drill and we’re going to take it out. Your energy bills will be 5-0, 50% lower one year from January 20th, one year from January 20th. And that’s going to have a huge impact. Okay? Thank you. Say hello to your son. Thank you. Very good. Good job. Thank you.

Marsha Blackburn (57:57):

Well, I think that everybody is ready to get those prices at the pump down. And one thing I found out is 84% of all the cars that these good people made and 84% of the cars sold in 2023 were gas powered cars. And we need to get that price down.

Donald Trump (58:27):

So it’s a good point. Look, they have an electric mandate. Every car is going to be electric, they say. I will terminate that now. And you have to understand, Elon endorsed me with the strongest endorsement and we love him and he’s great. And by the way, the Tesla is amazing, but not everybody should have an electric car. It might be seven or 8% of the market. And then you also want hybrids and you want to have pure gasoline-driven powered cars. We’re going to have everything. The new one is hydrogen. There’s one problem. Do you know what the problem is? They blow up. You’ll be to the other side of the arena and you won’t feel too good. So until they fix that problem, I’ve got to pass personally. If you’d like one, you could buy one, but I’m going to pass. But you’ve got to have alternatives and choices. That’s what the country’s all about. And we’re not going to have, I will end the electric mandate on day one of the administration. Okay?

Marsha Blackburn (59:33):

That is great. I tell you what, if we can get you back to drilling on day one and then get that inflation down, and our audience might not know this, when you left office, inflation was 1.4%. Today, the cumulative inflation rate is 20.3%. And as Mike Rogers, who’s running for Senate here, you’re going to have a great senator.

Donald Trump (01:00:10):

Where is he? He’s here someplace.

Marsha Blackburn (01:00:14):

Somewhere.

Donald Trump (01:00:15):

Where is Mike? There he is. Hey, Mike.

Marsha Blackburn (01:00:16):

There he is. All right.

Donald Trump (01:00:16):

Wow.

Marsha Blackburn (01:00:20):

There is Mike. But Mike gave me a great phrase when I was campaigning with him a few days ago. He said, “The most expensive vehicle you drive in 2024 is the grocery cart.” And Donald Trump is going to get those grocery prices down. All right.

Donald Trump (01:00:47):

We’re going to get them down. It’s a big deal. The groceries, more than anything else, I talk about what’s at the checkout counter, the groceries, and we’re going to get it all down. It’s going to be done. Not just stopping and holding inflation. That’s the easy part. We have this big damage done to our country. We have to get the prices down where bacon is up. Oh, bacon, we don’t order bacon anymore. It’s too expensive, right? But it’s all up too much. And we’re going to get it down, but it’s going to start with energy and it’s going to start also with interest rates because once that happens, interest rates are going to come down too.
(01:01:20)
We had, as Marsha said, we had 1.4%. You don’t want inflation at zero because that’s not actually good. And the worst thing you would have is deflation. Deflation’s probably in a certain way as bad or worse than inflation. The ideal number is between 1% every year. If you could do this for the next 100 years between 1% and 2%, and we were at 1.4% average, it was amazing, right? It was great. So we’re going to take care of inflation and quickly and we’re going to get those prices coming down very, very substantially and very quickly. Thank you.

Marsha Blackburn (01:02:04):

And make America affordable again.

Donald Trump (01:02:07):

And make America great again.

Marsha Blackburn (01:02:18):

All right. Okay. Tony? Where is Tony? He’s over here with the question. Right here. And they’re bringing you a microphone.

Donald Trump (01:02:26):

Hello.

Marsha Blackburn (01:02:26):

Have at it.

Tony (01:02:30):

Hello, good evening, Senator and Mr. President. Welcome to Michigan. As you heard, my name is Tony. Mr. Trump, we met last year at a great round of Bedminster with the Heritage Foundation. Good event, it was an honor. Our company’s based here in the US. We melt steel and we make automotive parts out of ductile iron for brake components, axle components, and those are made for the big three here. Sadly though, we’re losing jobs to China, India, Mexico, and it’s become more difficult to compete manufacturers like us. We are some of the largest users of energy. And under Harris and Biden, the energy costs triple. So my question is, what will you do to get energy back down so us US manufacturers can compete and bring it back to the jobs here?

Donald Trump (01:03:26):

Yeah, so it’s a great question. A lot of people have the same question because it’s affecting their companies. I just left one, a man from the Netherlands. He made a speech, a wonderful guy, and he said the problem was he opened up because of me. He opened in 2017 and he had three great years, and now with them he’s not doing well. What we’re doing is I said about the energy, as to what we do and how we do it. But China’s coming in and you said Mexico. Mexico’s a big threat now. Mexico’s taking a lot of your business and we’re not going to let that happen. We need a smart series of tariffs and taxes, Marsha, and it’s very simple business. China won’t take cars from outside of China. They only take them if you build in China. You have to build your factory. So if I’m making a car and I think I’m going to sell it into China, they have a massive over 100% tariff.
(01:04:20)
So what you do is you say, to not pay that tariff, “I’m going to have to build my factory in China.” And they encourage it, they help, and we’re going to be doing the same thing, but we’re going to do it even better. We’re going to bring cars back. We’re going to bring, like you say, what are you, auto parts and things like that? We’re going to bring that all back to this country. It’s all coming back. If they had to pay tariffs on what they’re doing and what they’re selling into our country, they wouldn’t be putting your business out of business if that’s where you’re going. It will never happen. And we’re going to do it just the opposite. Plus we’re lowering the tax rate. So I took it from 39% to 21%. These are for companies and that’s why we had the great numbers for jobs.
(01:05:04)
But now what I’m doing is I’m going and nobody thought that was possible, and I got it approved by Congress, believe it or not. Now we’re going to 21, from 21 to 15%, but you have to make your product in the USA. So if you want to take advantage of the low tax rate, you have to make your product. So we’ll be down to 15%. That gives us one of the lowest tax rates in the whole world. So it’s more than competitive. Companies will come here. But in addition to that, we’re going to keep this really terrible competition. I don’t mind the word competition, but it’s predatory. And we’re going to keep this competition out so that you’re able to grow your business and grow it well. And you’ll make the product and you’ll sell it inside our country. And I know exactly what your situation is and it’s so easy to solve. We’re going to need the help of the Senate.

Donald Trump (01:06:00):

… Senate, we’re going to need the help of the house. And if they won’t do it, I have the authorization and the power to do it myself, and we’ll have to do it.

Marsha Blackburn (01:06:11):

And that’s why we need Mike Rogers-

Donald Trump (01:06:13):

You need Mike Rogers.

Marsha Blackburn (01:06:14):

… as Senator Mike Rogers. And we’ve got Lisa McLain. Congresswoman McLain, yes?

Donald Trump (01:06:26):

A warrior.

Marsha Blackburn (01:06:27):

Yes. She is a warrior and the amazing, incredible Congressman, John James.

Donald Trump (01:06:36):

Hey, John. Good.

Marsha Blackburn (01:06:39):

And they will help us get this done. I appreciate that you talked about tariffs, and I think it’s so important that you continue to call out China, and we support you on that because we don’t want China building those plants in Mexico and then running those cars across the border.

Donald Trump (01:07:02):

Without any tax whatsoever, and putting everybody here in not only danger, it’s over. Your union head, I don’t know who he is, Sean Fain or something, whoever this guy is, he sold you out because he let Biden, who doesn’t know what he’s doing, I mean, you probably noticed.
(01:07:26)
He let this guy come up with an all-electric mandate. Those cars are all going to be built in China. We want cars built in the USA. It’s very simple. And they’re going to come in at levels… We’ll be having auto manufacturing at levels that we haven’t seen in 50 years. We’re going to have a lot of companies coming in.
(01:07:47)
And we’re going to make it competitive so they can come in and they can thrive. Not like this gentleman where they come in and they dump product. And you know what they do. They dump the product cheaply, and then everyone goes out of business. Then they take over the businesses and they sell it for two and three times what it was selling for before.
(01:08:05)
The whole thing, it’s really not too, Rockefeller, in the old days, he used to open a gas station. He used to under-price it by 50 or 100. He’d give the gas away. He’d drive the people out of business around him. Then he’d buy up the gas stations or close them, and he’d make a fortune.
(01:08:25)
That’s exactly what they’d do on an even bigger scale. We’re not going to let it happen. It’s going to be over. We’re going to have a smart system of tariffs. And by the way, if they don’t want to play that game, then we’re going to get a lot of money from tariffs.
(01:08:39)
So, Marsha can tell you, I charged hundreds of billions of dollars to China in tariffs and taxes. No other president has ever charged China 10 cents, and we’ve taken hundreds of billions of dollars. So much so that Biden can’t get rid of it. He’s still got it on. He wants to, but it’s so much money, and frankly, it’s a lot of money. But also, if you did get rid of it, they’d come in and they’d put all your businesses out of business.
(01:09:11)
So, the Senate and the House have to get really smart on this because purposely over a period of years, they’ve given it a bad name. Actually, I consider it one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen. The word tariff, I love it. I think it’s beautiful. Almost as beautiful as that chart that I look to the right. Almost as beautiful. Where is that chart? Where’s that chart? Do they have it? I love that chart. Oh, I love that chart. Whoa.
(01:09:47)
That’s one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen. If I didn’t look over there real fast, I guess I wouldn’t be with you tonight, right? I sleep with that chart. I go to bed with it. I kiss it goodnight, “I love you, baby.” That chart.
(01:10:02)
But the word tariff is a beautiful word, if properly used. And it gives us power, strength, and beyond just economic strength. There are times when I had two countries fighting. I won’t to tell you which ones because, but I had two countries fighting. It looked like they were going to go to war again.
(01:10:20)
I think Rick Grinnell is here. Is Rick Grinnell here? I think so. Did a fantastic job. Yeah, they’re fighting. I said, “Fine, if you guys want to fight. You want to kill people in your countries, that’s okay. But if you do, I’m going to charge you 200% tariff to do business with the United States.”
(01:10:36)
And that’s it. They called me back two days later, “Sir, we’ve made peace. After years, we’ve made peace. So, it really does. It has a great power to it. There’s a great power if you know how to use it.

Marsha Blackburn (01:10:49):

Well, it does indeed. And another thing with great power was the 2017 Trump tax cuts. And we need Republicans in the Senate and the House to make the Trump tax cuts permanent.

Donald Trump (01:11:05):

Right. She’s right. They want to raise your taxes. They want to take out the Trump tax cuts, which will I think close to depression time, not recession, but depression time, because it was the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. And you got a lot of other things too. Estate tax, death tax. If you love your children and you want to leave your business to them or whatever, does anybody not love their children? Because if you don’t love your children, then it doesn’t help you too much.
(01:11:39)
But if you want to leave, but leave it to anybody, but you had no, zero estate tax. You had zero death tax, we call it. Sometimes I like the word estate better than death, but a lot of people use the word death. And that was a big thing because you would have a farm, and you’d leave it to your children, and they have a big tax to pay. They’d go out to the bank, they’d borrow the money. They’d end up losing the farm and living like hell.
(01:12:06)
And part of our tax cuts, nobody even talks about it. But the people that are involved in this stuff really say that’s one of the best things. You have no estate or death tax to pay. So, it’s really good.

Marsha Blackburn (01:12:18):

Well, we’re going to-

Donald Trump (01:12:19):

They want to end that.

Marsha Blackburn (01:12:20):

We’ll lower those taxes. We’ll have those tariffs. We’re going to make those cars right here, and then see them loaded on a Teamster-driven big rig and taken all across the country.

Donald Trump (01:12:37):

And thank you to the Teamsters. Did you know I got 60% of the vote with the Teamsters? So thank you, Teamsters. That’s the first time that happened in a long time.

Marsha Blackburn (01:12:48):

Yes, it is. Okay.

Donald Trump (01:12:50):

Thank you, Teamsters.

Marsha Blackburn (01:12:51):

Our next question is from Ashley. Whoops, stepped on that water bottle.

Ashley (01:12:56):

Hi, Mr. President.

Donald Trump (01:12:57):

Hi.

Ashley (01:12:58):

Thank you so much for coming to Michigan. My name is Ashley, and I work at the Chrysler plant. Like many auto workers, I am deeply concerned about the future of our industry with many jobs being outsourced as we speak. What actions will you take to ensure that our jobs stay in America so we can continue to build the best cars in the world here in Michigan?

Donald Trump (01:13:20):

So, pretty much as we’ve been saying, and what I want to do is I want to be able to, look, your business, years ago in this area, I was honored as the Man of the Year was maybe 20 years ago. And the fake news heard about it. They said, “It never happened. It never happened.”
(01:13:38)
And I didn’t know who it was. It was a group that honored me as Man of the Year. The faker is back there. See the fake news. But they said, “Oh.” And they looked, and they said it never happened. But I said, “I swear to you it happened. It did happen. I was Man of the Year.”
(01:13:57)
And I came and I made a speech, and I said, “Why do you allow them to take your car business away? Why do you allow it to happen? They’re taking your business away.”
(01:14:05)
And I didn’t know too much about, all I know is they were taking your car industry away from you. They said it never happened, and lo and behold, somebody said, “I remember the event.” And then we found out, and we had everything. We got the awards, we had everything. It did happen.
(01:14:22)
But I gave a speech, which at the time was pretty controversial. We can’t let them take your car business away. It’s such an important business. And it’s an important business even in times of war where they switch over. And it was really something. And I looked at that speech from, I don’t know, it’s like 19, 20 years ago. And I could repeat it now without changing a word.
(01:14:47)
You cannot let foreign countries, and a lot of the times our worst foes are our so-called friends, okay? Our friends, the European Union takes tremendous advantage of us. As an example, they give us cars by the millions. We don’t have too many Chevrolets in the middle of European cities, okay? European Union is brutal. They don’t take our farm products for the most part. They don’t take a lot.
(01:15:15)
But unlike Kamala, who always complains and doesn’t do anything, I keep saying, “Why don’t you do?” I saw Marsha the other day. Why didn’t she do it four years ago almost? And I say that. She’s on the border today trying, [inaudible 01:15:32]. What a day for the border. She goes to the border today, and they just announced just before she got up to speak that more than 13,000 murderers from jail, solitary confinement, people in many cases were released.
(01:15:48)
But I just say, let’s go back. So, we can’t let them take our businesses. We’re not going to let them take our businesses. And you can control that so easily through good policy. Not her kind of policy, by the way. She changed her policy 15 times, “No fracking. Oh, I like fracking.” Defund the police. She wants to defund the police. Now, “Oh, I love the police,” all of a sudden.
(01:16:12)
By the way, when anybody is into defunding the police, even for a day during their career, they can no longer serve as President of the United States [inaudible 01:16:25]. So, we’re not going to let them take our businesses. And really, a lot of that’s determined by our taxation policy. When China has to pay all that money. The people that liked me the best were the steel companies because I saved them.
(01:16:40)
They were dumping China, and others, but mostly China was dumping steel in here at levels that nobody had ever seen before. And it was putting the steel companies out of business. I put a 50% and 100% tax on the dumping of steel, and the steel companies thrived. I saved them. And you have to have the steel companies.
(01:16:59)
So, we’ll do the same thing. And you don’t worry about, here’s what you have to do. I only ask you to do one thing, and then you can sleep beautifully all night long. Go to a job you love and get a lot of money at the end of the week. You know what the thing is? Vote for Trump. If you vote for Trump, everything’s going to be good.

Ashley (01:17:19):

There you go.

Donald Trump (01:17:19):

Everything is going to be taken.

Marsha Blackburn (01:17:24):

Right. And we have Todd. We’ve got another question over here.

Donald Trump (01:17:29):

Hey, Todd.

Marsha Blackburn (01:17:30):

Todd is over here. Right there. Okay. He’s got his microphone. Todd?

Todd (01:17:34):

Welcome, President Trump. First off, I want to say you and your family are in me and my wife’s daily prayers.

Donald Trump (01:17:42):

Thank you.

Todd (01:17:42):

May God continue to watch over you.

Donald Trump (01:17:47):

Thank you very much.

Todd (01:17:50):

So, my name’s Todd. I’m from Shelby. Unfortunately, pretty soon over 2,000 people will be laid off from my plant that I’ve worked at for 25 years. And we can’t take-

Donald Trump (01:18:02):

Where are they moving? Where are they moving?

Todd (01:18:03):

We don’t know. Actually, we don’t know.

Donald Trump (01:18:06):

Probably Mexico, by the way.

Todd (01:18:08):

Oh, the people? We don’t know where the people are going.

Donald Trump (01:18:10):

Where’s the plant going to move? Do you know?

Todd (01:18:13):

The plant’s staying there. We’re losing the Ram Classic, as you probably heard. We make the Grand Wagoneer. It’s a beautiful truck, but we’re waiting on product.

Donald Trump (01:18:22):

You know why? Are they being laid off? And is the plant closing?

Todd (01:18:26):

The plant’s not closing. The people will probably be dispersed between other plants, we hope. But yeah, that’s happening in the next couple of weeks.

Donald Trump (01:18:36):

That’s terrible. Okay, I get it. Thank you. Go ahead.

Todd (01:18:38):

We can’t take four more years of Harris. And my question to you is basic. It’s easy. What is one of your all-time favorite American cars?

Donald Trump (01:18:50):

My all-time favorite what?

Marsha Blackburn (01:18:51):

What is one of your all-time favorite American cars?

Donald Trump (01:18:56):

Okay. So, my father was a great guy. I learned so much from him. And he loved Cadillac. I have to… I mean, his biggest luxury in life was to get a brand-new, dark blue Cadillac every two years. And he would. He would get that car. He said, “Look at this car.” He didn’t know about a Rolls-Royce. He didn’t know. All he liked was Cadillac.
(01:19:25)
And I love it. I think it’s a great car. I think it’s, right now it’s really, it’s come a long way too because it’s come through some problems. But it’s a very good car. I buy a lot of them for different clubs and things and it’s great. And they’re very nice people that run the company. But my father liked Cadillacs, so that’s good enough for me. Does that make sense? Good.
(01:19:47)
And we’ll take care of your situation. You watch what happens. When I do that, and they’re going to be better positioned, because I see what’s happening with the layoffs. But they’re going to be making also, that’s a good, I don’t know what you call it, car. In a way it’s a car. What would you call that? Pretty much a car. They’re going to be making more than they’ve ever made in a very short period of time. You have one thing to do. You have to elect a person with business talent and common sense. And this whole thing is going to turn around very quickly. Very quickly.
(01:20:27)
Thank you very much. Great question.

Marsha Blackburn (01:20:30):

Mr. President, they have loved having you here in Warren, Michigan. And I think you’ve got 5,000 people here and even more outside that have wanted to get in and cheer for you and be here to support you. And they do love you. Absolutely.

Donald Trump (01:20:55):

Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.

Marsha Blackburn (01:20:57):

And everybody is going to be working hard and pulling for November 5th. And we’ve got great questions that have come from the audience tonight.

Donald Trump (01:21:09):

Good.

Marsha Blackburn (01:21:10):

And we’re just so excited that you took your time to come here to a great all-American city and talk with a whole bunch of auto workers and let them know you are on their side and you’re going to make manufacturing great because you believe in them.

Donald Trump (01:21:31):

I do. I do.

Marsha Blackburn (01:21:32):

Thank you all.

Donald Trump (01:21:33):

Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you very much. So nice. Marsha, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you, darling. Beautiful. Thank you, everybody. Have a good time. Get out and vote. Get out and vote. We’ve got to win this one. Thank you. Thank you.","Warren, Michigan","2024-09-30",2,5,0,4,1,0,1,4,0,0
"17",17,"Trump Holds Event in Prairie Du Chien, Wisconsin","https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-holds-event-in-wisconsin","Donald Trump (00:34):

Well, thank you very much everybody. This is great. I want to just thank Derrick, who is an incredible congressman, so respected in Washington. He’s really respected. And I don’t know if there’s somebody running against him or not. I guess there probably is. Will you make sure he wins, please? Okay. Totally respected by everybody. And I’m thrilled to be back in this beautiful state. I love this state. I just gave you the biggest… Before I left, I gave you the biggest shipbuilding contract in the nation, and a lot of other states are angry at me. You know that, Derrick. You know where it is, right?

Derrick (01:16):

Yes, we do, sir.

Donald Trump (01:17):

That’s a big one. And they’re doing a beautiful job too. But I gave you the biggest, and a lot of states aren’t so happy with that. They still remember that. But I just want to really… I appreciate it. These are hard- working, beautiful Americans, and it’s something special. But outside we have thousands and thousands of people. Would anybody love to give up their seat? So we were going to have a thing outside some place in an area where we could have held the people. And I would say… What do you think? 40, 50,000 people, at least, out there. This went almost all the way to the airport and it looked like when Lindbergh landed in New York. Do you remember that?
(02:03)
He had all the way, the Broadway, the way they used to do it, and this looked like it, but thousands and thousands of people, and they all could have had a lot of fun. Instead, now they’re probably leaving and walking back home because we have a nice little room that probably holds 1,500, 2,000, maybe less. And outside you have 40, 50,000 people because the administration couldn’t give us the Secret Service necessary because they’re guarding… Because they’re guarding the Iranian president who’s looking to kill Trump. Can you believe it?
(02:48)
Now, we could add 30,000 for it. You see it. It’s unusual that you see something like that. Yeah, we’ll call in the National Guard. That’s a very good… He’s a smart guy. Stand up. I want to see what that guy… Very smart. A very good idea. They could have done that, come to think. But I think it’s a disgrace. I think it’s a disgrace. But nonetheless, 38 days from now, we are going to win Wisconsin. We’re going to defeat Kamala Harris, and we are going to make America great again. Thank you for being here. Thank you. Thank you, fellas. That’s great. Great job.
(03:31)
They’re making your jobs much tougher, right? Your jobs. Oh, that’s nice, people. Looking… Oh, look at the people behind. Are they relatives of yours, chief? I don’t think so. Oh, that’s nice. Wonderful. Well, you got a lot of killers in our country. You saw that yesterday. Last night after four straight years of obliterating our border, I watched this show that she put on, four years of the most incompetent border anywhere in the world in history. Kamala Harris traveled to the scene. In fact, she stood near where I put up border wall. That was her backdrop.
(04:16)
And in one of the most heinous crimes ever committed by any administration in American history, that’s what she did by allowing these millions of people, millions and millions of people, to come through our border and make our civilization very unsafe. It’s a civilization, very, very unsafe. It’s a heritage. Border Czar Harris went to the border to lie in the most shameless and horrible way possible at the very site where she released so much suffering, misery, and death. There’s no greater act of disloyalty than to extinguish the sovereignty of your own nation right through your border. No matter what lies she tells, Kamala Harris can never be forgiven for her erasing our border, and she must never be allowed to become president of the United States. She must never be allowed. And Wisconsin, you can’t do it, can’t do it. What she’s done is a total disqualifier. What she’s done… And so much death has already taken place.
(05:32)
And we have some people up here, and a friend of mine in particular, who suffered greatly because of it. And this has already taken place by the hundreds, but it’s going to take place by the tens of thousands according to explosive data that was just released yesterday by ICE. And they’ve never released this before. They never talk about deaths and how many… They talk about certain things, but they’ve never released this kind of information. But it was so bad, never done. But under Kamala Harris, more than 13,099 convicted murderers… So these are people that have gone through the system. They’re convicted. They’re in jail for life, some are getting the death sentence, but instead of that, they’ve crossed our border. They’ve been taken out by their countries and set free into the United States of America so they’re free to kill again. Oh, they’ll kill. These are killers.
(06:34)
These are killers that… At a level that nobody’s ever seen. Not even your great law enforcement has ever seen people like this. They got a dose of it, though, recently. They got a dose of it. Their jobs have become a lot tougher. And you remember when they say, “No, no, these are migrants. And these migrants, they don’t commit crimes like us. No, no.” They make our criminals look like babies. These are stone-cold killers. They’ll walk into your kitchen, they’ll cut your throat. Kamala also let in 25,272 illegals convicted for rape, sex offenses, or sexual assault. 62,231 criminal aliens convicted of violent assault. Everything but death happened to the people they assaulted. In total, she let in 425,431 people convicted of… And these are convicted of the worst crimes. They’re criminal aliens, along with an additional 222,000 illegals with pending criminal charges. Many of those charges also are murder, which will add onto your 13,000 murderers that were let into the country.
(07:56)
That’s over 647,572 migrant criminals who Kamala set loose to rape, pillage, thieve, plunder, and kill the people of the United States of America. And they’re not going to change. They’re only going to get worse. They’re only going to get worse. And our law enforcement system, we have the greatest in the world, but our people are told not to do their jobs. “We don’t want you to do anything.” And they come from tough systems. They’re going to love our system. Kamala is mentally impaired. If a Republican did what she did… If a Republican did what she did, that Republican would be impeached and removed from office, and rightfully so, for high crimes and misdemeanors. That would be high crimes and misdemeanors. Think of it, 13,099 murderers, convicted of murder, not like convicted of murder. Some of the worst murders you’ve ever seen. They’re all in our country now, every one of them.
(09:08)
And I’ve been saying this for three years, and the fake news has been saying, “Well, you don’t know that.” Well, now we know it. They’ve never released a list like this, not just on this, they’ve never done it. Over the years, they’ve never done it. She let in… And that’s not even mentioning the rapists, the gang members, the drug dealers, the child predators, and the traffickers in women, in women, mostly women. Joe Biden became mentally impaired. Kamala was born that way. She was born that way.
(09:44)
And if you think about it, only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country. Anybody would know this. And before I knew the numbers, I was saying it for a long time, “They’re coming in. They’re murderers.” I said it so much. They’re from jails. I say jails and prisons. There’s a difference. One’s a little stronger than the other, as you understand. They come from mental institutions and insane asylums. How many times have you heard there’s also a difference there? One’s a little bit stronger than the others. And they’re terrorists. They’re terrorists. They’re terrorists at the highest level. We have some of the greatest terrorists in the world in our country right now. We have no idea where they are. We have no idea anything about them. They could be in Iowa, they could be in Idaho, they could be here because every border is… Right now, running around every state, every state is a border town. Every state is a border state.
(10:54)
They’re flying them in by the hundreds of thousands. Can you believe it? Even yesterday when she was talking about how she’s going to start getting very tough, why didn’t she do this four years ago? And she lies so much. She lies so much. How about… She lies. She said, “Donald Trump ripped the babies out of the crib.” I ripped the babies out of the crib. No, and it was actually President Obama that built the cages. Remember when they were saying, “Donald Trump…” And they show a picture of cages. And then I was lucky enough, somebody from border patrol said, “No, that was in 2014. That was Obama.” And then that story went away very rapidly. Remember? All of a sudden, the cages… The cage story went away when it wasn’t me. No, she lies. Well, look, I mean, the simplest lie is that she worked at McDonald’s, and she never worked at McDonald’s.
(11:50)
She worked at McDonald’s, and I didn’t work there, she didn’t work there. But I’m going to go to a McDonald’s, I think, over the next two weeks. And I’m going to stand over the french fries. She said, “I stood over those french fries.” She never did. It turned out to be a lie. And when I mentioned that, they go, “Oh, he’s fallen into a trap because he…” You ever see that? Whenever I criticize, they say… All the stupid people, the anchors back there, no, they say, “He fell into a trap, her trap.” She can’t set a mental trap. There is no… But if she says something wrong, like in the debate, she said something wrong, I questioned it. She said another thing wrong, I made her look bad. She said another thing… They don’t want me to ever question.
(12:39)
They said, “Oh, he fell into a trap. He questioned the fact on Charlottesville,” which was totally debunked. On all of these stories that were totally debunked, fake stories she mentions. But yesterday, this is one I never heard, that I ripped the baby out of the cribs. No, no. That might’ve been Obama and other people, but it wasn’t us. We had the safest border in the history of our country. And even a sign that I put down, fortunately. I put that sign down and I love that sign. I love the graph. You know the graph? The beautiful blue, gold, and red graph. It’s my favorite piece of paper, perhaps anywhere in the world.

Speaker 1 (13:20):

Thank you.

Donald Trump (13:21):

But she’s so radical. She even wants to legalize fentanyl right away. Fentanyl will kill you. Just a little tiny on the top of a pin and you’re dead. I have so many friends that have lost their children to fentanyl. No, we’re going to do something else. We’re going to get China, that if they send us any fentanyl… I had this deal done with him, but Biden never got it finished. You think he lies awake at night thinking about fentanyl and death? No, I had the deal done, and then we had a bad election. We got more votes than anybody that ever ran for office. Think of it. More votes than any sitting president in the history of our country. We lost by just a little bit. Just a little bit.
(14:07)
I was told if I got 63 million votes, which is what we got in 2016, we got millions, millions, and millions more votes, more than anybody’s ever gotten, more votes than any sitting president has ever gotten. And just by a little bit. No. We got to make sure there’s no cheating. And we’re working hard on that. We got more lawyers, we got more people watching. And I told them, “If we win and when we win, we’re going to prosecute people that cheat on this election.” And if we can, we’ll go back to the last one too, if we’re allowed. But we’re going to prosecute people so at least they know that’s going to happen.
(14:51)
And I said that because we have to have strong borders. You need two things, strong borders and fair elections. And we have neither, but we’re going to do numbers… Too big to rig, right? Too big to rig. And there comes a point when they can’t cheat. And when you see the lines going back, like even today, lines going back for miles to get in. And this lovely building… I don’t want to insult anybody. It’s a lovely building, but if this building were 20 times larger, it wouldn’t be big enough. And why should they do that to all the people that journeyed from all over your great state? When I saw these migrant crime numbers yesterday, first time, first time they had ever been released, they don’t release numbers on murders, but they did.
(15:41)
Somebody probably liked me. They said, “Boy, this is unfair.” But they released them. I said, “This is the real deal. This is something that’s very special. There’s nothing as serious as this.” Nothing can be as serious as this because this gets down to the very fabric of our society, your way of life. I mean, you’re going to be looking around over your shoulder all the time, communities that were safe. This is more important in a way than inflation, which is a disaster in this country. She’s destroyed our middle-class, our senior citizens. This is more important than anything having to do with the economy. We’ll make it better. We’ll make the economy… This is something bigger, in a sense, because this is the fabric of our country. She’s letting in people who are going to walk into your house, break into your door, and they’ll do anything they want.
(16:38)
They’ll do anything they want. These people are animals. She’s released people. These people are animals. Now they’ll say, “Oh, that’s a terrible thing for him to say.” No, no, these people are animals. These are stone-cold killers. They’re heartless, and they wake up the next morning and they don’t even think about what they did the day before. These are real killers. These are real killers. These are the worst. These are people that have been in jail for many years. These are people that killed many people. They took them out of their jails. In Venezuela, their jails are almost empty. All over the world. This isn’t just South America, the Congo, their jails are almost empty. The Congo in Africa, they took them out. They bring them into our country. Many, many countries, their jails are almost empty. Some are empty. Some are much less than that.
(17:27)
I would do it the same thing. I would’ve been better than any of them. I would’ve had everybody out of there. Some of them still have people. They probably couldn’t get buses to get them in. You know you need a lot of buses. But they’re bringing them into our country at levels never seen before. And your law enforcement over here had… You just had a problem here in this beautiful place we’ll talk about. But what they’re doing to us… And I saw that it’s also the fact that they’re taking all of our black populations’ jobs and our Hispanic populations’ jobs. You haven’t seen the real job numbers yet. And I said this also. Two years ago I said, “These people that are coming across the border illegally by the millions are taking the jobs of the black population of America and the Hispanic population of America.”
(18:17)
Have you seen their job numbers recently? They won’t release them, I guarantee, until after the election. But you take a look at the black population job numbers. You take a look at the Hispanic population job numbers. And the unions are going to be next. The unions are going to get hit hard by this. They come in illegally, they take everybody’s jobs, and you don’t know who you’re hiring. Our country is being destroyed. This is the worst president and the worst vice president in history. And you got to get out and vote.
(18:57)
Isn’t this a wonderful and inspiring speech? I got people sitting in the front row. They’re going, “Oh, my God.” They thought they’d be out there jumping up and down. Make America great again. We’re going to do that. Don’t worry. We haven’t gotten to that part yet. No, I’m just saying this is dark. This is a dark speech. But we only heard the numbers yesterday for the first time. I took a lot of abuse because they’re saying, “What does he mean? How dare he say that?” Everyone thinks, oh, it’s such beautiful people. Everyone’s so wonderful coming in. No, no, stone-cold killers, drug dealers, gang members. Every country in the world is taking their worst people, their criminals that are outside of jail, the gangs that hurt people, the drug dealers, which are causing such problems that get death penalties in a lot of countries, and they don’t have the problem with drugs, but they’re taking their worst

Donald Trump (20:00):

… people, they’re bringing them into our country by the tens of thousands. And yesterday, for the first time I saw the numbers, it was reconfirmed. Some of the honest fake news, look at all the fake news back there. Some of them turn the cameras off on when I’m talking about this. No, they turn the cameras… For whatever reason they don’t want people to hear this.
(20:26)
We’re going to make them honest. If we don’t have an honest press, that’s your third leg by the way, you need an honest press, and we have a very dishonest press. Mostly. I mean, I know there’s a little sliver that’s good, but you’re right, right side’s good. He said right side. It’s true, right side. No, you have some good people back there, but it’s true. You have some very good people, but you have mostly horror shows, but small towns in America are terrified of migrants coming in.
(20:58)
And even when they haven’t yet arrived, they’re terrified. They’re terrified. And a lot of these people, they don’t want to talk about it because they think it’s so bad for the town, but they’re going to have to talk because people are being killed. I spoke to people from Iowa, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. They’re beside themselves. And honestly, I tell you, they’re not going to take it much longer. And I guess the easiest way and the best way is on November 5th, you got to vote for Trump because we’re not going to let it happen. We’re not going to let it happen.

Audience (21:31):

Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump.

Donald Trump (21:53):

Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, I love that young voice. Stand up, young voice. What a beautiful person you are. Wow. Thank you very much. We love young people. One of those little things, right? They’re so great. That’s the future. That’s who we’re really fighting for when you get right down, that’s who, right? We’re really fighting for that voice right there we’re fighting. Because we want them to grow up in insanity. This is insanity, what’s happening in our country? Who would do what they’re doing? Who would do this? Who would allow 435,000 criminals? Criminals, hardened criminals.
(22:38)
13,000, think of it, murderers. People that murdered people viciously. Some people murdered many people, and they’re now in our country. They’re not going to change. They’re going to get worse actually. So we are here today in Prairie du Chien. Is that a good pronunciation? You could have given me a little easier name than that, but I think we got it right.

Speaker 2 (23:09):

Got it. Nailed it.

Donald Trump (23:12):

Prairie du Chien, what a beautiful name. And we have to keep it beautiful and you have great law enforcement here, but they’re going through a lot and we’re in Wisconsin and every person here knows exactly what I’m saying. Just this month right here in this beautiful town, police arrested an illegal alien member of a savage Venezuelan prison gang known as Tren de Aragua. These are really bad ones. This vile monster was charged with holding a mother and daughter captive against their will and sexually assaulting them again and again and again. This animal crossed Kamala’s wide-open border along with hundreds of thousands of others that are worse than him, that are worse than him. He was arrested and released in the sanctuary city of Minneapolis. And by the way, I’m going to end all sanctuary cities immediately upon taking office.
(24:23)
Right, right?

Audience (24:23):

USA, USA, USA, USA.

Donald Trump (24:29):

Thank you. All of them are ending. And the people of these states with big sanctuary cities, these people are… I mean, they want them out. It’s only the politicians that want them. Someday we’ll explain why, but he assaulted another woman in the sanctuary jurisdiction of Dane County, and he had outstanding warrants for strangulation all before coming to this small, beautiful, idyllic Wisconsin town, a few months ago in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. There’s a lot of action going on in Wisconsin with these things.
(25:12)
Usually I have like Clark County. An illegal alien released by Kamala Harris was arrested for tying up and blindfolding a twelve-year-old girl in the back of a van and viciously sexually assaulting her. A few weeks ago yet another illegal alien Kamala let in was charged for sexually assaulting a woman in her home in Wausau, Wisconsin. How do you like that? Wausau. Wausau, is that right? Wausau? I like Wausau. No, but think of this, sexually assaulting and what he did to her was so horrific that he’s now facing up to a hundred years in prison, a hundred years.
(26:05)
These are towns and little beautiful areas of our planet that had no problems. Oh, you’re going to have a lot of problems. I don’t care how good your law enforcement is, you’re going to have a lot of problems. They’re all over the place, and I’m telling you what I said before, these towns, these little towns and cities, and by the way, the big cities too, New York, look what’s happened in New York, and they went after the mayor of New York because he was saying, we can’t do this. We can’t do that. They just indicted him for long before he was mayor. But look at what they do. These are vicious monsters in our government that are also stupid people. They’re vicious, but they’re stupid, which is a very dangerous combination. Today, I stand before you to make this promise. I will liberate Wisconsin from this mass migrant invasion of murderers, rapists, hoodlums, drug dealers, thugs, and vicious gang members. We are going to liberate our country. I will liberate our nation.
(27:17)
Our nation will be free again if we win this election and it’s going to have to go fast because we’re not going to be able to handle it. Our nation will be free again and it’ll be free. And I’m the only one that’s going to be able to do it. Nobody else even talks about it. Nobody else even… Did you ever notice the way these people, they don’t want to talk about it. They think it’s bad publicity for their town. It’s bad publicity when people are killed all over the place, they don’t want to talk about it. We will not allow these people to invade us, conquer us, and take all of our dignity and pride and everything we have stood for from the very beginning of our lives.
(27:57)
You have dignity and pride in this town and this area and this state, and they want to take that dignity and pride. They want to invade… They want to take over your homes. They want to take over your buildings. Look at what they’re doing in Colorado. Aurora, Colorado. Venezuelan gangs are taking over real estate. They’re real estate developers like I was, but they do it with a gun. I did it with bank financing. They do it with a gun.
(28:26)
They will save your communities and we will work with your law enforcement. They’re going to save your communities. You get the greatest people on earth and you got to respect them. And when you have good ones, you got to hug them and kiss them and tell them we love you because they’re great. They do so… I am endorsed by every law enforcement group I think or just about. I better say just about because they’ll find some one little person someplace up. Someplace up, someplace. I don’t really like Trump, Trump lied. Now he’s a bad… But virtually everybody, we just had the endorsement of a group of 400,000, the largest group, the largest law enforcement group, the Fraternal Order. She’s got 400,000 people. They said unanimous. I don’t know if it’s unanimous, but all the sheriffs all over Florida, all over the country, every sheriff’s group, everybody, everybody’s endorsed us.
(29:29)
Or if they can’t, they’re not allowed to. In some cases they still state their preference. Border patrol endorsed me and border patrol is like… It’s hard. How do you endorse somebody and you’re with this other group, but they can’t do it. They’re unbelievable patriots. They love the country. They hate to stand there and watch these people pour right by them. They want to do their jobs. They’re great people. How on earth did a small town in the Midwest and America come to be so famous as some of these towns? Look at what’s happening with some of these towns. They’re being talked about all over the world, but in a very horrible way, occupied by members of savage prison gangs from Venezuela. I mean, think of that. You’re talking about areas of the Midwest where they’re becoming famous because they’re being occupied and this is hundreds of little cities and little towns.
(30:26)
They’re petrified and their law enforcement is petrified. You have a sheriff and a deputy, or you have a small group and you’ll have a group of Venezuelan killers, street gangs, occupying the town with MK-47s. I know that gun very well. I got to know it very well. I’ve become an expert on guns quickly. My son’s no guns. They couldn’t believe what the stories they heard. The two stories they heard actually, but I don’t care because we’re doing it for you. We’re going to make our… I don’t care. I just say, we’ve got to do it.
(31:16)
Thank you. Thank you.
(31:17)
I love that guy right in the front. He looks better than I do, and I think he’s probably a little older, right? Look at him. He looks fantastic. Four years ago, I handed Kamala Harris the most secure border in US history with the lowest illegal immigration on record. In the words of former ICE director Tom Homan, you know Tom, “President Trump was the greatest president in my lifetime by far. This country was never better off than when he was there. He was unprecedented in his success on the border, and it saved so many lives. He got it done.” Likewise, the head of the National Border Patrol Council, Art Del Cueto, he’s a great, incredible guy. He said of Kamala’s visit to the border yesterday, “I stood with President Trump when he actually went to the border to areas that are notorious for drug smuggling and human smuggling and are very dangerous. He stood there. He spoke to the agents for a long period of time. He’s been speaking to the boots on the ground for eight years and a lot. He stood there for over an hour in 110-degree temperatures with heat.”
(32:50)
It was a hot day, I will say, but the heat was crazy, but with families of victims and illegal aliens, and he spoke to reporters. Vice President Harris went down there. She didn’t speak to the agents. And as a former president of the National Border Patrol Council, great guy, Brandon Judge said, “President Trump’s actions secured the border. Kamala Harris’s actions completely opened up the border and made it very unsafe.” And I just want you to take a look at this little video. We had a video planned and we’re going to use it even though it was supposed to be for 50,000 people, but maybe they have a little television set outside that they’re watching it. But you have to take a look at this, please.

Kamala Harris (33:40):

I know the importance of safety and security, especially at our border.

Speaker 3 (33:46):

Who really is Kamala Harris. She’s been telling us her entire career.

Kamala Harris (33:53):

I support our sanctuary law.

Speaker 4 (33:57):

The illegal immigrant deported multiple times who stands accused of killing Kate Steinle.

Kamala Harris (34:03):

An undocumented immigrant is not a criminal. Also have the courage to reject that term, illegal alien.

Speaker 5 (34:11):

Are you aware that there’s a perception?

Speaker 6 (34:13):

No.

Speaker 5 (34:14):

Are you aware that there’s a perception-

Speaker 6 (34:15):

… that puts ice in the same category as the KKK? Is that what you’re asking me?

Speaker 7 (34:19):

Abolish ICE.

Kamala Harris (34:20):

Yeah.

Speaker 7 (34:20):

Is that a position that you agree with?

Kamala Harris (34:23):

And we need to probably think about starting from scratch. We’re not going to treat people who are undocumented across the border as criminals. I’m opposed to any policy that would deny any human being public health, period.

Speaker 8 (34:39):

Would you be committing to close immigration detention centers?

Kamala Harris (34:42):

Absolutely, on day one.

Speaker 9 (34:46):

[inaudible 00:34:46] consequences last three and a half years, 10 million illegal encounters. Two million [inaudible 00:34:52]. 600% increase in sex trafficking, more terrorists coming across the border. A record number of people off the terrorist watch list. And over a quarter million Americans dead to fentanyl comes across both border. Consequences, there ought to be consequences for her failure.

Kamala Harris (35:05):

We have a secure border. The border is secure.

Kamala Harris (35:08):

Sickening new details about the murder of Georgia nursing student, Laken Riley. The 22-year-old was beaten to death with a mystery object.

Kamala Harris (35:16):

We’ve been to the border.

Speaker 10 (35:17):

You haven’t been to the border

Kamala Harris (35:19):

And I haven’t been to Europe. And I don’t-

Speaker 11 (35:22):

Kamala Harris. Do you trust her to stop the invasion?

Donald Trump (35:34):

She is a disaster and she’s not going to ever do anything for the border. And she didn’t even want to get tough now, except her poll numbers were tanking. And by the way, we’re leading in the polls. We’re doing great, but you got to get out and vote. This can only happen to me. I had to beat Biden. We were 21 points up after the debate and then I said, oh, I can’t believe it. I think they’re going to get them out. Then we had to start all over again with this one. She had a little honeymoon period, but people are now finding out she’s not a smart person and she has no idea what the hell she’s doing. And she’s going to be dealing with the smartest people. President Xi. How do you think President Xi is looking? He’s jumping. He’s just grabbing his… Oh, he’s so happy.
(36:28)
He’s grabbing his people all over the place and watching the same kind of things you just watched. But even better. And we can’t have this… Look, we had four years of incompetence. We can’t have another four years of incompetence because we’re not going to have a country anymore. She’s incompetent and a bad person. But she’s incompetent. Grossly incompetent. She’s a Marxist. You’re right. She’s a Marxist. Her father’s a Marxist professor. Think of it. Defund the police. She started the movement. This is a woman that we cannot allow to have in this… If she gets in, our country is finished. It’s finished. Starting on her first day in office, Kamala Harris terminated every Trump policy I use to deliver the strongest and most secure border in the history of our country. We never had a… Tom Homan said it, the best border. They interview people on the border that live in hell on the border.
(37:30)
They say it was never like Trump had it. We had a great thing. And then as soon as she came in, it was… She ended up… Remain in Mexico. That means you couldn’t come into our country. She terminated it. You know what it means? Remain in Mexico. It’s what it means. Release and canceled. Little things like the safe third agreement, canceled. Title XLII halted the removal of virtually all criminal aliens, ended all of our programs that we instituted to stop child trafficking, which is at an all-time record now. She said last night that I told you ripped babies out of the crib. I ripped babies out of the crib. She’s sick and she’s a liar. And the reason I keep mentioning McDonald’s, because it was so basic. She worked at McDonald’s and it was a lie. She’s a liar. But Kamala of all things, the worst thing is this.
(38:32)
She lost 325,000 migrant children, and they’re either dead, being sold into sex slavery, or just plain missing from their parents. They were stolen, 325,000. What Kamala Harris… Can you imagine if that were a Republican? Can you imagine? What Kamala Harris has done to our border is a betrayal of every citizen. It’s a betrayal of her oath and it’s a betrayal of the American nation. Not only must she be defeated, but in light of this news, Kamala Harris should immediately resign the vice presidency and go home to California in disgrace. She should resign. Under both Border Czar Harris and Sleepy Joe Biden… Where is he by the way? What the hell? What the hell happened to him? Midwestern states from Pennsylvania to Wisconsin are being overwhelmed through two programs she created to deluge towns just like yours. First, she created a program to fly in migrants from Venezuela, Haiti,

Donald Trump (40:00):

He and Nicaragua dumping them into cities and towns all throughout America, right? You know that, right? Remember months ago on the border a little bit, but they never stopped the flights because they didn’t think. But we caught them about two months ago, flying in hundreds of thousands of people over the border. They didn’t think we’d catch them. Can you believe it?
(40:20)
In addition, she’s allowing virtually unlimited numbers of migrants to enter and be released at the press of a button through her phone app for illegal immigrants. They have a phone app so that people can come into our country. These are smart immigrants, I guess, because most people don’t have any idea what the hell a phone app is, but they do. These are very intelligent immigrants, but you know who they’re really meant for? The cartel people, the people that run the cartels, they can use them brilliantly.
(40:48)
They’re making billions of dollars among the most successful people in the world. This is why I get shot at so much. I mean, if you think about it. Only a consequential president gets shot at, okay? Remember that.
(41:08)
In less than four years, she relocated almost 5% of the entire population of Haiti to the United States, and the rest are coming in rapidly, as rapidly as they can, as fast as they can come out. 6% of the populations of Honduras and Nicaragua, and remember this, those governments, they send the people that want to send, and those are the people we’re getting. These countries are so dangerous that the US State Department has travel advisories warning Americans not to go there. Yet, Kamala is resettling all of those people here, anybody that wants to come.
(41:50)
We have travel warnings, don’t go here, don’t go there, don’t go to the various countries, and yet she’s taken in the worst of those people, the killers, the jailbirds, all of the worst of the people, she’s taken them in. Then I have to sit there and listen to her bullshit last night. Who puts it on Fox News and they shouldn’t be allowed to put it on. It’s all lies. It’s all lies. Everything she said is a lie. But it all stops the moment I raise my hand and take the oath of office as your 47th President of the United States. It all stops.
(42:57)
Thank you very much. Not far from where we are today in a small, very beautiful town of 15,000, Whitewater. Do you know Whitewater? Right up the road a little bit. Kamala has flooded the town with an estimated 2,000 migrants from Venezuela and Nicaragua. Very tough ones, some very tough people in that group. I know because I get the info. Housing costs have now soared by 25% because the government’s buying houses for them. Diseases are spreading like wildfire, all sorts of disease. The police say they cannot handle the surge in crime. The schools can’t teach and they’re taking over the schools, and the town itself has plunged heavily into debt. The town’s in big trouble.
(43:52)
In Springfield, Ohio, 32,000 migrants from Haiti and other countries descended upon this idyllic town of 50,000 people. How would you like to have 50,000 people and now all of a sudden, a short time later, you have 32,000 more. They don’t speak the language, they don’t have the culture, different culture, whole different culture, everything’s different. But yet 50,000 people with no crime, no problems, only happiness, love, not anymore.
(44:27)
The mayor is a very nice man. I don’t know, but he is a very nice man and he doesn’t want to really talk about it, but he’s got to talk about it. He wants to be politically correct, so rather than saying what he should be saying, which is you’re all leaving. You’re not coming in. We’re not going to take you. We’re not going to allow this to happen to our town. Instead of that, he was on television the other day. He said, “No, no, we’re trying very hard to get along with everyone. We are looking for interpreters because nobody speaks English.” I believe he actually intends on keeping the people in the town. The town is ruined. It’s destroyed.
(45:16)
I mean, I am politically correct, but not when it’s this important. Your towns, your cities, your country is being destroyed. This is bigger than inflation, which is killing you, all caused by Biden and Harris with their stupid energy policy and all of their spending on the green new scam. Billions and trillions on the green new scam, on garbage that doesn’t do it, that actually brings our country back. They don’t think about nuclear missiles from different countries.
(45:52)
By the way, they can’t handle them anyway. You’ll end up in World War III, but they think about global warming, which is now called climate change because global warming doesn’t work anymore because it’s actually cooling. It worked for a few seasons, but now it’s not working. Climate change a much better term because that covers everything. Warming, cooling, rain, sun, it covers everything. Trillions and trillions of dollars they waste. They want to go to $93 trillion. That’s more money than every country in the planet and destroyed.
(46:27)
Germany went that way for one year, and now they’re building coal plants all over the place. You know why? Because they were getting destroyed. That’s why Angela Merkel is no longer there. Already, everybody is talking about leaving the different towns that we’re talking about. The majority of the school cannot speak English. In Ohio, Springfield, they can’t speak English. They’re taking over the schools. There’s nobody that can speak English. The mayor’s looking for interpreters. Isn’t that wonderful? How can this happen? How can we allow it to happen?
(47:07)
If Kamala is re-elected, your town and every town just like it all across Wisconsin and all across our country, the heartland, the coast, it doesn’t matter, will be transformed into a third world hell hole. That’s what’s going to happen. A hundred percent. Remember, there’s a hat that’s made that sells like crazy. Oh, there’s a fly. Oh, I wonder where the fly came from. See, two years ago, I wouldn’t have had a fly up here. You’re changing rapidly, but we can’t take it any longer. We can’t take it any longer.
(47:45)
It takes centuries to build up the unique character of the United States of America. Centuries and centuries, goes on forever. Good and bad, it all comes out and we ended up with a great country. But in three and a half years, they’ve really destroyed our country. They’ve really destroyed it and we can fix it. But you know what? In four years, it’s going to be too late.
(48:15)
Just like we’ve seen in London and Paris and Minneapolis and Aurora and Colorado and Springfield, Ohio. But I’ll not let it happen here in Wisconsin. I’m not going to let it happen. You’re not going to let it happen, and I will not let it happen to Prairie du Chien. It’s not going to happen.
(48:45)
I just want to say we’re pleased to be joined by so many great people, but one of them, as I said before, is Congressman Derrick Van Orden, who lives just a short distance away, where a heinous sex assault that I mentioned before took place. It was terrible. Derrick, I want to thank you very much for being here. You’re doing a great job. But they had a hell of a time, right?

Derrick van Orden (49:08):

Yes, sir.

Donald Trump (49:08):

This was from an illegal that came in through Kamala, and that won’t be the last one. It’ll only get worse. It’s going to get so bad that it won’t be sustainable. We have to get these people out. We got to get them out of here. Got to get them out of here fast. Now, the fake news would say, “Oh, he’s such a mean person.” I’m not mean. I’m a good person. I want to take care of… We got to take care of people. We’ve built this over 250 years.
(49:33)
We got to take care of our country. Our country’s being destroyed by these people, and you don’t even know why. Are they stupid? Are they evil? Do they want us to be destroyed? It’s so obvious that it can’t work. It can’t work. I mean, go and take a look at Springfield. Go and take a look. The governor’s a Republican. He’s a nice man. I helped him very much. Without me, he wouldn’t have been elected, but he’s taken an attitude like, “Oh, isn’t it wonderful?”
(50:06)
Look, you got to do what you got to do. You got to get these people back where they came from. You have no choice. You’re going to lose your culture. You’re going to lose your country. You’re going to have crime, the likes of which nobody has ever seen before. Now I’m speaking from common sense. You see, the Republican Party has really become the party of common sense. We need common sense here. I mean, we’re not going to have men playing in women’s sports. The thing is we want to have a border. We want to have a border. We want to have good education. We want to have low taxes. We want to have a strong military. I rebuilt our military, then they give away a big chunk of it to Afghanistan in the single most embarrassing day in the history of our country. The same idiots are dealing with us now on nuclear weapons in Russia and the problems in the Middle East. We have this whole world is exploding.
(51:11)
One of the toughest, smartest people said very nicely. Viktor Orban, he’s the head of a place called Hungary. He said, “If you bring Trump back, everything’s going to be good. Otherwise, this whole world is going to end up in a big fat world war. You’re going to end up having it.”
(51:36)
Also with us, our Crawford County Sheriff, Dale McCulloch. Dale, thank you. Wherever Dale is, thank you, Dale. Thank you. Good job. Prairie du Chien Police Chief, Kyle Teynor. Kyle, thank you very much. Thank you, Kyle. Good job. Wisconsin GOP chair, Brian Schimming. Thank you very much. Where’s Brian? Oh, Brian. Stand up, Brian. Are we going to win, Brian? Okay, good. Brian’s doing a great job. Doing a great job. Thanks, Brian. Good job.
(52:17)
What Kamala did not talk about in her lies last night, just lied, everything was a lie. I always say, “Why didn’t she do it? She’s been here almost four years.” “I’m going to do this. I’m going to do that,” reading off a teleprompter. Isn’t it nice to have a president that doesn’t need a teleprompter?
(52:45)
But I keep asking. I said in the debate, I said, “So why don’t you do it? Why don’t you just do it?” “We’re going to do this. We’re going to… ” She’s been there for almost four years. They didn’t do anything, except destroy our country. Why don’t you do it? Then she says about a bill. It was such a bad bill, this bill that she talks about. You know, it’s a fake bill. It was put in by the Democrats with a couple of Republicans that got duped and put before nobody wanted to vote.
(53:12)
She said, “I’m the one that talked them out.” I wish I had that ability that I was the one that said, “Don’t vote for it.” But I do have a certain say, but I would’ve never voted for that bill. It was so bad. It would’ve allowed everybody to become a citizen. It would’ve allowed at least two million people to come into our country and very rough ones. It was a terrible bill, but they use that as an excuse.
(53:37)
The fact is all she has to do is go back to the White House, wake up Sleepy Joe. It’ll be 4:00 o’clock, so he’s gone to bed and say, “Joe, get your ass down here. I’m going to ask you to do me a favor because I’m losing in the election. Sign this piece of paper.” What is the piece of paper? It says to the border patrol. Close the border, three words. Like I did, and we want people to come in, but we want them to come in legally.
(54:22)
Close the border. “Joe, please sign it. Please sign it, Joe. I need help, Joe. I need help. They’re killing me on the border. I’m losing on the border.” I won in 2016 on the border. It was one of the big things. I mean, I won on a lot of reasons, but I won on the border. I won because I stopped people from coming on and killing our country with trade, the various countries, mostly known as our friends. Our friends can be the worst on trade. They kill us more than our enemies, frankly. They sort of come underneath and all of a sudden you realize, gee, we got taken over.
(54:54)
But I did great on that, but I probably won on the border and I fixed the border and then in 2020, I couldn’t even talk about it and yet I got many, I got millions of more votes in 2020, but I still couldn’t talk about. My people were saying to me, “Sir, they don’t want to hear about the border because you fixed it.” I said, “Well, I want to talk about it.” They don’t want to hear it. It’s true. Nobody wanted to hear it.
(55:15)
Today’s border is 20 times worse than it was in 2016. 2016 was like a great day for this border. 2016, I fixed it. I built hundreds of miles of wall. I had another 200 miles, and that’s much more than I promised to do, 200 miles ready to go. When they took over because of a rigged election, when they took over, they didn’t want anything to do with putting those panels up. You could have put them up. They were laying right there, right next to it.
(55:46)
I don’t know if you heard this story. They had sections where they even said, we have to build a wall. The panels that we put up were exactly what border patrol and ICE wanted. Everything, they even have the anti-climb panel on top, which I hated to look at, but it made it much harder to climb. I said, “Well, do I give up the look for the climb?” It’s called an anti-climb panel and it’s right. It’s very hard to get over the top. These guys can do anything.
(56:15)
What happened is they didn’t want to put up those. So they went out and bought a totally different panel instead of just putting it up, which is nothing by comparison, not nearly as good, not as good in any way. Rather than using the panel that was sitting 10 feet away, they put different panels up. It looks like hell too. Now you have a wall that doesn’t, you know. They say, “Where the hell did that come from?”
(56:39)
But they admit. I always said, for years, I said, everything gets obsolete fast. Like you have a computer and you think it’s great, and then two weeks later it’s obsolete. You have a new cell phone. I love it. I love it. A week and a half later, they come out with a better one. The only things that don’t get obsolete are the wheel and the wall. A wall is never obsolete. But what Kamala did not talk about in her remarks last night were the countless Americans who’ve been brutally assaulted and killed by illegal aliens, and she let them in. Killed, many, many killed, just so many people already. We think this is the beginning. It’s not. This has been going on ever since they took over because from the day they took over, they said, we want an open border and nobody believed them. It wasn’t believable.
(57:29)
Here today is Patty Morin, whose heartbreaking story is a tragic warning of what will come to every city in America with four more years of Kamala Harris. I can’t even believe she’s being considered. Look, she was considered eight weeks ago, the worst vice president in history, a very dumb person. The fake news was calling her dumb, stupid, didn’t have a chance. She was at the bottom of a list of 12 candidates. They voted. She came in last. She fought Joe Biden, Crooked Joe. I call him two names. I call him Crooked Joe. Sleepy Joe. I’m not sure. I’ve never figured out which is better. He said they’re both good. I agree. I actually tried them together, but it doesn’t work together. I sort of interchange.
(58:19)
But think of it, this person, what they’ve done to our country and what’s done to Patty, she lost the most beautiful person, her daughter you’ve ever seen. I’ve gotten to know her. None of this would’ve happened. Just like the war with Ukraine and Russia would’ve never happened if I was president. No chance, zero chance. Putin would’ve never done it.
(58:46)
Just like the attack on Israel would’ve never happened on October 7th, just like that horror show. If you look at Afghanistan would’ve never happened. Inflation would’ve never happened. We would right now be energy dominant instead of looking for energy. You know that our reserves, we have a reserve, and it’s really meant for war. It’s meant for very important things. Strategic reserves, right? Just reported today, they’re at the lowest point they’ve been maybe ever, but they know in 40 years. Because Biden used that to keep suppress the numbers because without that, the oil prices for your car, it wasn’t supposed to be for your gasoline in all due respect. It’s peanuts compared to the amount we’re talking about.
(59:33)
But now we have the lowest strategic oil reserves in the history of our country, we think, or many, many decades. It’s a shame. But Patty’s precious daughter, Rachel, was a 37-year-old mom of five precious children, a beautiful woman who lived in Maryland 1,500 miles from the border. That’s a long way from the border. Earlier this year while Rachel was out on a run, she was brutally raped

Donald Trump (01:00:00):

Murdered by this disgusting illegal alien who was led into the United States by Kamala and her lax law. Every one of might kill her. He would’ve never been able to get in. She stopped every single one of them. She was the border czar. Now, she doesn’t admit that. Whether you call her a czar or not, she was no czar because she really wasn’t a czar. She didn’t give a damn about the border. She never spoke to border patrol. You ever see the agents, all the top people, they never spoke to Biden or her. And yet, it’s like the most important thing. But Patty has suffered greatly. I’ve gotten to know Patty. She’s a great woman and she’s lost an amazing person in her family. Her family is suffering tremendously. But I’d like to ask Patty to come up and just say a few words about Rachel. Please, Patty. Thank you very much. [inaudible 01:00:56].

Kamala Harris (01:00:55):

Thank you. Thank you. I’m not a politician, so I’m not here to give you a spiel. I do want to say vote for Trump though, because I really believe that he’s going to close our borders. Rachel. Rachel was a very fun-loving, down-to-earth, compassionate woman. She worked really hard, she took good care of herself, good care of her children. She loved people. She had a stammering, stuttering problem, so she was bullied when she was a child. So she really has compassion for other people. She was like the American mom. She took care of her kids, she worked hard, and because of this open border, her life was taken away and her children have been robbed of their mother. It’s just we can’t have it. Another four years of Kamala Harris and this story is going to be multiplied by the thousands.

Donald Trump (01:02:09):

Thank you. [inaudible 01:02:19]. I’ll see you later. So unnecessary. Patty, we’re so sorry for the terrible suffering that you’ve had to endure. I’ve had lunch with Patty, we’ve spoken, we’ve spoken to the whole family, and I’ve spoken to many other families, same thing. It’s incredible. It’s incredible. It’s just incredible that a thing like that could happen. No reason for it.
(01:02:39)
Who has an open border where people can… They don’t have the names of anybody. Those 13,000 murderers that are… They don’t have any idea where they are, who they are. They don’t have the names. We just know they’re all out of jails, all convicted of really bad murders. And now they’re in our country. And that’s a lot of people.
(01:03:01)
In honor of Rachel’s life and every other victim of migrant crime, we will win this election, we will secure our border, we will secure that border on day one. I always say… They say, “What are the first things you’re going to do or the first two things you do?” I always say, “Number one, we’re closing our border. And number two, we drill, baby, drill.” But I put drilling behind the border. A reporter asked me that question last night, “What’s the first thing? But I mean the first thing.” I said, “Well, there’s a couple of things.” I said, “I want to hear the first thing.” I said, “You know the first thing? Close the border. The second thing is drill, baby, drill. But I’ll do them at the same time.” We’re going to bring down your costs at a level that you wouldn’t believe because that’s what you have to do. We will give you… Your electric costs here are the highest in the nation. I think you probably know that. We will bring down your energy costs within the first 12 months of my administration by 5-0, 50%. And it’ll be easy. We have more liquid gold under our feet. We’re going to bring down your electric and your air conditioning and your gasoline. We’re going to bring down your energy costs by 50, 5-0 percent, within 12 months of January 20th. So hold me to it. I hope I make it. All right? I hope I make it. You can hold me to it.
(01:04:37)
That, in turn, is going to bring down, everybody, everything else. You’re going to bring down the cost of food, you’re going to bring… Because your food costs have gone. The biggest complaint I actually get is groceries. When you talk to the people, they say… I say, “What’s the biggest problem?” “Groceries.” And it’s true. You look at the cost of bacon, the cost of cereal. These things went up at numbers that nobody’s ever seen before because we have an incompetent administration.
(01:05:05)
I believe she’s more incompetent than Joe. I really do. I believe that she’s more incompetent than Joe. A president’s first duty and sole allegiance is to his own citizens, citizens of his country, and Kamala’s allegiance is to illegal aliens and foreign migrants. That’s what it is. And maybe that’s a Marxist thing. I don’t know.
(01:05:28)
Where is her father? I’d love to speak to him. I’d love to speak to him, because nobody’s heard from him. But I would like to speak to him. My heart is loyal only to the American people. I just feel for the American people. Unless I’m elected, it’s only going to get worse. It’s only going to get worse.
(01:05:50)
Hey, look, you have two people. You had, let’s say, 350 million people. You have no idea how many people you have in this country. Normally, you say we have… We have no idea how many people. They’ve lost control. But let’s say you have 350 million people. Then you had some people running as Republicans and a lot of people running as Democrats. She was the first one out. By the way, I think you had 22 people running as Democrat when they started. Is that the right number, right? 22 people? And she was the first one to quit. She quit the first. She never got to Iowa. And then you had them fade and you end up with Crooked Joe. And that’s okay.
(01:06:32)
I said this is crazy. He’s the one that got the nomination. He got 14 million votes. You know how many she got nothing? Nothing. And everyone said she’ll never get the nomination. But they were afraid because they wanted to be politically correct, so they gave it to her. But she was the weakest person on the whole list. But she’s got the fake news. They’re all fake and they’re behind her. Nobody knows why. I’m sure they don’t know why. They do it out of habit. They do it out of… Because there’s no reason why anybody would be behind her. She’s not qualified. She’ll do a horrible job. She’ll be the worst president. She’ll be worse than Joe, which is hard to believe.
(01:07:08)
The happiest president right now is Jimmy Carter because his administration was brilliant compared to the one we have right now. And it’s a very nice thing. He’s an old guy, but he’s the happiest guy in the world because he was brilliant by comparison to these people. They are the worst ever.
(01:07:27)
On day one of my new administration, I’ll stop all of the migrant flights into our country. Those planes are flying over right now, and they don’t count them in the numbers. I don’t know if you know. They and the phone app, which are thousands and thousands, they’re not counted in the numbers. That’s why they do it, because they don’t want to count it.
(01:07:46)
I will end catch and release. I will restore remain in Mexico. I will bring back Title 42. That’s the medical. I will send in federal law enforcement to rescue every town that has been taken over by migrant gangs and criminal alien thugs. By that time, many of your towns in this great state will be in that position. It’s happening fast. It’s happening fast. And again, the politicians don’t like talking because they think it’s bad publicity. Worst publicity is to let it happen.
(01:08:25)
The governor of Colorado, he’s a Democrat, liberal guy, he’s beside… He doesn’t know what to do. These Venezuelans have come and they’re taken over big parts of his towns, and he doesn’t know… They’re armed with weapons that the military doesn’t even have.
(01:08:41)
We will seal the border. We will stop the invasion immediately. We will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country because we have no choice. No matter what obstacles and dangers are thrown on our path, I will keep on fighting for you and for this country that we all love. That’s why I’m doing this.
(01:09:15)
I tell you what, I had a good life before I did this. Nobody was shooting at me. I had a hell of a life. Oh, those locations, those beautiful… I could have been sunbathing on the beach. You have never seen a body so beautiful. Much better than Sleepy Joe.
(01:09:37)
No, but think of it. Here’s a guy, he’s president Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, he goes to the beach, and then he’s got a lot of cameras. Somebody told him he looks good in a bathing suit. And he doesn’t know. What’s he, 82? It’s hard, generally speaking, to look great, but the mind can be good. I know so many people in their 90s that are sharp. He’s not one of them. He’s not.
(01:10:05)
But think, any guy that can lie down and in front of cameras fall asleep, stone-cold out, and he’s the President of the United States, and it’s a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, he’s laying on the beach and he’s sleeping. I say, how the hell do you fall asleep in front of the fake news media? But see, he can do it. If I did that, I would be… But because they protect him, he can do it. But he’s out cold, and in certain ways I respect it. I wish I had that ability to fall asleep like that. I would love that ability. I’d get a lot more sleep. That would be a good thing. But he goes asleep, stone-cold in front of the media. I never saw anything like it. He’s sleeping. I said, “What the hell? How do you do that?”
(01:10:53)
Honestly, our people don’t want to see him at the beach on a Tuesday asleep. We really don’t want to see that. Our American ancestors shed their blood and tears to build this magnificent land, and we are not going to let Kamala Harris and her party of absolute lunatics like Nancy Pelosi.
(01:11:15)
How about Nancy? Did you see? Did you see this? Crazy Nancy, she’s crazy as a bedbug. Listen, crazy Nancy, okay. Visa announces that they’re under major investigation, major, by the Department of Justice, major, Visa. She owns a lot of Visa stock. They said Nancy Pelosi. She sold it the day before it was announced. One day. Her and her husband. They sold their stock the day before this was announced. Can you imagine if that were a Republican? I don’t think so. Oh, no. It’s terrible. It’s terrible. No, it’s terrible. That they’re allowed to do that is terrible.
(01:12:02)
But you’re the people of America, you’re the soul of America and you will be trampled over no longer. We’re not going to let this happen. We got to stop it. We got to stop it now. I used to say they’re trying to destroy our country. And I always hated the sound of that. They’re trying. Truth is, they have destroyed our country. What they’ve done, they have destroyed. But we’re going to bring it back and we’re going to bring it back fast.
(01:12:25)
In this election, we need record turnout from our small towns. We need the heartland of America to stand up and to rescue this nation. We have so many great little towns and cities. You add them all up and they’re big. They’re big. That’s what I’ve always had. But they’re trying to destroy them. And they’re petrified. I told you. They’re petrified of what’s happening. Even if they haven’t gotten the migrants yet, they’re all coming.
(01:12:49)
We need the entire Midwest to get out and vote in early mail-in voting for everywhere. The Midwest has been so powerful for us. This area has been so powerful for us. You’ve been powerful for us. But Wisconsin. Honestly, any place where there’s honest voting has been powerful for us.
(01:13:11)
When you look at California, which, by the way, she destroyed San Francisco. She was the DA. Then she became the Attorney General of California. She destroyed California, along with Gavin Newsom. You know that Gavin? So I want to ask you to go and vote and really go vote to save America. I believe this is the most important election in the history of our country.
(01:13:41)
With your support, we will get the border shut. We will send the illegals back. We will repel the invasion immediately. It won’t take long. We’ll defend our territory, reclaim our sovereignty, we’ve lost our sovereignty, and restore the allegiance of our government to the people of this country. Together, we will make America powerful again. Make America wealthy again. Make America healthy again. Make America strong again. Make America proud again. Make America safe again. And we will make America great again. We are going to make it greater than ever before. So Wisconsin, get out and vote. God bless you all. I’ll be back. I’ll see you soon. Thank you. Get out and vote. Save our country. Save our country.

Donald Trump (01:30):

Thank you very much. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. And a very special hello to Michigan. We’re going to bring back your car industry.
(01:43)
And it’s great to be back in this beautiful state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots.
(01:49)
Before we begin, I want to just repeat something that just came out over the wires. It’s big stuff by the Patriots of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. You know what that is? That’s ICE. These are tough guys. They’re almost as tough as you. You guys look at us guys, not quite.
(02:14)
Now these are tough people. They love our country, but you need them. But for the first time ever, we have specific numbers. They were just released and it’s about the people that crossed the border illegally under Kamala Harris. Look, that she’s even running is frankly ridiculous. Okay? That’s not a president. That’s not a president. She went to the border today because she went to see if she could, she’s getting killed on the border, and she went to the border. This was a bad day because somebody just released the numbers that came out through ICE. According to this brand new data, never seen before. Over 13,099 convicted murderers have crossed the border and are free to roam and kill in our country.
(03:12)
These are convicted murderers. These are people that were in jail. Now, I’ve been talking about this for three years. When I heard they were opening up the border three and a half years, I said, “If they open the border,” because I know the people on the other side, and they’re smart, savvy people. They’re at the top of their game. Our leaders are not at the top of their game at all.
(03:32)
They never were actually. But our leaders are not. These are smart people. And these are countries from all over the world. 13,000, more than 13,000 convicted murderers have been let out of jail, and they’re roaming our streets, our country all over. And every state is a border state. You know what that means, right? Every state, because they fly them in. Can you imagine? They fly them in.
(03:57)
These people are, I actually, I am starting to think they’re stupid. They’re just stupid. There’s what are, so that’s one, as well. And other numbers came out along with it. Over 13,000 convicted murderers from jails in John. I told you they’re releasing them for jails. And these fake people, these stupid people who said, “They don’t release them from jail.” They do. Mike, they do. You know that you better elect him, your senator, I tell you, as well as over… And these are specific numbers.
(04:35)
That’s why when they rounded them out, I said, I don’t want them rounded out. I want the exact number as well as 25,272 illegals convicted of rape, sex offense, or sexual assault and in jail. These are people all in jail. Because they don’t want them in jail they’re too expensive and they don’t want them in their countries. They’re smarter than us. They give them to us. We’re like a dumping ground. In total 425,431 non-detained, meaning they’re no longer in detention, meaning prison, non-citizens, convicted criminals from all over the world, are right now at large in the United States of America with another 222,141 illegals with pending criminal charges.
(05:29)
And these are serious criminal charges for murder, for drugs being sold all over the world where many people have been killed because those are the ones they put in jail. We don’t do that over here. We give them a fine, every drug dealer kills at least 500 people.
(05:49)
Each drug dealer, him or her kills 500 people. We do nothing about it. We fine them. That’s over 647,572 migrant criminals are in our country. It’s a killing machine. It’s a killing machine, and they’re killing people all over our country. And Kamala said, remember? She said, “Oh, well, those people really don’t kill like our criminals.” No, no. These people make our criminals look like nice people. And I’ve been saying this from the beginning of the Harris Biden disaster. It’s no longer an administration because what they’ve done to our country with this is inexcusable.
(06:35)
I guess some egghead maybe said, “Oh, it’s wonderful to release people,” and it sounds so nice. “We’re releasing migrants into our country,” but these are killers. These are people at the highest level of killing that cut your throat and they won’t even think about it the next morning. They won’t even think about it.
(06:56)
And these people are all over the place and they’re killing people. I could go through the stories and I won’t, but all over. Sometimes they do. They come up, they grab young girls and they slice them up right in front of their parents. Nobodies who’s allowed to do this, and nobody who’s allowed this to happen to our country is fit to be the President of the United States. I mean that too. I mean it. Anybody that stupid. I’ve been saying this now for almost four years because we built hundreds of miles of border wall. We had the best record at the border of any president of anybody, at least in recorded history. Tom Holman would get up. Brandon Judd gets up. They all get up and they say, “There’s never been a president like Trump,” but Tom Holman said it today. He said, “In his lifetime, we had the best border that we’ve ever had under Trump, and now we have the worst border that any country has ever had”
(08:06)
But it’s bad timing for Kamala. Nobody knows her as Harris. You ever used the name Harris? Say Harris. Nobody knows who the hell I’m talking about when I say Harris. It’s true. You say Harris. They don’t know who the hell I’m talking about. So I won’t bother with the Harris. It’s a nice name. I know a couple of people named Harris, they said, but with her, you say Harris, they say, who is that? So we say Kamala, but it’s bad time. She’s incompetent.
(08:34)
Have you seen her? She goes into an interview with Oprah and she can’t answer any questions. She can’t answer any questions. This is bad timing for Kamala to show up today at the border. She didn’t go there for four years. Now, today she shows up and these numbers got released. Somebody doesn’t like her, I think, and the fake news… So I don’t know.
(09:03)
Maybe she’s already gone. I doubt it. But she’s went to the border today. She wants to see if she could salvage, make up some lies, like she said about the border bill that Trump stopped. Let me tell you number one, I didn’t stop it. The senator stopped it, but that’s the worst bill ever drawn. It’s a waste of paper and she doesn’t need a bill. All she has to do is fly back to Washington and yet this president that we have, if he’s still president, I don’t even know who the hell is president. Is he president?
(09:39)
This is not exactly President Xi. He runs this country a little differently, although they do go after their political opponents pretty violently, I will say that. But they don’t go after the murderers. The drug dealers get this guy to sign a little dot. You sign right over the little dots and you sign your name, Joe Biden, and you say on it to border patrol, “Close the border,” and they close the border. That’s what I did.
(10:13)
Our border is open. Our border is open. Nobody can believe it. And I’ve been saying that the people coming in, I know these leaders, so street smart and I would’ve been worse than them because actually Venezuela still has some people in their jails. I would’ve had everybody out into the United States. They probably ran out of buses and planes, but the rest of them are coming. Don’t worry about it.
(10:41)
But all over the world, not just in South America, all over the world, they’re coming from the Congo in Africa. A lot of people coming from the Congo in Africa, and these are serious, serious criminals coming out of jails, mostly from jails, a lot of gang members. They take their gangs off the street. Like in Caracas, Venezuela, the criminals have all been brought to the United States. Their crime rate is down in Caracas.
(11:11)
In fact, I suggest if I lose, I’ll tell you what it’s possible because they cheat. That’s the only way we’re going to lose because they cheat. They cheat like hell. If we lose the next time, we’re going to have the same group of people in Caracas Venezuela because it’s much safer than any place in our country if she wins, much safer. So let’s go to Caracas. It was a very unsafe place.
(11:34)
Now because in Venezuela, their crime is down 72% because they’ve taken their criminals, they’re gang members, they’re drug dealers, and they brought them into the United States of America, and they’re also releasing almost all of their prisoners. Soon the almost will be gone, their prisons will be empty, their mental institutions and insane asylums will be empty. They’re dumping them in our country. And I never had proof. And those fake news reporters back there, they never, they say “Trump, what would he know about that? What would he know?” You know why? It’s common sense. We’re a party of common sense, by the way, just so you know, common sense.
(12:29)
So these numbers just came out. Nobody’s ever seen these numbers for years. Nobody’s ever seen them. And probably some patriot in ICE or somebody just did something. They just said, the country’s going bad. You can’t have a country like that. We have, think of it, murderers, convicted murders, in prison for life. Many get the electric chair or they get whatever their form of death penalty. These are convicted people for life, are now in our country. And I can finally look at them and see. I say, “I told you so,” to the fake news.
(13:12)
These are hard, tough, vicious criminals that are free to roam in our country. And now, for the first time, I can say it, and I mean I knew it before when you have open borders, but they’re dumping everybody in here. I knew it before, but these numbers are actually worse than I ever thought.
(13:34)
They should have been released far earlier so that we could have done something about it. I wish we had them three years ago, but we didn’t. And now we have a problem. And you can’t have her as your president. She doesn’t know what the hell she’s doing. She should resign in disgrace for what she’s done to our country, not run for president. She was the border czar.
(14:07)
She was the border czar. She was in charge. I don’t even care about him. What the hell? No, he put her in charge though. She was the border czar. Now she claims she wasn’t the border czar, but she was in charge of the border. Call her what you want.
(14:21)
Four years ago, Kamala Harris inherited the most secure border in US history and as border czar, she then set the all time record for illegal immigration into our country every single year. And many of these people were stone-cold criminals and murderers. She willfully and deliberately erased her own nation’s borders, a crime so wicked as to defy description as former ICE director and a great man, Tom Homan. Anybody know Tom Homan?
(14:57)
Tom Homan I say is central casting for doing what he does better than anybody. Brandon Judd, Kuwaiti. We have great, great people. These border patrol guys, I got to know them all. They’re great. They want to do their job. They could sit back and let it happen. They go crazy. They see what’s happening to our country and they’re not allowed to do the job. But as Tom Homan just said, just put it out. “I’ve worked with six presidents. I know all about police work and I know all about policies work. I know what policies don’t and don’t work. President Trump was a game changer, and we saved thousands of lives by securing the southern border. Biden and Harris took the most secure border in my lifetime.” This is from Tom Homan, “And unsecured it on purpose.” So he unsecured the border. They did. I don’t know why.
(15:57)
They want the votes. They’re dumb or they want to destroy the country. That could be the only three things. They’re dumb. They want to just have people destroy our country or they want the votes. They’re trying to sign these people up to vote. That’s the all-time insult. They are working full time to sign these people, many of them murderers, to vote so they can cheat on the election because that’s what they do. And they vote against bills. Any bill that wants to secure the vote, the Democrats in Congress fight like hell, so they can’t get passed.
(16:35)
Who would want a bill that says, bad things happen with a vote? You want to secure your vote whether you’re a Democrat… Interesting, a lot of Democrats not the politicians want to have that, and they don’t want to have sanctuary cities, by the way. They don’t want it.
(16:49)
Only the politicians want it for certain reasons. “President Trump,” Tom Homan said, “Was the greatest president in my lifetime.” Thank you, Tom. “This country was never better off than when he was president. He was unprecedented in his success on the border, and it saved many lives. He was an out of the box thinker and he got the job done like nobody else could do the job.” So that’s from Tom Homan. Thank you. I might as well read it. I might as well tell you because they’ll never tell you that. They’ll never tell you that, right?
(17:22)
They’ll never tell you that. Mike, by contrast, Kamala Harris betrayed her oath. She let our cities fail to violent gangs. She let our American sons and daughters be raped and murdered at the hands of vicious monsters. She let American communities be conquered. They’re conquering your communities. You go out to Aurora in Colorado where they’re taking with AK-47’s real estate.
(17:52)
They’re in the real estate development business just like me, except I’d never got to use guns to do it. They’re taking over real estate and Kamala turned cherished small towns into blighted refugee camps. And you take a look at what’s happening in Springfield, Ohio, and the mayor is a nice man. In fact, I think he’s an independent or a Republican, and he doesn’t know what to do and he doesn’t know what to say. He wants to be nice. 32,000 people. You have 50,000 residents. Beautiful place, beautiful, nice town. No crime, no nothing.
(18:31)
They now have 32,000 people dumped into the town, and he’s trying to say, “We’re working very hard to make it comfortable for them.” No, those people have to be taken out and brought back to the country from where they came, I’m sorry. The mayor said, “We’re looking for interpreters.

Donald Trump (19:00):

It’s so hard to find interpreters because nobody speaks English, right? So we’re looking for interpreters. No, no. You’re looking for people that will remove them and bring them back safely to their country. It’s not fair. It’s not sustainable by any country what’s happening to us in the United States. Millions and millions of people, 21 million plus, have been dumped into the United States, and many of them are murderers. Many of them are horrible criminals. What Kamala Harris has done is unforgivable. It’s a crime what she did. It’s got to be criminal. There’s no greater act of disloyalty than to extinguish the sovereignty of your own nation. And that’s what she’s done. She’s ruined our nation. She’s ruined our nation.

Speaker 2 (19:50):

[inaudible 00:19:52].

Donald Trump (19:52):

And I’ve always talked about this and I’ve talked about it strongly, but I’m just realizing as I’m talking right now, and not even going off a teleprompter, because the teleprompter is not tough enough, I’m saying. And by the way, isn’t it nice to have a president that doesn’t need a teleprompter?

Group (20:09):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (20:18):

But I’ve never had … Thank you. Boy, what a group of people we have. It’s a joke. We’re laughed at all over the world for our leadership. But I just got this information, so I’ve never really spoken about this because this is the first time where we have these numbers … 13,000 convicted, jailed murderers, tougher than any of our criminals.
(20:42)
We have only one good thing about this is they make our criminals look like very nice people. These are hardened, horrible criminals, and we have to get them the hell out of our country because they’re ruining the fabric of our country. Kamala is directly responsible for the tens of thousands of crimes committed by illegal migrants that she set free into our country. They didn’t ask for a name. They didn’t ask for a registration number. And many of them don’t even have names or registration numbers.
(21:23)
They just pour into our country. She has no idea where they’re from, from parts unknown. She’s responsible for every bloody crime scene, every funeral, every orphan child. And the great … Mark Levin called me a little while ago and said, “Ask them … ” Because he couldn’t believe the numbers either. He said, “Ask them to ask Kamala, has she ever attended one funeral of the thousands and thousands of people that they’ve already killed?” So I ask you that question. I give that to the fake news so that they can ask that question, because she’s right now at the border giving a press conference. She doesn’t give a press conference. She doesn’t take questions. She’ll make a little statement and then run away.
(22:17)
She delivered these horrors. She unleashed these atrocities and blood is on her hands at a level that probably nobody has ever seen in this country before. But on November 5th, Kamala Harris will be held accountable for these crimes. She will be sent back to California. And we will close the border. We will stop the invasion. We will begin the largest deportation operation in American history. And we have no choice, but [inaudible 00:22:52]. Have no choice.
(22:58)
We have no choice. Our country is in trouble. It’s a mess. It’s a mess. Including the inflation that was caused by them, by energy, and by their spending. But the inflation caused by them by energy. Remember when energy went way down the production after I … By the way, I got more votes than any sitting president in history. I was told if I got the same number of votes as the first time, 63 million, “You can’t lose, sir.” We got many millions of votes more than that. Nobody has ever gotten more votes sitting president, and they beat us by a whisker.

Speaker 3 (23:39):

You won.

Donald Trump (23:39):

It’s the only thing they’re good at. They’re good at cheating in elections. They’re good at nothing else, believe me. They’re certainly not good at policy, policy. By the way, she changed every policy. She had 15 policies that she changed. She was against fracking. She was against everything. And she changed everything because you couldn’t get elected, right? And she was the last one online. Whether you like Biden or not. He got 14 million votes and he won the primers, and then they came to him. Nancy Pelosi, crazy Nancy, she came to him. She’s nuts. By the way, did you see yesterday, two days ago?So I’m not much into this stuff. But Visa crashed because the government went after … The government filed a big suit against Visa. Nancy and her husband sold their stock the day before it was announced.
(24:39)
Nancy Pelosi. So why don’t we get some AG somewhere like in a Republican territory, and why don’t we get them to do a little investigation? Sold the Visa stock. Are you listening? They’re probably turning off the cameras now. They don’t want to report. The day before the government announced a major investigation, the biggest there is, can’t get worse into Visa. They sold it the day before. It’s amazing, isn’t it, huh?

Speaker 4 (25:17):

Insider trading.

Donald Trump (25:18):

I’m proud to say I think I’m the only politician that’s lost. I’ve lost billions on it. I don’t give a damn. I knew I’d lose a lot. I didn’t know I was going to lose that much. I wanted to lose. I could have made a fortune. I could have been like Hunter, sell paintings for $500. I would’ve gotten much more.
(25:36)
Say you got to give me $5 million for that painting. I haven’t painted before, but I have a lot of natural talent. I’m proud to say … I’m not the only one, but I figured I would lose a lot. But I didn’t know I was going to lose that much. But doesn’t matter to me because this is much bigger. This is a much bigger calling. I don’t give a damn.

Speaker 5 (25:59):

Yeah, it is. Yeah.

Donald Trump (26:02):

I don’t … Before going further, I want to send our love and support to all of the people in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Alabama, and all of the other states who have been really hit hard by that very large hurricane. That was a big one, a very large hurricane this week. We’re with you all the way, and if we were there, we’d be helping you and you’ll be okay. 39 days from now, we’re going to win Michigan. We’re going to defeat comrade Kamala Harris. She’s a Marxist, communist, and quite simply, we are going to make America great again, make America great. So I didn’t want to go off on a tangent, but I did want to bring up a little thing called crime. But we’re really here today to talk about bringing jobs and manufacturing back to the great state of Michigan and really to our country, our whole country. And I want to thank … Just met him, a great gentleman. He came here, he said, because of me, in 2017 from the Netherlands, great guy, great successful businessman, Bodawine Housa. Thank you very much. He’s a big guy too, and his beautiful wife. Stand up, please. lease stand up. Good looking couple. Good looking. Good, man, right? Yes? They’re all saying … They better say yes. They won’t be here tomorrow if … No, he’s great. He’s done a great job.
(28:05)
He actually said he came here because of me. He came to the country because of me, opened this, and it was very successful, and I imagine still is. But he said it’s a big difference now between the first days during the Trump administration for four years, three years that you were open during the Trump administration. Now, he says the interest rates are way up and inflation has been very devastating, which it is for everybody, but we’ll make it even more successful than the first three or four years you had. Okay? More successful.
(28:36)
And for generations. This state was the beating heart of American industry. And you gave the world General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, Dow Chemical, General Dynamics, and other giants of American industry and might. Then you see what’s happened to so many of them because of stupid politicians largely, and stupid people that ran the companies into the ground. They didn’t know what the hell they were doing. It doesn’t take much. It only takes one bad executive at the top. But then foolish and corrupt politicians forced Michigan workers to watch as the jobs and the factories were leached from Grand Rapids and Detroit and Lansing and Flint and sent to foreign lands way far away. Not only China, China in particular, but all over. But with your vote, we’re going to reclaim America’s manufacturing power. And basically we’re going to do what they do. We have to get the senators to agree. I think we have no problem with that, right? We’re going to get the senators to allow us to do it.
(29:47)
We’re actually allowed to do it as president. We want to make it permanent. We’re going to bring jobs, wealth and pride back to Grand Rapids, back to Detroit, back to Milwaukee, and all throughout the Midwest, we’re going to bring it back.
(30:01)
And to our incredible auto workers here in Michigan, I’m pinpointing you for greatness. I’m pinpointing you because the industry has been decimated. And right now as we speak, they’re building big plants. They wouldn’t do it when I was president. They’re building big, giant auto plants in Mexico, owned and financed by China, and they think they’re going to come out and they’re going to build cars, and they’re going to sell them into our country, and they’re going to destroy Michigan and all these other places. Not going to happen because we’ll put a hundred to 200% tariff on every car coming across the Mexican border. And we’ll tell them the only … And we are going to be strong. The only way they’ll get rid of that tariff is if you build the plant in the United States, not if you build it in Mexico, which is what China and others do.
(30:58)
If Elon wants to sell a car … By the way, Elon Musk gave his total endorsement. Elon, he gave me that greatest beautiful, most beautiful. He said, “We are not going to have a country left if Trump doesn’t get in.”
(31:13)
And you know what? I’m going let Elon do … Unless you people disagree. I’m going to get Elon, and he’s great at this. He’s going to be our cost cutter. I think he can save trillions, right? He wants to do it so badly. I don’t think I can get him full time because he’s a little bit busy sending rockets up and all the things he does. But he’s so much into that. He said, “The waste of this country is crazy.” And we’re going to get Elon Musk to be our cost cutter. He’s going to do it for zero. He doesn’t want anything, but he wants to see this country be great and he’ll do it. And having his endorsement is a great endorsement. We have some really great endorsements, I will tell you that. But we’ll get him involved and mostly on that side of it, and it’s going to be incredible what he’ll be able to do without hurting anybody, just waste.
(32:06)
It’s waste, fraud, and abuse. Do you ever hear the expression, “waste, fraud and abuse?” You get rid of that, everybody lives much better. We have a country that’s really strong again. If I’m not elected, you will have no auto industry. Your industry is being taken from you like candy from a baby. I see it happening with the all electric. And I’ll tell you, electric cars are wonderful, but not for everybody. I will end the mandate on day one for all electric cars.
(32:44)
And there’s a great place, and they have a place, like Tesla and others. They’re fantastic, but they have a place but not for everybody. They don’t go far. They cost more. And they’re made in China mostly because that’s where they have the materials. We have something that’s even better. We have a thing called liquid gold under our feet, and we’re going to use our liquid gold in the form of gasoline for our cars. Oil and gas. We have liquid gold. We have more liquid gold than any country anywhere in the world. We have more liquid gold, not even close. We have more than Russia. We have more than Saudi Arabia. We have more than anybody.
(33:24)
I approve something, ANWR. I got it done. Ronald Reagan couldn’t get it done. I love Ronald Reagan, but he couldn’t get it done. He tried so hard. It’s in Alaska. It’s one of the biggest finds maybe ever, maybe as big as Saudi Arabia. Nobody really knows, but it’s in that category. One of the biggest in the world, I got it done. I worked my ass off, and I got it done, and Biden came in. He didn’t know what the hell he was signing anyway. And he terminated it. Can you believe this? This would’ve taken care of all of Asia. It would’ve brought money in. We could have paid down our debt. We could have been unbelievable. We would’ve reduced … I gave you the biggest tax cuts in history. I would’ve given you a bigger tax cut, and we still will.
(34:10)
Biden rejected it.

Speaker 6 (34:13):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (34:13):

They ended it in his first day in office, but we’ll get it done quickly. It was already passed by Congress. They didn’t do that. They just ended it. And the people of Alaska aren’t happy. But that’s a national thing. And when you get into those numbers, that’s national. Would’ve been so great for our country, but we’ll get it done very quickly. Under my plan, American workers will no longer be worried about losing your jobs to foreign nations. Foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America because we’re going to take a lot of those companies back, a lot of new companies coming in.
(34:52)
I want German car companies to be American car companies. I want them to build their cars in this country, not in Germany. I want Asian electronics companies to become Michigan electronics companies. And I want every manufacturer that has left us to be filled with regret … And you’re going to become racing back after we do what we’re doing. And here is the deal that I’ll be offering every major company and manufacturer all over the earth, and they’re going to all come in because we are the pot of gold. But we’re not going to be the pot of gold forever if we don’t be careful. We’re not going to be. It’s going to end and we’re not going to let it end. We will give you the lowest taxes, the lowest energy costs because we have the energy, the lowest regulatory burden. I cut regulations more than any other president in the history of our country. And we’ll give you free access to the biggest and best market on the planet.
(35:56)
That’s us. But only if you make your product here in America and hire American workers. If you don’t make your product here, then you will have to pay a tax or tariff when you send your product into the United States, and we will take in hundreds of billions of dollars into our treasury and use that money to benefit the American citizens. So with China as an example, I took in hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes and tariffs. No other president took in 10 cents. In fact, they left it on because they can’t get it off because it’s taken in so much money that the Biden people … I’m sure he doesn’t know about it too much. But the Biden people said, “We can’t get rid of these tariffs. They’re making too much money.” But what they’re also doing, maybe more importantly, their cars aren’t coming in and they’re not destroying Detroit and South Carolina and North Carolina and Georgia and all the other places that are involved with making autos and parts.
(37:06)
They’re not coming in. And we made a fortune on it. And now all we’re doing is taking … We were ready to do that. And then we had a little strange election result. I’m not going to let that happen again. In my first term, I ended NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made and replaced it with the USMCA, the best trade deal ever made. I withdrew from the job-killing Trans-Pacific partnership. By the way, if that deal would’ve been approved … It was negotiated by Barack Hussein Obama. Have you heard of him, Barack Hussein? Remember Rush Limbaugh Rush, we love Rush. He used to go, “Barack Hussein Obama.”
(37:49)
Mr. Wall, would you please stand up? Look at this guy. I got to get a suit like that. He’s

Donald Trump (38:00):

He’s a successful guy. He’s been to 293 rallies. This isn’t a rally. This is a workers’ meeting talking about bringing our jobs back into the country, which will go so fast but he’s been great. Have I done a good job? Yes. You better say yes. That’s it. Thank you very much. Great guy. I renegotiated Barack Obama’s Korea trade deal, which was a disaster, to restore the protective tariff on foreign pickup trucks.
(38:33)
The pickup trucks is where the car companies make most of their money because we put on a tariff and we kept the tariff and therefore they can’t compete with us in our country. And we actually make pickup trucks in this country, if that would’ve gone, called the chicken wire tax, if that would’ve gone out, you would not have any trucks being made in this country. I stood up to China like never before, placing a 27.5% tariff on all Chinese automobiles, saving the US auto industry from total obliteration. The cars don’t come in because they can’t compete. And for furniture makers in North Carolina and other places, and in particular right now a place called Grand Rapids.
(39:21)
I have great memories of Grand Rapids. I came to Grand Rapids. I made a speech. I went home and we ended up winning the election in 2016, right? But I put a 22% tariff on Chinese furniture. They were destroying North Carolina. They were destroying your furniture areas where you have a lot, just absolutely destroying. And you make better furniture by the way, I bought a lot of furniture. Here, I’d go down to, with hotels as I built hotels, I’d buy furniture. I’d go do it myself. People don’t believe me. Were you really buying furniture? Yeah, I’m buying furniture, a lot of it.
(40:06)
But I’d go and it was like North Carolina was a furniture capital of the world, and then it was decimated by China because politicians allowed that to happen. It should have never been allowed to happen. We’re going to bring all those companies back and then we’re putting a tariff on China. We’re selling their furniture here so that these people can make their furniture. They’re better than anyone else. I bought some of that Chinese furniture and people would sit down in a chair and the chair would break and they’d end up on their ass and then they’d sue me. I never had that with North Carolina. I never had it with Grand Rapids. No, it’s true.
(40:43)
This was not good. Ladies and gentlemen, the finest hotel in the world, they opened, they ended up getting a little damaged. They sit down to dinner at the beautiful dining table and they end up getting damaged. Sir, you have a problem. The chairs break. That’s a big problem. The centerpiece of my plan for a manufacturing renaissance will be a 15% made in America tax rate, so pretty simple. So listen to how simple it is and how good it will be. It’ll totally turn our country around and we’ll be a profit making machine instead of a disaster like we are right now with 36 trillion in debt. So I brought the business tax rate from 39% or higher down to 30 to 21%. So it was 39, but it was actually 50 and over 50 if you include state and city taxes in some places, like hopefully New York is going to be able to reduce their taxes, but it was very high, so I brought it down from 39% down to 21%, all the way down to 21%.
(42:04)
People said, “There’s no way.” I got it approved by Congress. Can you believe that? Now they’re trying to, Democrats want to raise it and they don’t know. It’s hard to say, “Would you please vote for me to raise the tax?” They’re going to raise it up to 39 or 40% or maybe even 50%. You better not let these people get in office, they’re going to destroy what we built. And we did more business and created more jobs than ever before in history. With a 21% rate as opposed to a 39% rate we took in more money, much more money, at the lower rate than we did because we had jobs like never before. We had business never before. Maybe you came here because of that. That might be the reason, come to think of it, thank you. You told me that, 2017, yeah, you probably came because of the tax and the one-year depreciation and you buy something and you can depreciate. Oh, you are a smart one. You’re a smart one.
(43:00)
Come to think of it, I would imagine that’s why, and we’re doing that again, the one-year depreciation, you buy equipment and you’re allowed to write it off first year, but what it does is create tremendous jobs. But now I’m going a step further. I’m going to bring down the 21% to 15%, and we will be the most competitive in the world. Don’t forget the world, like a gentleman like this can take his company and go to the Netherlands and go to a lot of other places, they all want your business. So if you start charging them too much, they’re going to leave. They’re going to say, that’s a nice plant, bye-bye, because ultimately they’re great business people and they’re going to go where they can get the deal. 15% will be almost as low as there is in the world, and yet you got to remember, only if you manufacture your product right here in the USA do you get the 15% rate. So how cool is that? Michigan will be hotter than it ever was in its heyday. It’ll be hotter than it ever was. You have to manufacture the pro… otherwise you stay at 21%, which is okay too, but if you manufacture your product here, you drop all the way down to 15%, making it just about as compelling as there is in the world. Some are a little bit lower, but it’s not this country, but it’ll be among the most competitive in the world. Then I’m imposing tariffs on your competition from foreign countries, which would come in and take your businesses as soon as you built them. And we’re going to put tariffs on so now you won’t be able to worry about having somebody come in and steal your plant and steal your business and close your place and lose your workers and the workers are out of jobs.
(44:55)
All your car factories are going to be coming back. You’ll have more jobs than you’ve ever had in this state. Your car industry will be as big relatively as it was 60 years ago when you were like dominant. It’s not dominant anymore. This is why people in countries are all after Trump. This is why. The only one that has shots fired at them, that throbbing feeling, the only one are consequential presidents. When I do these things, I’ve got a lot of enemies out there. I’ve got a lot of enemies. Germany liked, as an example, Barack Hussein Obama better than me even though the people actually liked me much better because you know what? He didn’t charge them anything. He let him rip off our country. All presidents let our country be ripped off and that’s why we’re in the mess that we’re in. But me, no.
(45:53)
But that’s why I have to put it mildly, in particular Iran, don’t forget with Iran they were the sponsor of terror like nobody else was the sponsor of terror and they were broke under the Trump administration because I put all sorts of sanctions on. Countries couldn’t buy their oil or they couldn’t do business in the United States. And all I wanted was one thing, one thing. Because I wasn’t looking to hurt them, I know many Iranian people, they’re great people, very smart people, but I didn’t want them to have a nuclear weapon. They can’t have a nuclear weapon. Very simple ask. You can do whatever you want. You’re going to be strong. You’re going to get big and beautiful. Can’t have a nuclear weapon and destroy the world. Can’t have it. You can’t have a nuclear weapon. The power of nuclear is so monumental, you just can’t let that happen and it wasn’t going to happen.
(46:54)
And there was no Hezbollah that was getting money. They had no money. Hamas had no money. The terror groups, 28 different terror groups, had no money. Nobody had any money. And during the four years of the Trump administration, we had no terror. We had no wars against other countries, expensive, never-ending, stupid wars like we had under other presidents. I won’t say which one.
(47:25)
Including Republicans, including Republican presidents, right? Goes in, blows up the Middle East, comes back, you get nothing except death. You get death all over the place. Death and hatred. Actually they should like me more than anybody ever, but you had no wars under Trump except I defeated ISIS, which had already begun. I defeated ISIS, took 100% of the ISIS caliphate, 100%. I was told it was going to take five years. I did it in four weeks. We have the greatest military in the world, but you have to understand, you can’t be so politically correct, but we did it in four weeks. ISIS was gone, 100% of the ISIS caliphate and some of you have heard the story, but I don’t have enough time to tell you the story because I have to be someplace else making the same damn speech in a little while.
(48:26)
I’ll tell you the story the next time. I promise I’ll tell you this story, Mike, the next time will you come up here, Mr. Senator, come up here real fast. Come on. I got to get you up. This is a man who’s going to be one of the best senators, toughest senator and great for you and I hear your poll numbers are looking good. Will you say a quick hello so I don’t have to go through this process in 15 minutes?

MUSIC (48:55):

Yes sir, Mr. President. Well thank you Mr. president for being here. How about that? And I can tell you I’m looking at his teleprompter, he’s not even close to watching that teleprompter. I want to tell you this, Mr. President, one thing we know here in Michigan with your plans to make sure that border is secure, with your plans to make sure the tax rate allows us to be competitive, with your plan to make energy independent here in America and bring down our gas prices and our cost of groceries, these folks right here, were ahead of you, there is more common sense on that dais than there is in every committee room back in Washington. DC.
(49:42)
And we had some hot off press information yesterday. Mr. President, 5,000 auto dealers, your opponent, Kamala Harris has been saying, really wasn’t an EV mandate. 5,000 auto dealers who are feeling the heat from this EV mandate said, “Nope, you’re killing our business. You’re killing the automobile industry. You must end the EV mandate.” With you in Washington, we’re going to get that done. Thanks for being here. Mr. President.

Donald Trump (50:14):

He’s doing great. You got to vote for him. He’s doing great. And Tudor, thank you very much. Great job. You did a great job this morning on television. I appreciate it very much. Nice things. Tudor Dixon everybody, thank you very much. But if Kamala Harris gets in, every single manufacturing job in this state is going to Mexico or going to China. And Mexico is a very big threat, by the way.
(50:42)
First of all, the tax queen, that’s Kamala, is demanding a 33% tax hike on all domestic production, way up. It’s going to be much higher than that by the way. Next, she wants the largest capital gains tax in the history of our country. And then she’s promising a brand new wealth confiscation tax called unrealized capital gain. That means that if your company’s doing great and your company’s gotten really valuable, but you might be a little tight on cash and you have no intention of selling your company, you do an appraisal of what your company is worth and you have to pay a tax on it.
(51:23)
So now you go to a bank and you borrow the money and your company goes out of business and that’s the end of your company. Can you imagine that? Unrealized. Unrealized, in other words, you don’t sell, your company got more valuable and you’re putting more and more money into your company and that’s okay. There are a lot of people have great wealth and they don’t have cash. Those people are wiped out and it’ll cause a depression like in 1929. Other than that, I think it’s quite a good idea.
(51:50)
Crazy, this person, crazy. Her father is a Marxist professor of economics. That’s what she is. She’s a Marxist and we are not ready for a Marxist and we will never be ready for a Marxist or a communist president, which is what she is. And we’re leading in the polls. We’re doing great, but when you see we’re leading by two points, three points, we should be leading by 50 points. We should be. How the hell? Really, you would really say, why would anybody vote for her? She’s destroying our country. What she did outside of the nuclear disaster that these people will get us into World War III, what she did on the border with these millions of murderers and criminals coming into our country, what she did on the border is the worst thing I think I’ve ever heard. I’ve never heard of anything like it never made sense.
(52:52)
In business you always like to figure out your opponent. What does he want? What are they doing? What does she want? What are they doing? And you want to figure it out. Here you can’t figure it out. Why do they want open borders? Why do they want men playing in women’s sports? Why does Kamala want to give transgender operations to convicted illegal migrants coming in and staying in detention cells?
(53:23)
She said, “We will give them sex change operations.” Now, somebody would look at me and say, “That’s crazy. I’m sure that that’s not true.” No, no, it’s a hundred percent true. She wants to, wanted to, wants to give them… They’re in a detention cell and a man wants to transition into womanhood and she’s willing to do that and give very expensive operations, by the way, hundreds of thousands of dollars. But if you want that, she will give you a transgender operation. Are we crazy? Now, how about, and also, all of these people, she wants to defund the police. She is one of the originals for defund the police. I say anybody that wants to defund the police is not qualified and shouldn’t be allowed to even run for President of the United States. It’s crazy. Comrade Kamala Harris also voted for a bill to impose a one hundred-percent ban on gas-powered cars and trucks killing an estimated 200,000 US auto jobs, including 40,000 auto jobs in Michigan, A death sentence for the Michigan economy.
(54:54)
On day one, I will terminate Kamala’s electric vehicle mandate, have to terminate it. And remember, the electric car has a great place, but not for everybody. Okay, not for everybody. No state in America will be permitted to ban gasoline engines. You want gasoline, nice, clean gasoline, we have the best, we have the most. We want to use something that China has that we don’t. It’s crazy, right? They have certain minerals, they have control of what you need for the batteries, and we really don’t, but we will have. A lot of what we have is stopped because of the environment.
(55:37)
We have the minerals, but we don’t have the environmental impact statements. But we’ll make sure that that’s going to go very quickly. We’ll be able to do things that you never even thought. The only good thing about what happened with this four-year disaster is that the people will understand when we fix our country, there’ll be much more understanding than there would’ve been if we just went straight ahead and did it. Because this country has never been laughed at a bunch of dopes. It’s never been laughed at like it is right now.
(56:06)
If Kamala wins, she will take your cars, take your money, take your gun. She wants to confiscate all guns, you know that. She just changed. That’s one of the 15 policies that she changed. She was totally in favor of taking everybody’s, confiscating your gun. She changed that when she looked at some polls. The polls weren’t looking too good, but they always revert back. Remember, she wants to take your economic opportunity and she will absolutely kill the American Dream for your children. This country used to be about the American dream. They don’t talk about that. They talked about it four years ago, like never before, and they’ll talk about it after November 5th. They’re going to talk about the American Dream. If I win, we will bring back the American Dream bigger, better, and stronger than ever before.

Donald Trump (57:02):

So we’re pleased to be joined with a few people. You just met Mike Rogers and I wanted to have him up here separately because I will tell you, this guy is going to be a great senator. I picked him even though he wasn’t always particularly nice to me. He was paid a lot of money to say bad things about me, and that’s okay. I fully understand it. But he’s been great and he’s got great gravitas and I think he might even be leading in the poll by a little bit. He’s tough as hell and he’s good and he’s got the whole deal going. And I had a lot of choices. I had choices of people that were lovely to me, so nice. But I wanted to pick somebody that could be number one, a great senator, number two, could win, and I just want to thank you. You’ve been really working hard and I appreciate it and I appreciate Tudor Dixon very much also, the job you’ve done. And I think we have somebody here that I really have known for a long time and liked and he’s got a lot of good ideas. He’s got a lot of good ideas, especially when it comes to women’s health and health generally and the environment. I’ve got to watch him a little bit on the environment though, if you don’t mind. Health, I don’t think I’ve got to watch him much at all because he’s really good. So is Robert F. Kennedy Jr. here? Where is he? Where is he? He’s here someplace. I know he is here someplace. RFK Jr. And he’s a big part of what we’re doing and he does have great ideas. And getting a Kennedy to endorse a Trump Republican, that was a big deal, right? He’s a good man. He’s a good man and he’s doing a real job and he really does have some amazing views, to my way, especially on health of people.
(59:09)
Representatives, John Moolenaar. Where’s John? He’s around here somewhere. Hi, John. Good job you’re doing. Very good. Simple job in Congress, isn’t it, John? Great job. Bill Huizenga. Bill Huizenga. Bill, thank you, Bill. Good job. Looking good. Thank you, Bill. Great job. Jack Bergman. Jack, thank you, Jack. You got warriors. You got Warriors here. Tim Walberg. Tim, thank you. Those people are so tremendous, the way they fight in Congress for you. Some don’t. I mean, I will tell you. I could name some that won’t, but I’d get myself into a lot of trouble. I’d name some Republicans that don’t, but that group of people, they’re warriors, so you’re lucky to have them and we’re lucky to have you on my side and thank you all very much. I’ve endorsed all of them, but they’re great. Thank you very much. Real warriors.
(01:00:16)
Michigan Senate Republican leader, Aric Nesbitt. Aric, thank you Aric. Good job. How are we doing? Are you good?

Aric Nesbitt (01:00:26):

Good.

Donald Trump (01:00:26):

He said we’re winning. We got to win. By the way, we win Michigan, we win the whole thing like in 2016. But got to vote. Also, House Republican leader, Matt Hall. Matt, thank you, Matt. Good, good job. Thank you very much. Really good job. So I just want to thank them, but I want thank everybody for being here today. It’s been great. We have early absentee mail-in voting in your state, starts this week. And if you have your ballot, return it as soon as possible. And if not, get a ballot. Go out and get a ballot. Get as many Trump supporters as you can. You have a lot of people that sit back on the sides. They agree with us, they agree with everything. What’s not to agree with? We want to stop people from killing everybody. You know?
(01:01:21)
We have pretty basic policies, right? Low taxes, good education, strong border, all these different things. Common sense things. We don’t want to have… In the Olympics, I don’t know if you saw that in the Olympics, I didn’t even realize it. They have women now boxers, right? They’re boxing for women. And a young beautiful woman from Italy was boxing, a person that transitioned. I’ve got the language perfect because if I say it a little bit incorrectly, it could mean the end of my campaign. We have to be extremely careful. Like if you dare to say, gee, that’s a beautiful woman. You say it very nicely, that’s the end of your campaign. You’re out of politics. You have to be very careful. So I never see beauty anymore. I never see beauty. But you have this young woman from Italy and she’s fighting and she’s a champion fighter against women and she’s fighting in the first match of the Olympics.
(01:02:20)
And she happens to get unlucky enough to meet somebody who transitioned from male to female and got into the Olympics. Two people did. Two people were able to get in. By the way, I don’t want to upset the story, but they each won a gold medal, okay? Different weight classes. Two people transitioned from male to woman, each one won the gold medal. But this young Italian girl, she’s in there, she’s going to show her mom how good she is. She’s going to say, “I don’t care if he transitioned, Mom, I’m so tough. I can take her. I can take her.” And she gets up and she puts up her fist and he goes, for those that don’t know too much about boxing, but I love it. I love UFC. I love Dana White. Has Dana White done a great job? Dana White, what a job.
(01:03:16)
But she puts up her… And a left is sort of to keep them away. She gets hit with a left. Just a little dum. Whoa. She looks around. “Holy moly, I just got hit by a horse.” Goes back to her corner. She said… I’ve never seen this before. I’ve watched a lot of this stuff. And goes back to her corner and they say, go out there, go out there, you can do it. Go out there. Okay, I’ll go out. It’s like, what does Mike Tyson say? Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. This is what happened to this young beautiful lady. Beautiful lady. So she goes out and she gets ready to go again. Boom. He hits her again and and she quits. She said, I can’t. I’ve never been hit that hard. This was just like a little defensive punch.
(01:04:12)
He ends up going on to win the gold medal and another transitioned person won the gold medal. There were two of them, and they both won gold medals. In weightlifting. You got to see this. And for many, many years they had a certain weight that stayed the same. And they’d put an eighth of an ounce on one side, an eighth of an ounce on the barbells, right Mike? And they couldn’t quite do it. The best female weightlifter. The guy comes along, have you lifted before, they ask him or her. And he goes, not much but a little bit. And he goes up to the barbell. Boom. Bing, bing, bing, bing. And swimming. The same thing. The young lady, you saw this, she looks left and she sees all these beautiful athletes that she’s swum against for 15 years. Beautiful, beautiful swimmers. She looks to the right, she sees the same thing, but next to her is a giant. A giant. He’s got the reach of Wilt Chamberlain.
(01:05:22)
Does anybody know Wilt the Stilt? Said to have the longest reach in history. He could dunk a ball without even leaving. He’d dunk a ball like this. He wouldn’t even jump. But she looks at this guy. Giant. And she never saw this. And they say on your mark, get set, go. And she jumps. He jumps. Everybody jumps. And as you know, she was badly injured. You know what happened to her, right? I told the story before. Wind burn. He went by her so fast that she was horribly hurt. The wind, the wind burn was horrible. No men playing women’s sports. Very, very degrading to women, right? You agree, Mike?
(01:06:13)
So just to finish up, starting on day one, we will end inflation and make America affordable again. We will have no tax on tips. No tax on tips. And boy, this is good for you because I know exactly where you’d make your money. I used to have to pay that damn overtime. It would cost a fortune. No tax on overtime and no tax on social security for seniors because you’ve been devastated. You’ve been devastated by inflation, seniors. For the seniors, no tax on social security benefits. So that’s it.
(01:07:14)
By the way, I want to explain something. The people that you see leaving because nobody ever leaves. And when they do, I finish up quick, believe me, but I couldn’t take pictures at the beginning. So I take them at the end. Sometimes if I’m late, the plane gets late. You get delayed, lots of things happen. There’s a little hurricane going on in Florida, as you know. And so what they do is they say, oh, please come up now at the end of my speech. I said, don’t do that because it looks like they’re leaving like your husband who owns this place. He’s not leaving. He likes Trump very much. He made a lot of money because of Trump, right? Right?
(01:07:52)
But these stupid people that are with me sometimes. They say, come on back. 30 people, they get up and they go back and they’re all lined up in the back waiting for me to take a picture because I couldn’t do it before because I didn’t want to keep you waiting because you’re much more important than the wealthy people back there. You’re much more important to me than those people. He said, don’t do that anymore. But they don’t learn their lesson. But we are going to be late for something, but who cares? And while working Americans catch up, we’re going to put a temporary cap on credit card interest rates at 10%. Some people are paying 24%. You can’t do it. So we’re going to have a temporary cap on credit card, 10%.
(01:08:40)
I will settle the war in Ukraine. I met with President Zelenskyy today, had a good meeting. We had a great news conference afterwards. She met with him I guess yesterday. She didn’t have a news conference because she can’t do a news conference. She can’t answer any questions. She’s never going to make a settlement, believe me. And I will end the chaos in the Middle East and I will prevent World War III, something I can do that nobody else is going to be able to do. I know them all. We will rebuild our cities, including Washington DC, making them safe, clean, and beautiful again.
(01:09:17)
We will keep the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And right now with these really stupid people we have running our government, it is under tremendous threat from losing its status as the world’s reserve currency. If that happens, that’s like losing a war. In many ways, it’s worse. This is how we will end the era of inflation, mayhem, misery under Kamala and Crooked Joe and unleashed safety, prosperity, and peace for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. We’re going to do it and we’re going to do it fast.
(01:09:57)
You’re going to have businesses flowing back to Michigan. Together we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates, and low inflation so that everyone can afford the basics. It’s called a car, groceries, and a home. Right now, you can’t buy groceries, you can’t buy anything. They’re up so much. 50, 60, 70, 80%. We will stop the invasion, end migrant crime, support our police, strengthen our military. And I already rebuilt the military. They gave about $85 billion to Afghanistan, right? How about that one? In addition to losing 13 beautiful soldiers whose families I got to know and love and respect. And we left a lot of people behind.
(01:10:46)
And very importantly, we gave up a big air force base that cost us billions of dollars named Bagram, billions of dollars. One hour away. Forget Afghanistan, one hour away from where China builds its nuclear weapons. And we gave that up. These stupid people gave that up. You know who’s occupying it now? China is occupying that base. Can you believe it? We’re going to build a missile defense shield, much of it built in Michigan. We’re going to keep critical race theory and transgender insanity out of our schools and no men in women’s sports again.
(01:11:33)
We will defend the Second Amendment, restore free speech, and we will secure our elections. We are going to make our elections safe and secure. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. But for that to happen, we must defeat Comrade Kamala Harris. And we must stop her country-destroying liberal agenda once and for all. She’s beyond liberal by the way. Early absentee voting is underway, so go vote right now. You can do it right now. We want a landslide that is too big to rig, right? Too big to rig.
(01:12:23)
On November 5th, we will save our country. We will save our economy. It will go down as the most important day. November 5th, in the history of our country. We will rescue our middle class. We will reclaim our sovereignty and restore our borders. We will always put America first. We have to put America first. We will take back our country and together we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy with Bobby again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. We will make America free again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, Michigan. God bless you. God bless you. Go out and vote. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Go out and vote.

Donald Trump (02:07):

Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

Audience (02:09):

USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!

Donald Trump (02:19):

Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. And hello to Savannah, and hello, Georgia. We love Georgia. It’s great to be back in this beautiful state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. That’s what you are, American patriots. And think of this, 42 days from now, we are going to win the State of Georgia. We are going to defeat Comrade Kamala Harris, and we are going to make America great again.
(02:59)
But we’re here today to talk about how we’re going to launch a historic buildup of American manufacturing muscle and might. This is not a rally, although it feels like a rally. It’s really a little event with my five or six-thousand closest friends in the whole world. But Georgia and Savannah are going to be right in the center of the action. We’re going to rebuild our manufacturing, and it’s going to happen. It’s going to happen fast and beautifully.
(03:33)
For years, Americans have watched as our country was stripped of jobs and wealth and our companies were sold off to foreign countries. You’ve been watching, and it’s been a horror show. I’ve been watching for many years. And we had it stemmed. And then, all of a sudden, bad things happened. Bad things happened. But boy, I’ll tell you, we had it stemmed. If we would’ve had four more years, everything, this would be such a different country right now. We would’ve had no inflation. You wouldn’t have Russia attacking Ukraine. You wouldn’t have had October 7th with Israel. The Middle East is blowing up. We could be very close to World War III with these characters that don’t have any idea what they’re doing, but what a shame. And Afghanistan, what a disaster. That was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country, I believe.
(04:20)
But GE Appliances were sold to the Chinese. IBM, computers, were again sold to China under Kamala Harris. U.S. Steel is now being sold to Japan. I will stop it. We got to do it fast. We got to work fast, but we’re not going to let it happen. We’re not going to let U.S. Steel… 70 years ago, the greatest company on Earth, U.S. Steel. Now it’s going to be sold off like it was nothing. We’re not going to let that happen. We’ll build it up, we’ll make it strong, but we’re not going to. But with the vision I’m outlining today, not only will we stop our businesses from leaving for foreign lands, but under my leadership, we’re going to take other country’s jobs. Did you ever hear that expression before?

Speaker 1 (05:06):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (05:06):

Have you ever heard that we’re going to take other countries jobs? It’s never been stated before. We’re going to take their factories. And we had it really rocking four years ago. We’re going to bring thousands and thousands of businesses and trillions of dollars in wealth back to the good old USA. That’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to be doing it and doing it fast. And under my plan, American workers will no longer be worried about losing your jobs to foreign nations. Instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America. Going to bring them back. And it won’t even be difficult. Your only worry will be deciding which job to take. There will be plenty of them. That will be your biggest problem. “Darling, which company should I go with?” We’re going to bring them back, and we’re going to bring them back at levels not to be believed, but you’ll believe it in about two years from now. You’re going to say, “Wow, that happened fast.” You’re going to have so many companies wanting to come in, because this is where the money is. It won’t be if we keep running it like we have for the last four years. But this is what they want. This is what they want.
(06:21)
And you’ll hear the plan. I want German car companies to become American car companies. I want them to build their plans here. I want to beat China in electronics production, and we’ll be able to do that easily. We have the greatest genius, the greatest minds here, and then we end up building them in different places. A lot of that’s really stupid tax policy. I want GE, IBM, and every other manufacturer that left us to be filled with regret and come sprinting back to our shores. And they will. They will.
(06:57)
So, as your president, here is the deal that I will be offering to every major company and manufacturer on Earth. I will give you the lowest taxes, the lowest energy costs, the lowest regulatory burden, and free access to the best and biggest market on the planet, but only if you make your product here in America. It all goes away if you don’t make your product here and hire American workers for the job. If you don’t make your product here, then you will have to pay a tariff, a very substantial tariff when you send your product into the United States.
(07:41)
And by the way, for years, they knocked the word. The word tariff, properly used, is a beautiful word. One of the most beautiful words I’ve ever heard. It’s music to my ears. A lot of bad people didn’t like that word, but now they’re finding out I was right. And we will take in hundreds of billions of dollars into our Treasury and use that money to benefit the American citizens. And it will not cause inflation, by the way.
(08:10)
And I took in from China hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes and tariffs, and I had no inflation. We didn’t have any inflation. 1.2%. We had essentially no inflation. Now, over the last four years, you’ve had the highest inflation, I think, in the history of our… Somebody said, “No, sir, it’s only 58 years.” Well, that’s pretty bad too. I think it’s really, in the history of our country… This is the policy that built America, and this is the policy that is going to save America. It’s going to save us, because we have gone so far down in so many different ways. Not to mention the border. Not to mention 21 million people pouring in from places unknown, totally unvetted. But like I’ve always called it, because it’s a very beautiful and simple term, it’s called America first. We’re putting America first. This new American industrialism will create millions and millions of jobs, massively raise wages for American workers, and make the United States into a manufacturing powerhouse like it used to be many years ago. We will be able to build ships again. We will be able to build airplanes at a much higher level again. We will become the world leader in robotics and every other field. The US auto industry, which has been decimated over many, many decades, will once again be the envy of the planet. We’re not going to accept all of these cars. They come in from every country, and it knocks out… I was up in Michigan. We’re doing very well in Michigan. By the way, we’re doing very well in Georgia. We’re leading by quite a bit. But pretend you’re one point down, please, and go and vote. Okay?

Audience (10:17):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (10:17):

Just go vote. You got to vote. We got to win this. If we don’t win this election, our country is gone. I really believe it. To the auto workers in Michigan, Georgia, and all other parts of our country, I am pinpointing you for greatness. Your industry has been decimated by many decades of incompetent leadership, both political and at your company level. You had presidents of your company that sold out our country. They didn’t know what they were doing. They were horrible. And you had politicians that were grossly incompetent to let that happen. Your auto industry has been decimated, and again, with the electric car. It’s all going to be made in China. The head of the United Auto Workers ought to be ashamed of himself for what he’s done, but we’re going to turn it around, and we’re going to turn it around fast.
(11:09)
China is right now building major auto plants in Mexico. Did you know that? They were going to start with me. I said, “No. If you do them, I’m putting a 200% tariff on every car that you make.” And they decided, “We’ll pass.” Then they said, “Wow, now we can build. Trump, we won’t have to worry about him anymore.” Well, here I am. Here I am. Here I am. We’re leading in the polls. We’re leading by a lot. We’re leading by a lot. They said, “Oh, we don’t have to worry about him.” Oh, no, they have to worry about me. That’s why they don’t like me. They used to like Obama. They like Biden. You know why? Because they got away with murder. That’s why they like Biden. They love Biden. Why would you like Biden? Except that you took advantage of him. They took advantage of him.
(12:01)
And they think they’re going to sell their cars into the United States and destroy Michigan, and South Carolina, and North Carolina, and Georgia, and all of the places that make autos. Not going to happen. We will put a 100% tariff on every single car coming across the Mexican border and tell them the only way they’ll get rid of that tariff is if they want to build a plant right here in the United States with you people operating that plant. We want American citizens and we want their plants built here, not two feet over the border and selling them into our country. We’re not doing that. We don’t do that anymore.
(12:43)
A friend of mine does auto plants. He builds auto plants. That’s what he’s great at. He’s great, the biggest in the world. And I said, “I want to see a plant,” pretty recently ago, “I want to see a plant. Where would we go?” I said, “Would we go to Detroit, someplace in Michigan ideally?” He says, “No, you can’t go there, sir. We’ll have to go to Mexico. The big ones are being built in Mexico.” I said, “Why is that?” He said, “Well, they have a lot of tax reasons, and China’s coming in big, and they think they’re going to make their car and sell it in tax-free into the United States. But the big ones, if you want to see a really big modern plant, come with me to Mexico.” I said, “I’m not interested in going to Mexico. I want those plants built here.”
(13:24)
And that’ll happen. In fact, when they learn about the 100 or 200% tariff, they’ll probably say, “Yeah, let’s stop construction immediately.” You’ll see a big difference. I will bring automobile manufacturing back to the highest level in the history of our country. It used to be we were the only place, and then it just got chipped away, chipped away, mostly by China and Japan, and all of a sudden we were down more than 55% from where we were years ago. But it’ll be like it was 50 years ago. And these jobs, they’ll come roaring back, and we’re going to be making autos at a level that you’ve never seen before. We’ll be making cars bigger, better, more beautiful, stronger and faster than ever before.
(14:11)
Billions of people around the globe will soon be buying products proudly stamped “Made in the USA,” or if you prefer, if you have to do it, “Made in Georgia.” You can do that. And they’ll be exported through the Port of Savannah. We had a little bit to do with that deeper port under my leadership. We helped deepen the port. You know that. We helped deepen the port once, and now I understand they want to do it again. And we will get in, and we will get that done quickly. We’ll work with your governor, and we’re going to get that done very quickly. This will be a major undertaking involving the Army Corps of Engineers and transportation officials throughout your state. It’s going to happen fast. This will happen so fast you’re going to say, “Gee, I thought he just said we’re going to do it.”
(15:10)
We have a strength over environmental impact statements. Sometimes they’ll delay a project for 20 years, 25 years. With me, I think if it takes more than a month to get an approval, my people are not doing a very good job. All right? We’ll get it done very quickly. With a world-class port and a world- class workforce, this city will soon become one of the premier export hubs anywhere on Earth. Tripling and quadrupling traffic is your power. We’ll lead an American manufacturing boom. We’re going to have a manufacturing boom, and a lot of it’s just taxation policy, tariff policy. They’re going to come roaring back. When they have to pay tariffs to come in, but they have incentive to build here, they’re going to come roaring back. It’s just, it’s this. It’s not muscle. It’s all right there. That’s a muscle too, they say.
(16:04)
By contrast, listen to the deal Kamala Harris… Have you heard of her? I had the first debate, and after that, Biden was down 21 points. And they went to him and they said, “You’re going to lose. You can’t win. You’re out.” This is a coup, by the way. This guy had 14 million votes. “We’re going to put in somebody else.” The last person was going to be Kamala Harris, but then they decided to be politically correct, and she got the job. She was the last one. There were 14 people mentioned. She was number 15, and she got the job. And if you saw her with Oprah the other day, or if you saw some of these interviews, there’s something going on up there. We just had four years of that. We can’t have another four years. Not going to happen.
(16:59)
But she is offering to companies to entice them to keep jobs in America instead of shipping jobs overseas. First, listen to this, she’s called the tax queen. They love her in other countries because she forces everybody out of our country into their hands. The tax queen is demanding a 33% tax hike on all domestic production. Now, you can hate companies and all that, but still, they fuel growth and they fuel jobs. They fuel everything. You tell these companies. They don’t care. They just as soon be in Europe. They don’t care. They want to go best price, it’s called, best deal. And they’re going to leave our country in droves if she does that. It’s nice to say, “You’re going to pay 33% more.” And one day you’ll read, “Oh gee, so-and-so, they just signed with China,” “They just signed with Germany.” Great Britain is dying to have… They’ll give you free tax.
(17:53)
Next, she wants the largest capital gains tax in the history of our country. We’ve never had a tax. And then she’s telling people, “Build your place here, but we’re going to have a brand-new wealth confiscation tax. So if you make money, you’re going to pay us a lot.” But more importantly, it’s called an unrealized capital gain. You know what that is? That means that you’re going to pay a capital gain even if you haven’t realized it, even if you haven’t sold. So, a lot of people are rich, but they don’t have cash. Now, they’re going to have to get cash because if their thing goes up in value, they have to pay a massive tax. You’re going to have deterioration. You’re going to have a depression. If that happens, you have a 1929 style depression. This woman is grossly incompetent. Grossly incompetent.
(18:46)
Think of it, if a company succeeds, you have to sell it to give her half the value. Half the value is going to be owned by the government. So, if it’s successful, you’ll have to sell it because you don’t have the cash. It’s a huge success, you’re going to make a lot of money in the future. We don’t care about the future. Sell your company now, and bad things happen. By the way, nobody’s tried it. It’s a communist kind of thing. You know that?

Speaker 2 (19:13):

Oh, yeah.

Donald Trump (19:14):

You could say it’s a Marxist thing if you’d like, but communist you understand better. In addition, Kamala is shutting down power plants nationwide, causing electricity prices to soar more than 100%. Going up 100%. They will soon be totally out of control, they already are, and businesses will flee. They’re going to flee our country. If they can’t get energy, they’re going to flee our country, and they’re going to flee fast. And yet we have more energy under our feet than any other country. I call it liquid gold. Liquid gold. We have more.
(19:50)
We have more than Saudi Arabia. We have more liquid gold than Russia, and yet we’re buying oil from Venezuela. Why? And it’s not really oil, it’s tar. You have to melt it. And you know where they melt it? Talk about the environment. There’s only one plant in the world that can take care of it because it’s really not good. It’s the worst. Only one. You know where it’s located? Houston, Texas. So in Houston, Texas, they clean this stuff up. And you know where the stuff goes? Right up there. So, if you’re a big believer in the environment, this is not good. But we have the best oil on Earth, and we have the most oil, clean, beautiful stuff, and we have the most. And we’re going to use it. As I say, drill, baby, drill. That’s what we’re going to be doing. Drill, baby, drill.
(20:43)
And very importantly, she will close down all fracking and all fossil fuel development, which will bring our country into third-world status. She’s going to close down all fossil fuels. Germany tried it, but then they replaced Angela with somebody else, and that somebody else is now building a coal plant every single week in Germany. Germany was going to destroy themselves, I will say that. They were going to be out of business. They were having problems like nobody could believe. And that’s how Kamala treats the American manufacturers. They can all leave, whatever’s left of them, and there’s not that much. They’ve gotten rid of so much.
(21:21)
But if instead you ship production overseas, then she will give you a tax break. So, if you build your product, make your product overseas, she’s offering a tax break to make it overseas. Now you wonder why Biden has made so much money from all these countries, I mean personally made and through the family. Think of that. You get an incentive to build your product outside of the United States. I mean, you don’t have to be too good at business to know that’s not going to work. Honestly, it’ll destroy our country.
(21:55)
And one of the other things, even… Whatever she’s going to do, she wants to do it. She’s going to the border very soon. She hasn’t been there for four years, the border czar. “I’m not the border czar.” Oh. For years, she was the border czar. Right now she’s saying, because it’s the worst border in history… But she’s going to the border. It’s very interesting. But you know what I ask? Well, even her policies now, they’re crazy. They’re crazy. They’ll destroy country. But why didn’t they do it three and a half years ago? Now she’s saying, “We’re going to do this. We’re going to do that,” whether she’s right or wrong.
(22:26)
So, she had three and a half years to do it. She didn’t do anything. Our country has really gone back to levels… The only employment was all the bounce back jobs that we created. Millions and millions bounced back right after the pandemic. Any pandemic anywhere, you have bounce backs, and they had a bounce back. But out of all the jobs that were created, most of those jobs went to illegal migrants. You know that? It didn’t go to Americans. And what’s happening with the people pouring into our country is they are killing the jobs of the Black population and the Hispanic population. They’re taking their jobs. So, if you’re Black or Hispanic, thank you very much, vote for Trump. You’ll be in good shape. It’s crazy.
(23:18)
Those people are coming in and they’re taking the jobs of the Black population. And it makes sense. I mean, why not? And did you see Black unemployment rose incredibly in the last three months? A lot of people say, “Why is that? Why is that?” I’ll tell you why. Because people are coming in and taking their jobs. That’s the way it is. And it’s no wonder that under Kamala Harris, we lost 24,000 manufacturing jobs last month. 24,000. We’re going to turn that around so fast. We had created 650,000 manufacturing jobs before we even got ready to do it. And now we’re ready. We’re ready to do it, and the country’s ready

Donald Trump (24:00):

To do it. We need it. We have to have it. We need a Renaissance. It’s going to be a Renaissance. This horrific nightmare for American workers ends the day I take the oath of office, January 20th.

Speaker 3 (24:13):

Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump.

Donald Trump (24:31):

Thank you. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. So listen to how good it is. It’s so easy. It’s so easy. China’s used it for years, but we have a better plan than them, but they’ve used it for years. They can do whatever they want. We have to go through certain hurdles, but not much.
(24:54)
The centerpiece of my plan is for a manufacturing renaissance, which will be a 15% made in America tax rate. In other words, if you make your product in America. So the tax rate was practically close to 50%. Some people would say 38, but when you added it all up, some companies are paying much more with state and local, much more than 50%. I got it down to 21% through Congress. Can you believe we got it through Congress?
(25:28)
A lot of people say it was the greatest thing we did. I think maybe rebuilding the military was the greatest thing. Maybe the creation of Space Force was the greatest. We were being beaten badly in space and now we’re the leader in space. China and Russia were eating our lunch and now we’re eating their lunch. We did so much.
(25:53)
We gave you before the greatest, the biggest tax hikes in the history of our country and the greatest regulatory cuts in the history. Think of it. We took their tremendous tax hikes. We gave you the greatest tax cuts in the history of our country, bigger than Ronald Reagan’s tax cuts, bigger than anybody’s and the hikes, they want to do it now. They want to hike your taxes at levels that we’ve never had before. 80%, 70% was a number that she thought sounded good.
(26:25)
We gave you the biggest tax cuts in history and now we gave you the biggest regulation cuts, and that’s how we had that tremendous growth. That’s how we had the greatest job production in history. This is going to blow that away. We’re cutting the business tax now, we brought it down to 21%. So you could say it was over 50, but you could also say it was 39%. We got it down to 21%. Some of your great congresspeople are here and they are very, very instrumental in having done that.
(26:56)
Now we’re cutting the business tax from 21% to 15%, which makes us the most competitive tax anywhere in the planet, but only for those who make their product in the USA. See, that’s an incentive. So we already cut it to 21% and it was the 21% that big cut, it was the 21 plus the regulatory cuts that gave us the greatest economy in our history. It was the greatest economy in the history of our country. Now what we’re doing is taking it one step further and a bigger step, actually. We’re bringing it down to 15. Now we’re the most competitive in the world. At 21, we were pretty good. At 15, we’re the most competitive. People are going to be pouring in. Companies are going to be pouring in, and we’re going to continue with the regulatory cuts.
(27:49)
That’ll be at a level… We already beat every record for regulatory cuts. The problem is that Biden and Harris have put many of those regulatory cuts back in the books and they didn’t do anything. They were old, staid. All they did was stop business. We have US-based manufacturers will also be rewarded with expanded research and development tax credits.
(28:14)
You’ll be able to write off 100% of the cost of heavy machinery and other equipment in the first year and full expensing for new manufacturing investments. So you’re going to get full expensing. In other words, you have a one-year write-off. You buy something, you have a one-year write-off, which gives you… I did that. I did that one year.
(28:36)
We had a five-year deal. During the period you had a one-year, you had a write-off, you take it off, the business boomed. It was coming in at levels never seen before. Had we not been interrupted and make sure there’s no cheating in this election, please. What a different world we would’ve had. It all helped to build the sprawling state-of-the-art plants our country needs to be and industrial superpower in the modern world. We’re going to have companies pouring into our country under this plan. Under my plan, we will cut energy and electricity prices in half within 12 months. That means for your homes too. We will commit because of the fact that we… We’re lucky. China does not have this.
(29:27)
Can you imagine? They want to go to electric cars, our people, but we don’t have the product for electric cars. We have the product for gasoline-powered cars under our feet, and hybrids. We want to have electric cars. Hey, Elon Musk is great. He makes an excellent car, an electric car, and he endorsed me at a level that you wouldn’t believe. Every day he said, “We got to have Trump. He’s a great guy.” He understands. His product is phenomenal and there’s a great place for electric cars, but you have to have gasoline-powered cars too. You have to have hybrids, you have to have everything.
(30:16)
The new thing, and I’m sure Elon will get it if it’s any good, but you got one little problem, it explodes. Hydrogen. They say the new thing is hydrogen cars, but they’re having a problem. If it explodes, you end up about seven blocks away and you’re dead. So personally, I don’t know about you, but I’m going to take a pass. Maybe they’ll figure it out. Right now I wouldn’t recommend it.
(30:38)
There’ll be other things happening and they’ll be great. We want to have… They have the electric mandate. We’ll be ending the electric mandate, all electric cars. All electric cars. We’ll be ending that immediately. More importantly, we’ll be able to quickly double our electric capacity, which will be needed to compete with China and other countries on artificial intelligence, which is a big hot thing that’s happening now.
(31:06)
They say it’s the next big wave, I don’t know. Comes with risk, but it’s the next hot thing. It needs massive amounts of electricity. So if you took all of the electricity in our country right now, which isn’t enough because in California with Governor Newscum you have blackouts and brownouts. How about him? He wants to go all electric cars, but he can’t give you air conditioning in the summer. Let’s go all electric, but we have a blackout every 10 seconds. It’s crazy. It’s crazy.
(31:39)
We’re going to do things that nobody has ever really had the courage to do. It doesn’t take courage. It’s common sense. We’re the party of common sense. Okay? We’re conservative, all that stuff. Who cares? We are the party of common sense. We will build new power plants. Think of this, the electric. So if you took all of the electric that we have right now in our country, you need that more than doubled to be able to compete with China.
(32:07)
So they need more than double the electricity that we currently have to have, the artificial intelligence, which will be a massive field. China is already building plants, electric plants. We have a problem because we have things called environmental impact statements and various things you have to go through. I will get them approved so fast because China doesn’t really need approval.
(32:28)
President Xi says, “Okay, build that plant.” That’s the end. There’s no environmental impact statement. I would ask him, “President, do you go through an environmental impact statement?” He says, “I am the environmental impact statement.” With us you go through years and years of torture, but we’re going to do it on an expedited basis. With the lowest energy prices on earth, we will have the lowest energy prices on earth because we got lucky. We’re right on top of the best stuff in the world. I’ll put ANWR back into play. Ronald Reagan couldn’t do it. Nobody could do it. They couldn’t get it done. ANWR in Alaska, the biggest field probably in the world, maybe bigger than Saudi Arabia. I got it done. I was so proud of it. I got it done. In his first week, they terminated it. The biggest field anywhere in the world that would supply Asia, we’d make so much money, we’d pay down debt so fast and Biden rejected it.
(33:31)
When I terminated the Russian pipeline, Nord Stream 2, Biden approved it, but he terminated our pipeline, which is Nord Stream. The Nord Stream is the Russia, which is Keystone, the Keystone XL. He terminated our pipeline, but he approved the Russian pipeline, Nord Stream 2 going all over Europe, heading to Germany, but going all over Europe. I just said, “What the hell is going on?”
(33:59)
This was early on. This is in the first weeks of his administration. I said, “What’s going on?” Then they say, so think of it. I terminated the Russian pipeline, and then they said Donald Trump was very friendly with Russia. That was the biggest thing that they’ve ever done, and I terminated it.
(34:18)
When he came in, one of the first things he did is he approved the pipeline that I terminated and they say I was nice. That was the biggest… Putin told me, “If you are like this, I would hate like hell to see if you were bad. They say that you’ve been nice to me. You have not been nice to me,” with all the sanctions. We had the fake Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, which by the way, endangers our country when they do that. It turned out to be a total fake. Endangers.
(34:48)
We can’t have that from the standpoint of even business. We have to be able to get along with other nations. We have to be able to use the minerals and other things that they have. We have to make the proper deals because we can… With the proper deals, there will be nobody on earth that can compete with us in business.
(35:10)
We will attract energy hungry industries. There are a lot of industries will never be able to make it in certain areas because they don’t have energy. We have energy hungry industries that will attract them from all over the planet, meaning millions and millions of blue collar jobs and jobs of every type. To slash burdens on workers and businesses, we will cut 10 old regulations for every one new regulation. I did that for four years and we got it up to seven for one. Nobody’s ever seen.
(35:45)
I cut more regulations than any president in history in four years. We will set up special zones of federal land with ultra-low taxes and regulations for American producers. These will be ideal spots for relocating entire industries that we’ve taken in from other countries. They’re going to come in at levels that nobody’s ever seen before.
(36:16)
They want to be here. They want to be, but they were forced to be out because in this country we were so unfriendly in so many different ways, but especially with our tax policy. We will seriously expedite environmental approvals and we will get everything approved quickly to unleash mineral production and rare earth. They think we have to go to China for rare earth. We don’t. We have more rare earth than they do, but it’s protected environmentally. We can’t do anything about it.
(36:45)
We’re going to do something about it. We’re going to use our resources to our benefit. It’ll be clean and environmentally perfect so that Americans can manufacture everything that we need. The resources we have right here, American soil, it’s got everything. It’s got the rare earth, it’s got the oil, it’s got the gas. We have everything. The only thing we don’t have is smart people leading our country. Thank you very much. We’re sitting on trillions and trillions of dollars under our feet and let’s use that to make America rich again. Is that okay? We’ll pay off the debt, we’ll reduce your taxes. It’ll be a beautiful thing. You’ll never have… It’ll be a Renaissance. It’ll be a golden period. It’ll be a beautiful period.
(37:59)
Finally, to exploit these pro-manufacturing policies, their full potential is going to happen. It’s going to happen very quickly. I will appoint a manufacturing ambassador whose sole task, and it’ll be a great one, will be to go around the world and convince major manufacturers to pack up and move back to America where they want to be. They want to be.
(38:22)
For years, we watched other countries steal our jobs. Now we are going to be going after their jobs and bringing them back to America where they belong and where frankly they want to be. They want to be. If Kamala Harris gets four more years, she will de-industrialize the United States and destroy our country. We will become virtually a banana republic. We will be destroyed.
(38:52)
Their plans are horrible. If they wanted their plans, again, I say it all the time, I said it during the debate where, by the way, we absolutely destroyed her except for the fakers on a microphone. “Oh, she did very well tonight. She did very well.” She did very well? She couldn’t put two sentences together. Take a look at her answers, and it was three on one, too. ABC ought to be ashamed. It was three on one.
(39:28)
Actually, it’s also interesting because after that horrible situation, because it’s the fake news all over again, fake news. You got a lot of them back here, by the way. It’s the fake news. You know what? My numbers, look at the numbers today. The numbers are higher than they’ve ever been. We’ve never had numbers this good. So something happened that was pretty good.
(39:54)
It was interesting. I couldn’t believe, I thought she was so bad. I came off that stage. I said, “She was so bad.” One of the… He’s the goat of debates. I said, “Is that a good thing or a bad thing?” They said, “Greatest of all time,” 21 debates and I thought that was one of my best debates. After they spin, they spin better than anybody. “Well, I don’t know if I thought he did too well tonight and wasn’t she really terrific?” She didn’t say anything except lies like a bloodbath, like Charlottes Town. She lied.
(40:33)
You know what I’d say, just in finishing this topic, because they’ll say, “Oh, he fell into a trap. He talked…” When somebody says something bad about you, nobody else, this only happens to me, if I then refute them, Marjorie, if I say, “That’s not true,” and just give a few seconds and people understand it, “They say he fell into a trap.”
(40:56)
Now, if they say bad about me, I got to refute it. I do it quickly, but I refute it. As soon as I refute, “Oh, he fell into a trap.” Why would I let her say something bad about me and let it stand out there? If I don’t refute it people are going to think it’s true. These people are the worst. These people are the worst.
(41:18)
It’s been amazing what’s been happening and they’re hearing what we’re doing, policy wise, military wise, border wise. Maybe especially border. In 2016, I won on the border and we fixed the border very quickly, and I was very proud of it. After that, nobody wanted me to talk about the border. They said, “Sir, it’s been fixed.” I said, “I want to talk about the border.” They wouldn’t let me, even though we got 12 million more votes in the following in 2020, we got 12.
(41:42)
Listen, there is more enthusiasm now than there ever was for 2016 or for 2020 because of how bad they are, because of how good a job we did and how bad they are. Under Kamala there will be no car industry, no steel industry, no significant manufacturing of any kind, and we will be at risk of military defeat. You know that, right?
(42:08)
A very simple fact is this. If you don’t have steel, you don’t have a military. I’m not going to allow… I said it before and I’ll say it again, and I got along with a great gentleman, Shinzo Abe from Japan. He was assassinated. He was a great gentleman, but I said, “Shinzo, we have to change our trade deal.” He said to me, “I knew you were going to come with that.” I said, “Well, why did you know?” He said, “For 25 years, no American has said that to us.”
(42:38)
They got away with murder and we changed the deal. The deal we now have is really good, but the deal we’re going to have is going to be beyond belief, not just with Japan, with every company and every, frankly, with their companies and with their nations. I’m not going to allow Japan to buy US steel. I’m not going to let it happen.
(42:59)
70 years ago, again, the greatest company on earth. Vote for Trump, and you will see a mass exodus of manufacturing from China to Pennsylvania, from Korea to North Carolina, from Germany to right here in Georgia. They’re going to come to Georgia from Germany and lots of other places.

Speaker 3 (43:19):

USA. USA. USA. USA.

Donald Trump (43:33):

No matter where I go and I go to a lot of places, we’re definitely outworking the opposition. She’ll go to one place in three days. I say, “Why can’t I do that?” Yesterday I was in Pennsylvania. I made five stops. Five stops, three speeches. People say, “How do you do it, sir?” Then I said, “Where am I going tomorrow?” “Sir, you’re going to Savannah.” “Oh, what time are we leaving?” “8:00 in the morning.” “Oh, great.”
(43:58)
I got home. You get home at 11 12, 1 in the morning, 2 in the morning. When am I going tomorrow? I’m going to Savannah, Georgia. Well, I love you, but I wouldn’t mind leaving at 11 or 12 or 1. I’d be just as happy to be on… “Sir, we’re leaving at 9:00. We’re leaving at 8:00,” but it’s okay. It’s okay. It’s worth it.
(44:26)
Look, the way I look at it, we have no choice. If we don’t win this election, we don’t have a country anymore, so we’re going to work our asses off, going to work our asses off. We will bring back the American dream bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. It’s going to happen.
(44:40)
We’re pleased to be joined today by former Senator David Perdue, who is really working hard on the campaign. David, where is David? Where is he? Oh, see? He’s such a nice guy. He didn’t even want to stand up. He just wants to get the job done. That’s what you do. You’re a great guy, David. I appreciate it. Everyone’s telling me you’re working so hard. I said, “Where’s David?” He’s working. He’s working and he’s working on the campaign. He wants to get it done.
(45:09)
We have another great gentleman, a really fine guy, a fantastic political person, Lieutenant Governor Burt Jones. Burt, stand up, Burt. His incredible father is here. Good genetics in that family. Thank you very much. It’s a great honor to have you.
(45:28)
Representatives, and these are warriors, Buddy Carter. Buddy. Warrior, great guy.
(45:40)
A very shy, quiet person. Doesn’t like mixing it up too much, but she is really highly respected in Washington and she’s fantastic. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Of course a woman that we all love and especially we love her in Georgia, Alveda King. Thank you very much, Alveda, for being here.
(46:18)
I also want to thank Governor Kemp. He’s been fantastic. He really has been fantastic, and we’re going to get this done. I want to thank Governor Kemp for his support. Great support.
(46:29)
Starting on day one I will seal the border and stop the migrant invasion of our country. After almost four years, border czar Kamala Harris has decided for political reasons that it’s time for her to go to the border. Finally, she’s gone to the border, four years. What a disgrace that is, that she waited so long, allowing millions and millions of people to enter our country from prisons and jails, mental institutions and insane asylums and criminal cells all over the world. Not just from South America, but many of them are coming, are terrorists.
(47:04)
They’re coming from Africa. They’re coming from the Congo, large numbers from the Congo. They’re coming from the Middle East. They’re coming from Asia. They’re coming from South America, but not only South America. They’re coming from all over the world. It’s really just what they’re doing to the fabric, to the guts of our country. It’s not even believable, and you see what’s going on. You see what’s going on. They’re taking over towns and cities, and they’re taking them over with weapons. They’re taking them over with weapons that are military-quality weapons. Where the hell are they getting the weapons? She’s trying to con the public that she did a good job at the border. She’s actually saying, “No, I did a good job at the border.” Remember when she says we’re working on the border, she still has airplanes flying in loaded up with migrants over the border. She thought she wouldn’t get caught.

Donald Trump (48:00):

… it took him about two years to figure that one out. It was a little strange. Brand new, beautiful, large Boeing jets are landing in airports all over our country and migrants are getting out. It took a little while to figure that one out. So, they talk about the border, but they have planes to this day flying in, loaded up. Hundreds of thousands of people being flown into all parts of our country, destroying our country. And she’s destroyed the very fabric of our nation, allowing 21 million people to come in, at least, into our country. And think of it, totally unvetted, from places unknown. No checks, no names, no nothing, just come on in. But they do. They come from prisons and they come from mental institutions. It’s a terrible thing. And many, many terrorists. Terrorists at levels that nobody’s ever seen before.
(48:56)
During my four years, I saw the other day, they had one year where they had zero… I don’t believe it. This was done by Border Patrol. Oh, you know my all-time favorite chart in history, right? I have a chart that’s my all-time favorite, I love that. Is it around? Is it around? I love that chart. I sleep with that chart every night. I kiss it. I love it because that chart saved my life. I looked to the right, bing. If I didn’t look to the right, I wouldn’t be here with you today, I guarantee you that. And it was amazing because that chart is seldom used because I don’t like to brag, it’s seldom used. But when it is used, it’s always on my left. It’s always on my left and it’s always at the end of the speech.
(50:02)
And I do a lot of things without a teleprompter. Isn’t it nice, by the way, to have a president that doesn’t need a teleprompter? Isn’t it nice? I don’t often use a teleprompter because if you use a teleprompter, it gets very boring. If I read every single word, I could go right down and you’d be in and out of here in 35 minutes. You’d say, “That was pretty boring, wasn’t it?” Even with the good numbers that we’re putting up, that would be boring. This chart is the greatest thing ever. I said, “Let me see the chart. Bring it down.” Bing. That was a lucky one, but maybe not lucky, maybe right up there, maybe not lucky.
(50:52)
My two sons are great shooters and they said, “Dad, from 130 yards, a bad shooter couldn’t miss with that gun.” And we lost a great, as you know, a great fireman and two other people we thought we lost, but the doctors were phenomenal. The local doctors, they were sort of country doctors. They were phenomenal. They saved them. They’re okay. And the nice part, a friend of mine came up to me and said, the firefighter Corey, great guy, beautiful family, beautiful wife, daughters, he jumped on top of his daughter. So, he got hit, got hit right in the head.
(51:28)
But I don’t know if I’ve said this publicly, but a friend of mine came, a member of Mar-a-Lago came up to me. He said, “I’d like to give the family…” And this is a family with a good life and a safe community. There’s no crime, there’s no muggings, there’s no pushing people into subways. There’s no anything. It’s a nice community in Butler. And a friend of mine came up and he said, “I’d love to give the family of the firemen a check for something.” I said, “Good. I think it would be great. How much?” He said, “I don’t know.” And he handed me a check, signed it, $1 million. I said, “Wow.”
(52:10)
And when it was presented to this incredible wife of Corey, really incredible, devastated by what happened. He was a big fan. He was a big Trump guy. He had everything. They all were, all three. But the crowd was as far as the… They said 55,000 people, as far as the eye could see, and nobody left. When those bullets went off, like if it happens at a soccer game, they hear a bullet, they call it a stampede, like cattle. It’s a stampede and people are killed. Many people are killed. These bullets went off, but not one, there were a lot of them, eight, nine, and they went off. Secret Service shooter was unbelievable. The local police, actually, they did a great job in terms of the shooting.
(53:04)
He may have also hit this lunatic, but think of it. So, we gave her the check. She’s never seen anything like it. They live a very nice life, but no money, no money. And now she has a million dollars. I said, “That’s only the beginning,” because we did a GoFundMe and they raised about $6 million. So, the other two men that got hit were really hit hard. They were not going to make it. First question I ask is, “How many people were killed?” Because with so many people, no matter where a bullet goes, going to hit somebody. They said, “Three are probably dead.” Well, the two were taken immediately to the hospital. The doctors were great. I was taken to a hospital. The whole hospital was fantastic. I mean, just so professional, so good. He looked at me, he says, “You are the luckiest man.” I said, “No, maybe it’s something else,” but he couldn’t believe it.
(54:09)
The doctor said, “You know, sir, this would be a good day for you to go to the lottery and buy a nice ticket because what happened here, I’ve never said anything like that.” But look, some very good things happened. You know the nicest thing when people say it was God and God came down and he saved you because he wants you to bring America back. So many people say that. So many people say that. I hope that’s true. I hope that’s true.
(54:43)
And then, I had a little more of God’s help about two months later, you saw that, where a brilliant Secret Service agent, that’s all you could say… A lot of people when they walk down grass, beautiful flowers, very thick shrubs, everything beautiful. They could say, “Oh, what beautiful… Oh, isn’t the sky…” He wasn’t looking, this guy. This guy was no games and he was walking down the middle of that fairway and he’s looking over and what does he see? He sees a rifle, just a small part of a very big weapon, and he sees a small part of a rifle, the barrel coming out of very heavy shrubbery. Who’s going to see that? Not a lot of people. And he didn’t say, “Who’s over there, please? May we talk?” No, he took his gun and he started shooting him and the guy dropped his…
(55:52)
No, think of that. Nothing’s in the category where I have to turn to the right, you have about an eighth of a second where you’re safe. But I’m telling you God was watching there too because you needed somebody really sharp. I give Secret Service a hell of a lot of credit. Look, they’ve been hit hard because of Butler because the building should have been taken care of, and they understand that. But when I went down, I had four or five, six people right on top of me, and there were bullets flying right over our head. A lot of bullets were flying right over our head. They were not sitting back and taking a pass.
(56:33)
They were not saying, “Well, gee, I’m not going to go over. That’s dangerous stuff.” They were on top of me in seconds and you got to give them a lot of credit. But here, you have to give them credit too because this agent… I would’ve been in that location within 10 minutes and right next to the guy practically. And this guy spotted, shot. But how about this? There’s a fence in between, cyclone fence, and he then ran across the street, down the block to get his car. Only a woman could do this because men aren’t smart enough, I’ll tell you.
(57:07)
And a woman, pretty busy road, Congress it’s called, and pretty busy. But she didn’t like the way he looked. Now, I see people running all the time I don’t like the way they look, but I don’t follow them. She didn’t like the way he looked. He looked very suspicious. He was running like wild because he had to get away from the Secret Service. And his car was about a block away. She followed him, stopped right behind his car and started taking pictures of his license plate. Who would do that? Who would do that? And I asked our great sheriffs in Palm Beach, I said, “So, if this happened 1,000 times, how many times would somebody follow somebody and take pictures of the license plate?” He said, “Maybe none.” That’s right. I mean, that’s luck too and/or something. But this woman is incredible.
(58:04)
And once they had the license plate, they had him in a high-speed chase down the highway. But once they had the license plate, it was over. If they didn’t have the license plate, he would still be out there. I wouldn’t be very comfortable. I would say, “I wonder if he’s in this audience.” I’d say, “Where is this lunatic?” But this woman, what she did was amazing. So, I’ve had a very interesting experience for the last couple of months. My profession is a very dangerous one. If you think of it, it’s far more dangerous than auto racers. One-tenth of 1% of the auto racers die. One-tenth of 1% and a little more of the bull riders, that looks nasty, doesn’t it, die. Presidents, I don’t want to tell you the percentage, but it happens to be a very dangerous profession.
(58:58)
But the only thing I can say is they only go after consequential presidents, that’s true. They only go after consequential presidents. So, we are consequential. We’re going to be even more consequential because we’re going to do things that nobody has ever been able to do in this country. When Kamala is seen at the border on Friday, she will pass hundreds of miles of wall that was built by Trump and it’s wall that really works. And that’s why if you look at the arrow on the bottom, the red arrow on the bottom, the week I left office, that’s the lowest level of illegal immigration in the recorded history of our country. Look at that.
(59:47)
Oh, I love it. I just go crazy. I love it. But that’s the lowest level of illegal immigration. And that includes drugs and it includes lots of other things. Drugs are now coming through our border at about 10 times… We talk about the illegal migrants, but the drugs are pouring through. Fentanyl is pouring through. I had it down to the lowest level and I had to deal with President Xi in China that he was going to give the death penalty to anybody… That’s their penalty over there, that’s why they have no drug problem. They have the death penalty for drug dealers. He was going to put this category, those that make fentanyl and ship it to the United States was going to get the death penalty. And I told him, “If you don’t that, we’re not going to do trading with China. We’re going to go cold turkey. We’re not trading and we’re going to put tariffs on anything that gets through, big ones.”
(01:00:42)
And he agreed to do it, and then Biden of course, dropped the ball, just like he dropped the ball on Israel with Iran. Iran was ready to make a deal, they would’ve made a deal in two minutes. They had no money. They had no money. And now, they have $300 billion, they made it all in three and a half years. What a shame. What opportunity has been wasted. When Kamala speaks, be advised, and we have to tell, this woman has allowed record numbers of people into our country. They’re from all over the world. They’re now creating criminal havoc throughout the country. Aurora, Colorado, you saw that? Where Venezuelan gangs are taking over real estate, they’ve become real estate developers. How nice.
(01:01:25)
No, they’re taking over real estate and they have weapons that even our military hasn’t seen. Who’s giving them these weapons? But Aurora is a mess. The governor is a mess. The governor is a Democrat and he’s a radical-left Democrat and he’s not too popular right now because they’re going to take over a lot more than Aurora. They’re going to go through Colorado, take over the whole damn state by the time they finish. Unless I become president, they won’t last long. And in Springfield, Ohio, so you have a town of 50,000 people, they have 32,000 migrants put into the town almost overnight. And the people are so nice, they want to be nice. The mayor is actually looking for interpreters. He’s looking all over for interpreters because they can’t understand, the language is totally different. What the hell? I’m sorry. You have to move the people back to the country from which they came, you have to. You have to. Every state is a border state now. When she speaks, I hope everybody remembers that she has caused our cities, our towns, and our country itself tremendous damage. Our country is dying. Our country is dying. We’re taking all the criminals from all over the world… The crime rates for countries all over the world is way down because the citizens of their countries have demanded it. They’re taking the criminals out and they’re moving them and dumping them into the United States of America. And their crime rates are cut in half and less than that. And their jails, which were packed in many cases are close to empty, and very soon, will be totally empty because they’ve taken their prisoners and they’ve dumped them into the United States of America. We’re like a dumping ground and we’re not going to allow it. We’re bringing them back. We’re bringing them back.
(01:03:36)
And by the way, this is a speech on economic development, but this is a big part of economic development. We can’t have factories being built where you have criminals walking down the street with the worst weapons that you’ve ever seen, with machine guns and everything else. We can’t have it. We have to have a safe country because if you don’t have a safe country, everything I talk about today, you can reduce very substantially.
(01:04:03)
So, number one, we’re going to make America safe because we have to have a safe country or nobody’s going to want to come here. And with her, she doesn’t know what the word safe is. She was the head of defund the police. Anybody that heads up defund the police is not qualified to be a president of the United States. And anybody that lies like she lies… She lies about everything. She changed 15 policies. Now, I’ve watched politics for a long time. I’ve been involved on the other side for a long time with helping people out. But I’ve watched for a long time and I’ve seen people change one or two policies, but I’ve never seen people change 15 policies.
(01:04:54)
She wants to confiscate your gun. Now, she said, “Oh, I won’t do that.” She wants to have no fracking. She’s 100 times no fracking. There will be no fracking in Pennsylvania, right? No fracking. Now she’s saying, “Oh, I’d love to have fracking.” But they always go back to where they were. They always go back because that’s it, she’s a Marxist philosophy. Her father is a Marxist philosopher and he taught her well and that’s what you got and you can’t have that. Our country is not ready for this and hopefully never will be.
(01:05:29)
Remember one other thing, and I think it’s terrible, she lied about McDonald’s. She said, “I was a worker in McDonald’s and I stood over the french fries.” I’m going to a McDonald’s over the next two weeks and I’m going to stand over the french fries because I want to see what her job really wasn’t like because she never… I stood over the french fries and that was tough. It was hot outside and it was hot over… She never worked there, it was a lie. And when I asked her at the debate, I said, ” I want to talk about this,” ABC said… ABC, which is the worst of them all by the way. Did you see that David Muir’s ratings are way down? I love that bit can he lost his credibility. I love it.
(01:06:13)
Kamala’s illegals are also crushing your wages and stealing your jobs. Last month alone, think of this, American-born workers lost one-point-three million jobs and migrants gained 635,000 jobs. So, we’re putting our migrants to work at a much higher level than our own people, our own citizens. So, as we create millions of new manufacturing jobs here in Georgia, nationwide, we will make sure that these jobs go to American citizens, not illegal citizens, people that came into our country illegally. Your wages will rise. Your costs will fall. Your job opportunities will grow because we will conduct the largest deportation operation, sadly, in American history. We have no choice. This is not sustainable.
(01:07:05)
And we got to get the criminals out first. We’re going to get the criminals, the murderers, the drug dealers. We’re going to get them out of here first. And we’re going to work with local police. They know everything about them. They know their names, they know their serial numbers. They know everything. Our local police are phenomenal, we just have to let them do their job. And starting on day one, we will end inflation and make America affordable again. We will have, ready, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime. And for our seniors who have been devastated by this Harris-Biden inflation that was so unnecessary caused by energy, they let energy go through the roof, it caused it and also their spending, but I say even more by energy. We are going to have this for our seniors. No tax on social security. They deserve it. They deserve it.
(01:08:18)
What they’ve had to put up with the people, with the tips, they’re being tormented by this administration too. They passed new legislation and have other legislation that was ready to go. All of a sudden… How about her? She comes out months after I did, “There will be no tariffs on tips,” but that’s it. Nothing ever happened. Nothing ever happens with her because if it did happen, she would’ve done it three and a half years ago. That’s what I say.
(01:08:47)
And to finish, she lied about McDonald’s. She lied and she lied about almost everything else. And she doesn’t understand a question and she can’t give an answer. If you watch Oprah, I knew Oprah very well. She loved me before politics. She was down at Mar-a-Lago, “Donald, this is the most beautiful place I’ve ever seen. Can we have the funeral of Roger King…” He was King World. Great guy. Great guy. “Could we have the funeral at Mar-a-Lago?” “Yes, Oprah. You can.” We had his funeral. He is the most important guy and one of the most important people in her life. She was the one that worked it out, but she was there a lot. She loved the key lime pie. I love that key lime pie.
(01:09:27)
But once I ran for politics, it’s like, ” I don’t like that guy very much.” No, I gave up a lot, but I don’t mind giving it up because we’re going to make our country greater than ever before. And while working Americans catch up, we’re going to put a temporary cap on credit card interest rates at 10%, we have no choice. They’re getting 22%, 25%. We can’t let people have to pay 25% and 22% interest because they can’t afford to pay off their credit card. We’re going to cap it for a period of time at 10%. We will terminate the Green New Scam and spend the trillions and trillions of dollars of unspent dollars on roads, bridges, real infrastructure and paying down debt, not fake infrastructure that has caused massive inflation, along with the energy.
(01:10:21)
That bill was just a disaster. Just trillions of dollars. That’s what caused all of the inflation, those two things. I will settle the war in Ukraine and I will end the chaos in the Middle East and I will prevent something that nobody else will be able to do. I will prevent World War Three, and you are very close to World War Three. Biden and Kamala got us into this war in Ukraine, and now they can’t get us out. They can’t get us out. I watched him. “We will win. We will…” He’s been saying that for three years. Every time Zelenskyy comes to the United States, he walks away with $100 billion. I think he’s the greatest salesman on Earth. But we’re stuck in that war unless I’m president. I’ll get it done. I’ll get it negotiated. I’ll get out. We got to get out.
(01:11:13)
Biden says, “We will not leave until we win.” What happens if they win? That’s what they do is they fight wars. As somebody told me the other day, they beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon. That’s what they do, they fight and it’s not pleasant. But we’ve given them close to $300 billion. And you know what Europe has given them? Which is approximately our size when you add up the countries together, their economy, it’s very close to our size. They’ve given them a small fraction of that number. Just a very small fraction and we have an ocean separating. It’s much more important for… Now, why aren’t they? You know why they are? Because Biden has never even asked them, I guarantee you. Do you think Biden lies awake at night thinking, “How are we going to get Europe to pay?”

Donald Trump (01:12:00):

… you know, he goes to sleep. Here’s a guy can sleep on the beach. How do you sleep on the beach when you have cameras on? I will never sleep on the beach in front of live television. I promise. No, the other day he was out cold. I said, “Is he sleeping?” I don’t know. I don’t know. Maybe it’s a great thing if you’re able to sleep with live television going. Somebody told him he looks great in a bathing suit. You know when you’re 82, it’s never too pretty. And I love 82-year-olds, but when you’re 82 in a bathing suit, I don’t know, you know?
(01:12:40)
But he actually, he was stone-cold out. You got to give him credit though, because anybody that can do that … I find it very hard to sleep. I get so many ideas. I’m thinking all the time. This guy just goes out. Lies down, goes out. Pictures of him. It’s pretty sad when you think about, right? We laugh, but it’s sad. And nobody told us he was cognitively impaired. She didn’t say it. She didn’t say it. And that puts our country at great danger because President Xi is at the top of his game. All of these guys that we’re competing against are all at the top of their game. He’s not. He hasn’t been for a long time. And that puts us at great risk and great danger. We will rebuild our cities, including Washington DC, making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. And we will keep the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency, because it’s under tremendous [inaudible 01:13:50] right now. And if we lose that, then we are indeed a third-world country. We cannot allow that to happen. We have so many enemies now. We have so many people. I had no wars, other than ISIS, which I inherited, and I finished off ISIS in four weeks instead of five years that they thought, because we have a great military that I rebuilt. I rebuilt our military. Sadly, $85 billion of it went to Afghanistan. Can you believe that? Should have never happened.
(01:14:19)
You take the soldiers out last. You don’t take the soldiers out first. Took the soldiers out. And then, after they took the soldiers out, the Taliban had a field day. What a horrible thing. We lost 13 great soldiers, many wounded so horribly. The legs, the arms, the face obliterated so badly. Nobody ever talks about them. They talk about those that were killed. And I love those families. I know the families. They’ve never even called the families, but they were 13 killed. Great people.
(01:14:50)
But we also left behind billions and billions of dollars worth of the best military equipment in the world. And now Afghanistan one of the largest sellers of military equipment. 777,000 rifles and guns. 71,000 vehicles, many of them armor-plated. But you have to see goggles and planes and tanks. The stupidity of these people. We have to get back to a country again. We have to be respected. They laugh at us. All over the world they’re laughing at us. And you know what? They’re really laughing at? Kamala, because they can’t believe that she’s going to be president. They can’t believe.
(01:15:33)
You talk about cognitive problems. She’s got bigger cognitive problems than he has, in my opinion. This is how we’re going to end the era of inflation and mayhem, misery. Under Kamala and crooked Joe, we had such misery. Think about what we’ve been through with the inflation, with the wars all over the world. Prime minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban, strong man, really a great leader, didn’t allow anybody into his country. He said, “No, I don’t want people blowing up our shopping centers. I don’t want people killing our people.” But he said when he was asked recently, a couple of times just recently, he said it numerous times, they said, “Why is the world blowing up? The Middle East is blowing up. Russia looks like it’s going to end up in a World War Three. All of these problems are happening. They weren’t here.” He said, “It’s one simple reason, Donald Trump isn’t president. You make Donald Trump president of the United States. Nobody understood him. Everybody was afraid of him. They feared Donald Trump.”
(01:16:38)
He said it. I didn’t say it. Because it sounds sort of … But he said it. He said, “China feared him. Russia feared him. They all feared him. We had no problems.” Russia was never going into Ukraine. And they didn’t for four years, they didn’t. When I left, they just went in. It was the apple of his eye. I know him very well, had a good relationship with him, especially since the hoax created by Hillary and shifty Adam Schiff and all these people, these low lives.
(01:17:09)
By the way, you know the danger that that kind of stuff causes our country? Tremendous risk. I mean, fortunately it worked out fine, but there’s tremendous risk when you start doing that crap, all made up stuff, made up stories of fantasy land. We will unleash safety, prosperity, and peace for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. We’re going to have prosperity the likes of which this country has never had.
(01:17:41)
And together we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, really low energy costs. Forget about companies, it’s going to happen for them too, same thing. We’re going to get your energy bills reduced by more than 50% within the first 12 months of my administration. And I’m talking now, house owners and renters and everybody, your car, everything’s going to go way down. And that’s going to lead a wave of bringing some of these horrible prices down because interest rates are now, think of it, 10%, we had them at 2%. But low interest rates, low inflation. You’re going to have all of this. You’re going to get really low interest rates again, because when the energy goes down, the interest rates are going down too. It’s honestly not that complicated. Not easy to do, but I know how to do it. And I did it once and it was incredible.
(01:18:43)
Just go back and compare your prices with what you’re paying for things today, with what you were paying four or five years ago. You won’t even believe the difference. I want to make sure that everybody can afford groceries, a car, and a home. The basics. I want to make sure that our young people can experience the potential at least of the American dream. We will stop the invasion. We will end migrant crime. We’re going to support our great police. We’re not going to be defunding our police. She’ll go back to defunding the police.
(01:19:26)
Do you know? I have the support of virtually every major police group in the United States. I just got the support from the Fraternal Order the other day. 400,000 police. I don’t think she has one. Because she’s horrible on crime and she’s going to be horrible on crime. She’s horrible on the border. She’s horrible on business. She’s bad on everything. Other than that, she’s just fine. What a mess our country’s in.
(01:19:58)
Somebody said the other day, “If she won, you literally may never have another election. This could be your last election.” And I used to say it about Venezuela, remember years ago I’d say, “Venezuela better be careful.” And I’ll tell you what, we better be careful because we’ll end up being Venezuela on steroids. That’s where we’re headed. If this communist gets in to be president, if she’s the president of our country, we’re going to have problems the likes of which this country has never had. And once you have those problems, it never comes back. You don’t see them coming back. They never come back.
(01:20:36)
We’re going to strengthen our military. I rebuilt our military, but now we have to strengthen it again. We’re going to build a missile defense shield around our country. We need that protection, just like Israel has and just like some others have. And it’s going to be made largely right here in the great state of Georgia. You do a lot of that. We want to have a shield and we deserve a shield. And you have some lunatics out there that are not loving us too much and we’re not going to let it happen. We’re going to build a shield. It’s going to be all made in the USA.
(01:21:10)
You know when we build an airplane, and I changed a lot of it, some of those planes are made with parts from 21 different countries. Did you ever hear of anything so stupid? So, in a war, we have a war, we won’t be able to get a part from various … We can’t build the planes. And the steel too. We need steel for our ships. We have to build great ships. We can’t say to China, “Listen, we’re in a war.” I won’t say with them because I don’t want to give you any ideas, “We are in a war. We need some steel. Can you send it to us?” “No, we’re not going to send you any steel.” What are we going to do? We have to have our steel. We have to have our steel plants. There are some things we cannot let others do.
(01:21:50)
We’re going to keep critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our school. And we are going to keep men out of women’s sports. We will defend the Second Amendment, restore free speech, and we will secure our elections. They’re going to be so secure. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. But for that to happen, we must defeat Comrade Kamala Harris and we must stop her country destroying … This is a country-destroying, liberal agenda that we have to stop once and for all. We have to stop it. We cannot let this continue.
(01:22:49)
So, get everyone you know, get out and vote. We want a landslide that’s too big to rig. Too big to rig. At a certain point they can’t cheat. When it’s too big to rig. You know what that means? Pretty obvious. But we want to make it so it doesn’t matter. Too big to rig. And I think we’re getting close to that in Georgia right now, with a lot of great help. A lot of great help. On November 5th, we will save our economy. It will go down as the most important day in the history of our country, far beyond our economy, because we’re going to save our country. It will be the most important day, November 5th, in the history of our country. We will rescue our middle class. We will reclaim our sovereignty and restore our borders. We will put America first and we will take back our country. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

Thank you very much, Pennsylvania. Thank you. Thank you. It’s great to be back in this beautiful commonwealth with thousands of proud, hard-working American patriots. That’s what you are. That’s what you are. And when I look at this crowd and I look at the crowd outside, and we stopped a couple of places and nobody’s ever seen anything like it, let me tell you, they have us up in the polls, as you know, in Pennsylvania. And all over the place, actually. But when they say we are three points up or four, there’s no way. It’s got to be a hell of a lot more than that. It has to be. It has to be. Polls are fake also just like these people, the fake news. They just… We prove that. We prove that a lot. Well, I just want to thank you. We are here today because early voting begins in Pennsylvania over the next two weeks and we need each and every one of you to go out. Just don’t take anything for granted. We have to win Pennsylvania. Go out and make a plan to vote early, vote absentee or vote in person on election day, but you got to get out and vote. You got to say to your husband, “Harry, get the hell off that couch.” We can’t take any chances because our nation is at stake. Our nation is going to hell. What they’ve done to our country at the border with inflation, with that Afghanistan nightmare, that was the most embarrassing day probably in the history of our country, the way they did that.
(04:01)
Getting out was fine, but you get out with dignity and strength. What they did was so bad. When you look at October 7th in Israel, it would’ve never happened. And you look at the Russian attack of Ukraine, would’ve never, ever happened. Not even a thought of it. Think of it. Think of how different this world would’ve been. Think of how different this country would’ve been. Our country, which is just going so bad, it’s so bad. Millions and millions of people are pouring into our country and they come from jails. They come from mental institutions and insane asylums. They’re terrorists at a level, they’re terrorists at a level that nobody’s ever seen before and they let them come in and you have the border czar, this person that can’t even speak, she can’t ask a question, she can’t answer a question from…
(04:53)
Now she gets out. Oprah Winfrey, who I used to know well, she used to love me until I decided to run for politics. ” Oh, let’s go to Mar-a-Lago, Donald. I love the place so much.” No, she used to love me, but once I ran for politics, that was the end of that and that was okay with me. I couldn’t care less because we got to make our country great again. We got to make it great again. Greater than ever before. But Oprah would ask just a simple question and you get this crazy answer or you don’t get any answer. Just, this is not a president. We had four years of this. We’re not going to have four more years. We won’t survive it. I also want you to promise to find at least one voter and get them out to the polls. Find these people.
(05:39)
There’s so many people. If everybody votes… It’s interesting. Christians, we got to get the Christians to vote. I don’t know what it is. Relatively, they don’t vote a lot. They go to church and they love church and that’s great, but we got to get Christians, Evangelicals. We have to get them out to vote. We have to get gun owners. Gun owners don’t vote. They don’t vote. We have to get them out. The NRA gave me their total endorsement. They have every time total, complete endorsement, but they vote at levels that are very low. You know what it is? It’s probably rebellion. They’re rebelling. But there’s nothing to rebel about. You have to get out. If we had Christians voting in full strength, we couldn’t lose. If we had the gun owners voting at full strength, we couldn’t lose. We have to get gun owners because your guns are under siege. She wants to take your guns away.
(06:40)
Our entire nation is counting on the people of this great commonwealth and I know you will not let us down. You’re not going to let us down. We got to get out and vote. And you can start right away. You know that, right? Now we have this stupid stuff where you can vote 45 days early. I wonder what the hell happens during that 45. Let’s move, see these votes? We’ve got about a million votes in there. Let’s move them. We’re fixing the air conditioner in the room, right? No, it’s terrible. What happened the last time was disgraceful, including right here. But we’re not going to let it happen again. You know too big to rig, right? That’s one way you do it. Can’t let it happen. We got to take our country back from these horrible people because if we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing. It’s very simple, right? 43 days from now, 43 days. We’ve been waiting for four years. Four years. We had people that were so incompetent. They were the most incompetent leaders in the whole world, and she is worse than Sleepy Joe Biden. She’s worse. She’s worse. 43 days from now, we’re going to win Pennsylvania and take our country back and we’re going to be so happy. And it’ll be the most important day and the most important vote in the history of our country because we’re losing our country. Somebody I heard the other day, pretty smart person, and you think about it, and it could be true, they said, “If we don’t win this election, there may never be another election in this country.” It could happen. Look at Venezuela. Venezuela was the most prosperous country and now you take a look. And can you believe these stupid people are buying oil from Venezuela?
(08:39)
From Venezuela. Who was our enemy. They foreclosed on his airplane, a crappy old airplane, but they’re giving him billions of dollars for oil. It’s not oil. It’s tar. It’s the worst. And for the environmentalists, you know where they cure the tar? Where they take the tar and they make it into beautiful oil? Used in Texas and it all goes flying up in the air. You ought look into that one, for all of you wonderful people that talk about the environment, like I do, like I do. Like many of the people in this room do. But they do it, the oil refinery is in, it’s the only one that can do it because it literally is tar. It’s not good stuff. We have the best stuff and we have most. We have more liquid gold under our feet and we’re buying oil from Venezuela. We don’t need it at all. It’s crazy. These people are crazy. What a nice looking man. Who is that? Oh, that’s Trump. What a wonderful looking person. I’m just checking out the hairstyle as I’m talking. I don’t know.
(09:39)
No, I’m talking and I’m looking up. I’m saying I don’t love it. Yeah. [inaudible 00:10:00]. What the hell can you do? There’s nothing I can do about it, right? We’re stuck with it. Kamala Harris is reportedly giving a speech in Pittsburgh. Her speeches are very short, about her plan to quote build wealth. She doesn’t know anything about building wealth. But she’s been in office for three and a half years. She’s saying what she’s going to do if she becomes president, but she’s been there almost four years. She hasn’t done anything except destroy our country with millions of people that shouldn’t be here. And inflation. And inflation. What the damage that Sleepy Joe… I’m tending to call him Sleepy Joe lately because… I called him Crooked Joe, but now he’s not, who’s our president? We don’t even have… Do we have a president?
(10:58)
Why doesn’t he leave? Why doesn’t he leave? No, think of it. Think of it. I called him Crooked Joe. That was very effective. It got him out of the race. [inaudible 00:11:08]. No, we had a debate and he didn’t do too well in that debate and they came to him and they said, “You’re down 21 points and you’re going to lose.” This can only happen to me, so I end up with somebody new. But here’s the thing, all I have to do is expose her for what she is. She’s a communist, okay? She’s a communist and this country is not ready for a communist and hopefully never will be because that doesn’t work. Kamala talks about all these things that she’s going to do, but she’s been here… Think of it. She’s been here for almost four years and she’s not done anything.
(11:46)
“I will do this. I will do that. I will do this.” What the hell? She could do them today. They talk about the border. “Oh, we have a plan for the border.” I didn’t have any help. I had a very hostile Congress and what I did is I said, “Close the border,” to the border patrol. They’re great. And the border was closed. We had the safest border in the history of our country. We had, and that border was a mess. In 2016, I think I won maybe because of the border. The border was very bad. And in 2020 I couldn’t talk about the border because there was no problem. My people, my geniuses back there, they all said, “Sir, you can’t really talk about the border. There’s no problem.” I said, “Well, I want to at least talk about it how I fixed it.” They said, “People don’t care, sir. They don’t care.” So I didn’t talk about the border, but we did get millions of more votes. If you remember 2020, we got millions more votes. Millions. Look at that guy with a rug on over there. Look at him. Look at that handsome guy.
(12:49)
You look good. He looks good. But we got millions more votes. But I’ll tell you what. And we’ve been all over Pennsylvania today. 2016 or 2020, we never had the enthusiasm that we have right now. Look at this. Look at this. And the reason is because they’re so bad. We never had anything to compare it to. They’re so bad. Four years of destroying our country. We don’t have a great country anymore. Remember I had KAG, Keep America Great, but I couldn’t use it because I said, “America’s not great.” I hate to say it. But America soon will be greater than ever before. You watch. We got to win the election. We got to win the election.
(13:40)
And I can’t call her Harris either. You know Harris. When I say Harris, nobody knows… Does that make sense? I say, “And when Harris,” everyone says, “Who’s Harris?” Nobody knows this person. No, they don’t know her by the name Harris. They know her Kamala. It’s strange. The name Harris. And when Harris, and people say, “Who is that Harris?” Nobody knows who the hell I’m talking about. Do you know that? Lee, nobody knows. You’re a good lawyer. Maybe we have to change your name. But nobody knows… A nice name, Harris. I know some people named Harris. They’re nice people. She happens to be not a nice person. She happens to be person that’s destroyed everything she’s ever touched. Kamala’s ruinous economic policies have already cost the typical household $29,000 through rampant inflation. $29,000 per household.
(14:38)
She’s a one-woman economic wrecking ball. And if she gets four more years, her radical agenda will smash the economy into rubble and grind your financial situation right into the dust. You can’t have it. You can’t have it. We’ve had it. We’ve had it. The guy is incompetent and she’s incompetent also. She had the other interview with the other guy, who was a nice guy, I think, from Philadelphia, from Pennsylvania, and he was a nice guy who was asking her all these… They don’t only take, they don’t take like I do. Anybody wants to go, go. What the hell difference does it make? And how dishonest was ABC? It was three on one.
(15:22)
How about this David Muir and the other woman I never heard of? I don’t know. How the hell did she get there? I never heard of her. But David Muir, when I say crime numbers are rising, he interrupts me, kept interrupting, and he said, “We have it by fact that crime numbers are going down.” I said, “Anybody that thinks crime is going down is a serious brain problem.” And then it got announced the following day that Trump was right, that crime was up 45%. How about them? And I thought she was terrible at the debate. She didn’t answer any questions. All she did is tell lies. Bloodbath. She talked about Charlottesville. All these things were all, I hate the word debunked, but it says it. They were all debunked, every one of them. And people said it. Well, the radical left didn’t say it, but they’ve all been fully debunked.
(16:21)
All she did was tell lies. But when it came time to ask a question like, “What are you going to do about inflation? What are you going to do about keeping taxes low?” She was unable to even talk. But the one on Oprah was the worst one in my opinion. Oprah wanted to climb under the table it was so embarrassing. She couldn’t answer the simplest question. So vote Trump and your incomes will soar. Your net worth will skyrocket. Your energy costs and grocery prices will come tumbling down and we will bring back the American dream bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. The American dream. We don’t talk about the American dream anymore. You know that? Mr. Congressman, what a great congressman. I’m going to introduce you guys. But what a good warrior you are. Thank you. We don’t talk about the American dream, right? Anymore. We used to talk about it all the time. Today, they don’t talk about it. Don’t lose hope. We have to have hope. Don’t lose hope. Our country’s an embarrassment. The whole world is laughing at us. We’re going to be stronger. They weren’t laughing at us four years ago. They were not unhappy to see me head off. And they said, Thank goodness. We’ll never have to see him or deal with him again.” China had to pay $472 billion in tariffs. No other president took in 10 cents from China. Not 10 cents. No President took in 10 cents. And remember this. And I just say this. If you look at Ukraine and Russia, but they say Russia, I stopped the Russian pipeline. It’s called Nord Stream 2. Nobody ever heard of it until I came along. I stopped the biggest economic development job, the biggest job they’ve ever done, I stopped it cold. When Biden came in, he let them build, but he killed our Keystone pipeline, which we needed. He killed Keystone. So he killed. But think of it. And remember this about Russia under Bush. They took a lot under Biden and Barack Hussein Obama. Has anyone ever heard of him?
(18:36)
Barack. Barack Hussein. A lot of people say he’s actually running the country right now. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. But some people say he’s running our country under… I don’t think it’s Biden. I can tell you. Under Barack Hussein Obama, they took a lot, right? Under Biden, they’re taking everything. They’re taking everything. This is Russia. They’re taking everything. Ukraine is destroyed. It’s destroyed. They could have made a deal and you didn’t even have to make a deal. Putin was never going if I were president. But even if you did, you could have made a deal, now the whole place is destroyed. The cities are knocked down. Millions of people are dead. Far more people are dead than anybody knows. Far more people. When you see those cities get knocked down and they say two people are injured, it’s all a lot of fake news. I’ll tell you. The people are dead. Millions of people. And now the whole place, the whole place has been, the cities have been knocked down. The whole place. They could have made a deal three years ago and everything would be happy, vibrant. Their heritage wouldn’t have been broken. Those beautiful golden towers are taken down. All of those beautiful ancient towers are rubble on the ground now. Any deal they make, what’s the deal? They have to go back. They’ll take a hundred years to rebuild, and you can never rebuild it like it was. That should have never happened. It would’ve never happened if I was president. And you know what? It didn’t happen. And even radical-left lunatic Democrats say, “I will say, if Trump was president, it wouldn’t have happened. Putin would’ve never done it.” I said, “Don’t do it, Vladimir. Don’t even think. We’re not going to do it, Vladimir.”
(20:19)
Said, “Vladimir, we’re not going to do that, Vladimir.” And China, I had the same, almost identical conversation with President Xi of China. “Don’t go in. Don’t go in.” He’s got planes circling Taiwan. They’re circling. He wants that so badly. And Vladimir wanted it badly. That was the apple of his eye. Ukraine was the apple of his eye. But I said, “Don’t do it.” He would’ve never gone in. Would’ve never happened. All these things would’ve never happened. But Ukraine, now, I see Zelensky is here. I think Zelensky is the greatest salesman in history. Every time he comes into the country, he walks away with $60 billion. Billion. Walks in with $60 billion. He wants them to win this election so badly. But I would do differently. I will work out peace before I’m even, before… As President-elect, if I win this election, the first thing I’m going to do is call up Zelensky and call up President Putin. And I’m going to say, “You got to make a deal. This is crazy. Crazy.” They asked Biden, “When was the last time you spoke to Putin?” He didn’t know. Of course he didn’t know. What a stupid question. Of course he doesn’t know. How would he know a thing like that? But it’s been years. Years. And they keep bombing, bombing, bombing, cities pouring down, bombing, bombing. It’s horrible, horrible. Naturally, they’re reduced now to using young boys and old men, young boys and old men because their people have been killed. So many of their people have been killed that they are using young boys to fight the war, and old men. How about that? What a horrible thing has happened just because… And it’s our fault because it’s a war that should have never been allowed to happen, and we had the power that it would never have happened. We have an incompetent leader in Biden, and we have somebody who’s worse in this new one that they threw into the ring. Central to Kamala’s agenda for economic destruction is her plan to impose the largest individual tax hikes in American history onto our public, the largest small business tax hike in history, the largest capital gains tax hike in history. How about the capital gains tax, right? How about that one?
(22:47)
And even the brand new wealth confiscation tax or unrealized capital gain. How about that? Unrealized. I know a lot of people that are rich, but they have no cash. They’re rich as hell. But what are they going to do? They have to pay cash to… Unrealized. In other words, you pay a capital gains tax even though you’re not selling your property, your stock or whatever it might be. It’s never, I don’t think it’s ever even been done. It’s been thought of by communist nations, but I don’t think it’s ever been done. You know, her father is a fascist. He’s a Marxist and he’s a teacher of Marxist economics. What the hell are we doing? What are we doing? Where have we come? Which will annihilate, if they do that unrealized capital gain, which I can’t believe they can pull it off, but if they do it, it’ll annihilate stock market and wipe out the savings of millions of seniors and middle-class families. It’ll wipe out our country. Our country will be driven… And I think, anyway, it’ll happen. A lot of people say the only reason the stock market’s high is everyone thinks I’m going to win the election. I believe that’s true. A lot of the biggest, smartest… Uncle Sam. Look, it’s Uncle Sam. Uncle Sam is here.
(24:13)
Do you agree with that? Uncle Sam says that. No, A lot of people agree. I think it’s going to be horrible if we don’t win for. So many other reasons too. But you’ll have a depression like 1929. Kamala Harris is the tax queen and she’s coming for your money. She’s coming for your pensions and she’s coming for your savings unless you defeat her in November. And they want to take away your guns. Remember that. Always remember that. As President, I will keep Kamala’s greedy hands out of your pockets and we will deliver gigantic tax cuts. I gave you the largest tax cuts in history and we are going to go further.
(24:52)
That’s what created the greatest economy. When they say compare yourself now, but do something else. Compare costs. Now compare the cost of bacon with the cost of bacon four or five years ago. Compare the cost of just groceries. Some of these things have gone up four, five, six times. Energy, interest rates. How about, I was at 2% interest rates. Now they’re at 10%. But you can’t get the money, so you got to keep going up. Okay. You’re not at 10% if you can’t get the money. We will have… I’m very proud of this. And then she copied me on one of them. Only one. I’m waiting for the others. We will have no tax on tips.
(25:40)
That was an easy one. We will have no tax on overtime. We work overtime. And for our seniors who have been decimated, decimated by the stupidity of inflation, these people, what they did to you on inflation, we will have no tax on social security benefits. No tax. You’ve been decimated. They took it all away. They took it all away from you. And for all the suburban households paying high property taxes here in Pennsylvania, I will restore the SALT deduction. Do you know what that is? SALT deduction? You will. To save you thousands of dollars. Maybe I shouldn’t bother with… That’s a good one. But you guys don’t know what the hell it is. That’s a good one. People think of New York, but it actually affects you very much too. I think I’ll keep it off of Pennsylvania. You don’t care. You didn’t like that one so much, but it’s actually pretty good. It’s no wonder that Kamala Harris was just officially endorsed by IRS agents. Do you believe it? That’s one you’d say, “I’d rather not have that endorsement.” But I’ve been endorsed by virtually every police group in the entire nation. Every police group. Almost every sheriff’s group, every police group, every one of them. We just had won the Fraternal Order. We just had 400,000 policemen. That’s the biggest of all the unions. And they endorsed me.
(27:32)
And this is the first time in decades just got endorsed by the rank and file members of the Teamsters, which I happen to think is amazing. That was a surprise. That’s automatic for the Democrats. And now the bosses didn’t endorse me, but they had a problem. They got 30% of the vote. We got actually 60% or 61% of the vote. Can you believe it? So the people that were in the 61%, the people that want us, they said, “Well, how come you didn’t endorse them? Why do you…” They’re just going to take a pass, but maybe that’s okay. That’s all right. We know where they stand and that’s good. Kamala Harris is the candidate of the tax collectors and the Washington Bureaucrats. I am the candidate of the American worker, and I always will be. I always will be. But perhaps Kamala’s biggest tax hike of all is her vicious attack on Pennsylvania energy. You are under attack. If anybody here believes that she will let your energy industry continue, like fracking, you should immediately go to a psychiatrist and have your head examined. On dozens of occasions, Kamala said that she intends to ban fracking. “I’m going to ban it. I’m going to ban it.” I think we have a clip. Would you like to see a clip? I spend a lot of money on these clips. Spend a lot of money on these clips.

Kamala Harris (29:10):

That’s why I’m committed to passing a Green New Deal, creating clean jobs, and finally putting an end to fracking once and for all.

Speaker 1 (29:22):

Mamala Kamala just don’t give a frack.

Donald Trump (29:26):

Isn’t that great? He’s not very funny. Can you… That guy, those three guys, they’re being blown away by Gutfeld. You know Gutfeld totally dominant [inaudible 00:29:37]. You remember that guy? When I first ran, it was 2015 thinking about running. I was going to run. I went on his show, right? And he goes, “The Tonight Show, which is dying. They’re all dying.” Where is Johnny Carson? Bring back Johnny. It made you appreciate, right, Uncle Sam? It made you appreciate the greatness of Johnny Carson and these guys. These three guys, they’re so bad. All three of them. All three of them. But this one, I go on his show and he goes, “Is that your real hair?” I said, “Yeah.” He said, “Do you mind if I mess it up?” I said, “I’d prefer no.” Do you remember this?

Crowd (30:16):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (30:18):

I said, “I’d prefer it if you didn’t, to be honest, but if you have to.” So he grabs it and he starts really going crazy, right? And everybody laughed and it was a big thing. And it was a big hit. It was all over the place. And he got great ratings and all. And six months later, he went out because he was under pressure to apologize because he humanized Donald Trump. Do you remember? And he stood up and he said, “I’d like to apologize. Six months ago,” or whatever it was, “I messed up Donald Trump’s hair and it humanized him and he became president. And I would like to apologize.” How weak and pathetic is a guy like that? And his show died. But the other two shows are dying. The one on ABC is dying. He was the worst host in the history of the Academy Awards. Remember I did that? Remember I wrote a, I put a Truth. Everybody should go to Truth immediately.
(31:16)
And by the way, we also love Elon. I have to tell you. [inaudible 00:31:21]. Gave me a big endorsement. Big one. But remember in the Academy Awards, I said how he’s the worst host in the history of the Academy Awards. And this stupid guy goes up and just before the best picture of the year, the show is almost over. They’re waiting for the best picture of the year. He gets up and he says, and his wife said, “Please don’t do it. Please, darling. Don’t go out.” His manager said, “Don’t do it.” “I have to do it.” He goes out and reads my Truth to the entire audience right before the best, prime time, the best picture. And it said basically, “He is the worst host of the history…” He reads the whole thing. And then I think he

Donald Trump (32:00):

He said something like, “Ha, ha, ha. He thinks he bothers me,” or some crap like that. I said, “He’s one of the dumbest human beings ever. He should have listened to his wife.” What a dope. But all three of them are bad. The hatred. It’s supposed to be comedy. It’s hatred. It’s like terrible, but they’re dying. And did anyone see the Gutfeld for last week?

Crowd (32:22):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (32:26):

Actually, I said it in the show, so Gutfeld had the highest ratings in his history, and it was the number one show of the week on all of television, not just on cable, on all of television. It beat all the network shows. But I told it on the show. Gutfeld hated me, for a long time hated me. Then he started saying, “I’m starting to…” He didn’t know me, but he hated me. People that know me like me, but he just couldn’t stand me. And he was pretty strong on that.
(32:59)
And then what happened is he started to say, “I don’t like him, but he gets everything done. He rebuilt our military. We have no wars. He took out the worst terrorists in history. We don’t have any problems.” We didn’t have one terror attack during my administration with all the terror attacks all over the world.
(33:21)
We didn’t have countries fighting each other. They wouldn’t have done it without my permission. They would call me up to ask whether or not they could go to war with some other country. And I said, “You can’t do that. And if you do that, I’m going to put big, big taxes all over you.” Okay. We won’t do it, and then call me up the next day. We’ve decided not to go to the war.
(33:39)
We had no wars. Israel was free. Ukraine was free. The whole world. Viktor Orbán, who’s the prime minister of Hungary, he said, “If you want to solve…” because now, everything’s blowing up. The Middle East is going to end up in World War. III. Ukraine is going to end up in World War III. So many different… We could end up in World War III with incompetent leadership. With smart leadership, it had never happened. But it’s suffered now that it would’ve been three, four years ago. I mean, the whole place.
(34:09)
And more importantly, no matter what you do, you can’t get those cities back. You can’t get that civilization back, and you can’t get three or four million lives back. You can’t do it. But Gutfeld said, on the show, he said, “I don’t love this guy. But, man, everything he touches, he fixes. He gets it done. Our country was doing great. We had the best economy.”
(34:35)
And he asked for an interview, and I said, “I’ll do it, but I’m begrudgingly 10 minutes.” I don’t really want to do it because he doesn’t like me. I guess I don’t like anybody that doesn’t like me, I’ll be honest. When they don’t like me, I don’t like them. Okay. Sounds childish. Look at the wall, Mr. Wall. Stand up please, Mr. Wall. When they don’t like me, Lee, I don’t like them. That’s the way it is. Call it a personality defect. But we did an interview, and it was supposed to be 15 minutes, and it lasted for two and a half hours. There was a great chemist who actually liked each other. And he likes me. And he took that interview, and he put it on five shows and his ratings went through the roof, and he’s held it. He’s is the hottest guy on late night and beyond late night maybe in a lot of ways.
(35:26)
But we love Sean Hannity too, right? And we love Laura and we love Jesse and Jeanine and Pete. We like Pete Hegseth. Ainsley’s good. We have a lot of good people. And then we have some bad ones too, including on Fox. Do you ever notice on Fox? They put me on, I do a great job, and then they follow me with a horrible commercial. I say, “What the hell is the good of me doing it if you…” Roger Ailes never allowed bad commercials. What’s the purpose of me doing a nice show, and then they put nine horrible commercials on, which are all lies? Or they put somebody on that’s good. And then they always feel like they have to put somebody on his bad. So the net result is a neutral. And you say, “What are you doing it for? You can’t do that.”
(36:13)
Fox should put just the good people on the people that want to make America great again. They shouldn’t put the guys that are professional scammers, and they shouldn’t allow bad commercials. Just a few months ago, Kamala imposed a natural gas export ban. Can you believe that? That is brutalizing Pennsylvania energy jobs. You know about it, right? And Kamala’s Green New Deal insanity, I call it the Green New Scam, is shutting down power plants all across America.
(36:42)
As a result, Pennsylvania electricity prices are up despite all of the oil and gas and everything are up 35% in a very short period of time with all that stuff underneath you, underneath your feet, in particular you. Since she took office, we are looking at another rise now of anywhere from 30 to 50% very quickly. And we have so much. We have so much. And you’re hit about as hard as anybody. If you vote for me, I will cut your energy and electricity prices in half within 12 months. We’re going to cut them down in half.
(37:23)
I will terminate the natural gas export ban, which makes it impossible for you to sell your product to a lot of countries that want it desperately because they don’t have what we have. We are so rich. We have the greatest, and we don’t use it. It makes you frilly. We have all of this stuff more than anybody. We don’t use it. I will get Pennsylvania energy workers pumping, fracking, drilling and producing like never before, right?
(37:57)
And I don’t know about how you feel, but I do, because this was the greatest company in the world 60 or 70 years ago. We are also going to keep US Steel right here in America.
(38:19)
We have to be strong and powerful again. And we must put tariffs on foreign predators, they are predators, so that they don’t destroy our steel industry. The people that liked me the most of the steel, they were dead when I came into office. They were dead. And I put taxes on China. China was dumping massive amounts of steel to destroy our companies. I put a 50% tariff. Then, I raised it in some cases to 100%.
(38:44)
And at a certain level, they said, “No Mas. We’re not doing it.” Remember No Mas, Roberto. We love Roberto Duran though. And No Mas, No Mas. And they said, “No Mas,” and that was the end of it. And our steel companies were saved and thrived. And now we’re losing our steel companies again because we have stupid people in the White House. We must keep our steel companies, and we must keep making steel more than any…
(39:08)
If we have a war, are we going to call up, “Gee, China, could you send us some steel plays?” Oh, I forgot about that. If we have a war, think of it. If we need it for our military, how do we build our tanks? How do we build our ships? We wouldn’t have any steel. We have to make US Steel great again. Doesn’t have to be what it was. It was the greatest company in the world. Think of it. US Steel was the greatest company in the whole world. That would be like whatever. Today, our big companies are like Google and this and that. They’re not the same. UUS Steel is the strength. Google is all…. Give me a break. Not the same. Not the same.
(39:55)
You see all the stuff that Google and Facebook and all what, they got caught cheating on the last election, the bad things they did, the 51 agents and all of the stuff, the laptop. Remember, it was Russia. It was Russia, Russia, Russia. And now, it was Hunter, Hunter, Hunter, as we said. And they affected the election very much. It came out many, many points, 11 points, 12 points. But that’s what we have. And we can never let that happen again. And I said, “We’re going to go after anybody that gets caught cheating on the election.” We’re going to go after them harder than anyone’s ever been sought before, because these people are really a threat. They are a threat to democracy. The Democrats are a threat to democracy. That’s the real threat.
(40:42)
Under my plan, America will be a manufacturing superpower. Once again, we will be the envy of the world, and we will build that incredible future right here in Pennsylvania. Boy, did I come close. I almost said… I better be careful because [inaudible 00:41:07] they’ll report it because I don’t want to be…. Should I say it, Uncle Sam? I almost said to state of Pennsylvania, but I said, I meant the Commonwealth. I never said the state. I was able to catch it because I’m cognitively very strong. Very, very strong.
(41:28)
I was able to catch it. Did you notice that right here? And I stopped for a second. I said, “Pennsylvania.” Oh, that’s a bad…When you do the state of Pennsylvania, you get yourself.
(41:42)
I’ve seen it. Well, the worst was Biden. He’s in Florida, and he says, “Thank you for being so nice. I love Iowa. I’ve always loved…” Remember, he was in New Hampshire, and he said he was in Maine. I never did that. If you do that, it’s career threatening. As it turned out, it was career threatening. But if you do that once… Winston Churchill was a great speaker. Great. I get much bigger crowds than him, but nobody ever says I’m a great speaker.
(42:12)
Winston Churchill was a great speaker. If he ever was in London, and he said, “I’m in Beirut,” because Biden is capable of that. He could go that far off. He compared Florida to Iowa. And then he said it was Idaho, the greatest potato place in the world. And he said with Iowa, remember, he said, “I love the potatoes in Iowa,” don’t he meant, right?
(42:40)
He didn’t mean Iowa. I mean the whole thing. But I said, if you were Winston Churchill and you make a mistake as to location, I’m here with you. And if I say it’s great to be in the great state of Illinois, can happen. No matter how great your speech is, you could make the greatest speech in history and people will go, “That was a disaster.” He did it all the time, but she’s worse than him. I’m telling you, watch. She’s not as smart as him. He’s not smart. He never was smart. He wasn’t smart 40 years ago. He was a hale and hearty guy, well-met. Did you ever hear Shakespeare? He was hale and hearty and well-met, but he wasn’t a smart person. But she is a very dumb person. And we can’t do that. We can’t do that. I don’t want to be rude. I don’t want to be rude.
(43:39)
I don’t want to be rude. Another front in Kamala’s war on workers is her gigantic migrant invasion. Over the past three years, borders are… Do you notice she said, “I’m not a border czar.” She was a border czar for three and a half years. Now, she’s saying I had nothing to do… Whether she was the border czar or just the person in charge of the border, it’s been the worst thing ever. Maybe one of the worst things ever to happen to our country.
(44:05)
Look at what’s happening in Springfield, Ohio. Look at what’s happened to that beautiful town? Look at what’s happened to Aurora in Colorado where you have a radical left Democrat governor who doesn’t have a clue. He is so scared. The Venezuelans are attacking. They’re in the real estate business. They’re taking over real estate, like I was, but they take it over with guns.
(44:32)
I took it over with the brain. They take it over with guns. Think of it, Aurora, and they have weapons that the military doesn’t even have, AK-47s. I learned about AK-47s three weeks ago. That’s not a nice… I’m getting very good at learning about weapons. I’m learning a lot about guns.
(44:51)
Over the past three years, borders czar, Harris, has inundated small towns all across America with hundreds of thousands of migrants. Not only has she invited them across our border, unfortunately, she’s also illegally flown them. And remember, she was making excuses. “No, no, we haven’t really had too many.”
(45:10)
And then we found out that they’re flying in by big, big, beautiful jets. They’re flying over the border. She’s trying to say that the border was sort of secure. It wasn’t secure, although the greatest graph in the history of graphs, a thing that I love, perhaps as much as any person I’ve ever met, is my wonderful graph on immigration and the lack of people coming. Do we have that graph? Can we put that graph up? This is my favorite graph. Oh, I love it. I love it. I love it. I love that graph, Lee. David, I love it.
(45:56)
Oh, isn’t that a beautiful. I don’t care what it says. Don’t care if it said I did a lousy job. That’s the most beautiful piece of paper I’ve ever seen. You see the arrow in the bottom? That was the week that I left office. See the arrow in the bottom, the big red arrow. That’s the lowest level. This was done by the border patrol. This looks like a Trump special. It wasn’t. That was done by the US Border patrol who are phenomenal. ISIS is phenomenal. That was done by the border patrol. That was the lowest level of immigration we’ve ever had in the country.

Crowd (46:30):

[inaudible 00:46:31].

Donald Trump (46:32):

And then these idiots, these stupid idiots took over. And look at what happened to our numbers. Look at what happened. Look at what happened to the numbers. But is that the most beautiful… I love the colors, the blue, the gold, the red. There’s everything about it. I love, I love the stars because if I didn’t look over to the right to see that beautiful graph, I said, “Put up that graph. Please.”
(46:59)
If I didn’t look over to the right, I wouldn’t be here with you tonight. And that would be a very terrible… What a beautiful thing. Think of it, Uncle Sam. Immigration saved my life. Think of it. Immigration saved my life. No. It’s great. Well, thank you. And thank you. I sleep with that face every night. I go to bed with it. See, darling. Darling, it’s time to go to bed. Let’s go. What a beautiful site. Thank you very much. Okay. Thank you. Great job that you were able to get it so fast. I didn’t think we were going to be using it. I didn’t think I was going to use it in Butler. It was just, I always use it at the end if I use it. I only use it, you would know. You go to every damn rally, right?
(47:52)
He’s at every rally, and he makes a lot of money. I think he’s probably an accountant. He’s a CPA. He’s a genius. But he goes to every rally. But right. I rarely use it. But when I use, it’s always on my left, and it’s always at the end of the speech. This time, I just thought of it. As you can see, I don’t use the teleprompter too much. Isn’t it nice to have a president that doesn’t have to use a teleprompter? Isn’t that nice? Right? It’s really nice.
(48:42)
Thank you very much. By the way, we had a rally, and Lee’s part of the woods out in Long Island, and that was unbelievable. We filled up where the Islanders play and the Nets were playing. They used to play there, a big like a Madison Square Garden type arena. We filled it up. We could have filled it up three times. It was an amazing, just less than a week ago, right? That was great. Lee was there.
(49:06)
Kamala has illegally flown in more than a half a million migrants when she was saying, “No, no, we don’t want to do that.” These guys actually want these people in our country. It’s not even believable. Working with left-wing nonprofits to inundate Pennsylvania communities, changing the character of small towns and villages all over our country, and changing them forever. They will never be the same. They will never be. Do you think Springfield will ever be the same? I don’t think. The fact is, and I’ll say it now, you have to get them the hell out. You have to get them out. I’m sorry. Get them out. Can’t have it. Can’t have it. They’ve destroyed it.

Crowd (49:54):

[inaudible 00:50:06].

Donald Trump (50:06):

It’s terrible. It’s terrible to say. And it’s a tough thing to do. You’re going to take in some murderers and things.And you’ll put them on the planes and the buses, and you’re going to start doing it. Dwight Eisenhower holds the record, believe it or not. He was a moderate kind of a guy. General Eisenhower, president, and he has the record. He couldn’t stand people pouring into our country. And he took a lot and took them, a very strong on that.
(50:28)
And we have to be strong. We have no choice because this is not sustainable by any country. There’s no country that can do this. What were they thinking when they did it? What were they thinking? This is like, who would allow men to play in women’s sports? Well, this is bigger. This is bigger. But it’s the same thought. Who would allow? We’re allowing open borders where millions of people that we have no idea who they are, where they come from. We don’t know if they’re murderers, if they’re killers. Many are murderers though, because prison populations are being released into our country.
(51:02)
And these are tough people. They’re tough people, and they’re vicious evil people in many cases that we can’t have. But it’s very tough because we’ll take one young woman with two children, and they’ll put them in a bus to take them back to some country. And it will be put in the fake news. And it will be terrible story. It’s terrible. And the whole country will turn against. It’s a very tough thing to do. We have to do it carefully. But we have to get murderers and drug dealers and all these people that are coming into our country where we have to get them out of here. It’s not sustainable.
(51:39)
And not far from here, the 4,000 person town of Charleroi, there’s people… Do people. In Charleroi, Pennsylvania seen a 2000% increase in the population of town. Do you know that? Right? Has your town changed slightly? Where are you from? Charleroi, put up… Okay. Good. I just took a picture with that handsome guy.
(52:09)
So would you say your town has changed just a little bit over the last couple of months? Is it a different place, totally different place?

Crowd (52:20):

We’re everywhere.

Donald Trump (52:21):

It’s what?

Crowd (52:22):

It’s completely different.

Donald Trump (52:24):

It’s completely different. Where are the other people that started screaming about Charleroi? Where are they? Okay. Has your beautiful town changed?

Crowd (52:35):

Yes.

Donald Trump (52:36):

Yes. You can’t do it. 80%, think of it, of the capital, and it’s composed of lawless gangs. We’re not going to do this. All of the gang members, MS-13, they’re brought into our country, because Venezuela doesn’t want to… Remember this, Venezuela has sent their criminals into our country, has emptied their jails. Not fully. They’ve still got people, but I don’t know why, because I would’ve been worse than him. I would’ve emptied it. If I ran one of those countries, Honduras, any of them, even Mexico, to an extent is doing it. And they shouldn’t be doing it at all because they’re getting rich off of us. They’re getting rich. They shouldn’t be doing it at all. They’re going to stop immediately.
(53:24)
But so many of these countries… I would do it. If I were the president of one of these countries, and they’re all smart street-smart people, I would’ve had them all. I don’t know why Venezuela does, but they have a lot of the jail population in our country. They probably couldn’t get enough buses and planes. That’s probably the only reason. But they’re dumping jail populations, the criminals of the street, into our country. And there’s only one thing that can happen. And it’s really bad. And it’s happening. And now, you see it. And I said this three years ago when I heard about it, I said, “This is only going to be bad.”
(53:57)
Think of the cruelty Kamala Harris is inflicting on the people of Pennsylvania. You live in a small town your whole life. You pay your taxes. You really are exemplary. You pay everything. You do everything. You love your town. You love your country. You know the town so well by name. You’re just so proud of it.
(54:16)
And suddenly, she flies in thousands and thousands of migrants from the most dangerous places on earth, and they deposit them right smack in the middle of your community. And you’re a nice person. And you want to be politically correct. I see it. I see it very much in the cities. Like the governor of Colorado, the guys are real stiff, but he’s up talking and he says, “Well, these are fine people.” He doesn’t want to say that they have AK-47s, and they’re taking over large portions of real estate. He doesn’t want to say it. They want to be politically correct. It’s happening in all of these towns that we’re talking about, because the mayors are afraid. And they’re afraid politically too. They don’t know. Am I supposed to say this is good, or am I supposed to say… And Democrat mayors, every one of them is saying it’s a wonderful thing, and not one of them believes it, but they’re afraid to go against the stupid party that’s in Washington.
(55:14)
So now, your schools can teach because the majority… They can’t teach because the majority of students don’t speak the language. The housing market is destroyed. Crime is rampant. The jobs are taken by migrants illegally imported to our countries. Your school classes, you can’t get in. You can’t get into your hospitals. Nobody can get into the hospitals. They’re driving to hospitals three, 400 miles away.
(55:38)
The media is desperate to stop us from having this conversation. The fake news, look at all of them. They have a lot of people. Oh, they have some of the big ones. They have some of the big ones. Wow. Oh, that’s very impressive.
(55:54)
They have some good ones too. But that’s exactly why we must have this conversation. We have to have it because the media doesn’t want to talk about it. They don’t want to do anything that’s going to embarrass Kamala, because I don’t know why. Number one, the country’s going to die. They’re going to die. They’re already dying to a large extent.
(56:14)
But if I get elected, they’re going to do much better because we get higher ratings. Greg Gutfeld got the highest ratings in the history of his show. And think of it, the number one show of the night, including networks. Nobody knows that. And maybe I think the number one show of the week.

Crowd (56:31):

[inaudible 00:56:31].

Donald Trump (56:32):

No. But they’ll do much better. But they don’t realize that. They haven’t realized that yet. This isn’t an attack on any group of people. It’s common sense. We’re really talking about we’re the party of common sense. We’re conservative, all that. We are the party of common sense. That’s what we are. That’s what we are.
(56:49)
We want to have strong borders, great education, school choice. As everybody like school choice. We want to move the Department of Education. We’re ranked at the bottom of the list, the worst. We spend more money per pupil than any other country by far. And yet, we’re at the bottom of the list. At 40, we’re ranked about number 40. And I’m going to close the Department of Education and move education back to the states. And we’re going to do it fast.
(57:22)
Maybe, I’ll have you do that. I’ll use Lee. Maybe, I’ll have you. You could do it. That’s not too easy. We’ll get somebody great. We’ll get Lee Zeldin is here with us tonight. I think, that’s the job for Lee or Vivek. Oh, we’ll get somebody. We like Vivek. We need somebody with a lot of energy, a lot of strength, energy and intelligence.
(57:44)
But it takes centuries to build the unique character of each state. And we are going to. And when you do that, so the number one rated country is Norway. The number two is Denmark, and on and on it goes, spend much less money than we do. And they have the finest education. And New York City a few years ago with De Blasio, who is one of the worst bears in history, by the way, he said, “We’re going to go with the Norwegian system.” That didn’t work out too well. When they start throwing the teachers out the window, that wasn’t working out. They don’t do that in Norway.
(58:18)
Historically, they haven’t thrown too many teachers out the window in Norway. But we’re going to make it good. And you know what’s going to happen, is out of the 50 states, you’re going to have 35 like different ones. Iowa will do good. A lot of the states will do very good.
(58:35)
I can think of probably 30, 35 will be… And five will be okay. 10 will be okay. You’ll have four or five that will be terrible, but that’s okay. We have to control it. But you’ll have Idaho. You’ll have Idaho will do a great job. No debt, no this. They run a great state. A lot of places will have education that can compete with Norway and Denmark, but we’ll have certain places. And it’s the same places like Gavin Newsom, who is a terrible governor. You’ll probably have a problem in California.
(59:14)
But what you do is you give it to the local communities, and they’ll have a great educational system. You don’t want to give it to somebody like Kamala because she destroyed San Francisco, and then destroyed the whole state. But reckless migration policy can change it very quickly, and it can destroy everything in its way, just like we’ve seen in London and Paris and Minneapolis.
(59:37)
Look at what’s happened in London. Look what’s happening in Paris. If Kamala Harris wins this election, she will flood Pennsylvania cities and towns with illegal migrants from all over the world. And Pennsylvania will never be the same. You’ll never be the same.
(59:56)
When I’m president, all migrant flights to Pennsylvania will stop immediately. By the way, all migrant flights, not only to Pennsylvania everywhere. No, but how about they get caught? We just found that out a few months ago. They’re saying, “No, no, we’re fighting.” In the meantime, people were just pouring and, “No, no, we want to do it.” And then we learned that the airplanes are flying. That means that it was just a big con job.
(01:00:23)
Remember this, for a long time, she’s been talking about her experience at McDonald’s. I worked at McDonald’s over the French fries. It was so hot. I think I’m going to go to a McDonald’s next week someplace. I’m going to go might not be here in your place. I’m going to go to a McDonald’s, and I’m going to work the French fry job for about a half an hour. I want to see how it is.
(01:00:48)
But she said she worked, and she grew up in terrible condition. She worked at McDonald’s. She never worked there. And these fake news reporters will never report it. They don’t want to report it because they’re fake. They’re fake.
(01:01:04)
They don’t want to report it. She never worked at McDonald’s. But it was a big part of her resume. They went to the different places. Did she work here? Did she work here? Did she work here? She said, “We don’t know who the hell she is. Leave us alone. We’re making hamburgers.”
(01:01:21)
We’ll end the invasion of small town Pennsylvania, and we will end the destruction of America. It’s destroying our country. This country is going to be better than ever before. But we have to do certain things, and we have to do it for [inaudible 01:01:40].
(01:01:39)
And this is one of the big reasons that we’re leading in the polls in Pennsylvania, but I think we’re doing a lot better than even the polls say. In the latest Emerson Poll, we’re up in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Georgia, pretty substantially in today’s latest New York Times. If the New York Times gives me a good poll, you know we’re way up. The Siena Poll, we’re up in North Carolina by three, in Georgia by four, and in Arizona by five. Those are swing states.
(01:02:14)
And a poll on a state that Republicans just haven’t won in many, many years for president, you have a wonderful governor there who’s really working, Glenn Youngkin, he’s working hard. He’s really pushing it hard. He’s in charge of it, and he’s doing a good job. A poll just came out in Virginia where we’re leading in the state of Virginia leading. If we win Virginia, I don’t even know if I need Pennsylvania, but we want to get it anyway. We want to get Pennsylvania.
(01:02:44)
Remember last time, so last time, we did better than 60. But in 2016, we were leading by hundreds of thousands of votes in Pennsylvania, and they refused to announce it, remember? And then they announced Wisconsin or Michigan, which we won. But all night long, I said, “When are they going to announce Pennsylvania?” It would be impossible to catch us based on the numbers, if I lost every vote from then until the end. But they waited until two o’clock in the morning. You know why they did that? Right? They were trying to see if they could accumulate enough ballots. Very dangerous thing.
(01:03:18)
This is a bad, bad system. And we’re winning Pennsylvania, but despite the fact that I almost hate to say that we’re winning. Why don’t I say we’re tied, so you go out and vote, or we’re down by one. I always say, “Pretend you’re down by one.” The point is, you got to get a vote. We got to win, and we got to win and can’t take any chances.
(01:03:40)
But here in Pennsylvania, you also need to vote for your next Senator Dave McCormick, who I know for a long time, and he’s going to defeat Bob Casey. He’s going to stop inflation and secure our borders.

Donald Trump (01:04:04):

Do you want to come up for a second? Do you mind? I love this guy. He’s a military hero, he’s a business hero and he’ll make a great senator. Come on up, David. Say something.

Speaker 2 (01:04:22):

Hi, Mr. President. Thank you. All right. Well, Mr. President, thank you so much for that great introduction and we’re going to win the Presidency right here in a Senate majority in the keystone state. So thank you. And the reason we’re going to win is because people in Pennsylvania feel like they’ve lost their economic security; prices going out of control, the war on fossil fuels. They’ve lost their physical security; crime in our cities, illegal immigration, 4000 fentanyl deaths, and people around the world, adversaries, challenging us. So people in Pennsylvania want change, and what I tell them is listen, it’s a battle between common sense and these radical liberal policies under Kamala Harris. And Bob Casey is going to vote for her 99% of the time because he is a weak leader and a rubber stamp for this liberal agenda.
(01:05:19)
And I say also, this is a race between strength and weakness. And when I talk about strength with G.T. Thompson and Sean Parnell, I say listen, I was standing there at Butler, 15 feet away. I saw you get shot, I saw you go down, and I saw you come up with your fist and say, “Fight, fight, fight.” That’s why we’re going to win. Thank you, sir.

Donald Trump (01:05:50):

Thank you. Thank you very much. And he’s a good man, I’ll tell you. Very successful guy. He goes through a lot to do this. And Bob Casey, I could tell you, I was there for four years at the highest, highest, highest level, I met everybody, this guy does nothing for Pennsylvania. He’s not going to help your oil, your fracking, he’s not going to help anything. And David will be a warrior for your commonwealth. He will be a warrior. Total warrior. So thank you, David. Thank you very much.
(01:06:28)
We’re also pleased to be joined … oh, I have so many people here. I have so many. I have congressmen, I have senators, it’s brutal. When you introduce people, you always miss a couple of them, but I’m going to apologize because I see somebody there that I think is a certain senator, but I’m not 100% sure. The eyes aren’t what they used to be, I’ll be totally honest. The brain is better than it used to be, but the eyes aren’t what they used to be. You always get yourself in trouble, but I’m going to introduce somebody that’s been amazing, Congressman Glenn ‘G.T.’ Thompson, who’s sitting with us. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, G.T. Thank you very much. Great job. He’s a warrior.
(01:07:10)
Former Congressman, Fred Keller. Fred, thank you very much. I saw him sitting there. A great gentleman who’s a real leader, state senate majority leader, Joe Pittman. Joe? Whoa. Whoa. Hey, you’re popular, Joe. What a family you have too. What a great family. Thank you very much, Joe. Mayor of Slippery Rock, J.D. Longo. Thank you, J.D. Great job. Thank you. Great job.
(01:07:47)
And a friend of mine who’s a warrior and a very strong guy, a tough guy. They had a bad, bad deal with that election. It was terrible what happened. Sean Parnell. Sean, stand up. They played around with 25,000 ballots. That was another unique one, wasn’t it? What a disgrace that was.
(01:08:12)
Anyway, we’re six weeks away from the most important election in the history of our country and here are the facts. Kamala Harris wants open borders. She will deliver rampant inflation and she wants to pack the Supreme Court. You know that. Instead of nine justices like we have now, Kamala wants to bring it up very substantially. Now, this is a number I heard two days ago, potentially to 25 justices so she can rig the system. Meaning not she, the whole party can rig the system, the party of communists. She wants to bring it up to 25. That’s the first time I heard that number, but I heard it very loud and clear. Congress is supposed to be that, not the Supreme Court. No. They were very brave, the Supreme Court, very brave, and they take a lot of hits because of it. It should be illegal what happens. You have these guys that like playing the rough, like the great Bobby Knight. These people should be put in jail the way they talk about our judges and our justices, trying to get them to sway their vote, sway their decision.
(01:09:17)
Kamala was an original creator of Defund the Police movement. Okay. So she was in Defund the Police for years. Anybody who wants to defund the police for even one week is not worthy of being President of the United States. Can you imagine? That’s where she came from. That’s where she came from. That’s her theory and that’s her way and that’s her policy. You know what the policy is? She’s changed 15 policies. Over the years, I’ve been a student of politics for a long time, but I was in the other side. I was writing checks all the time, but I was on the other side. But I’ve never seen anyone go 15 for 15. I’ve seen guys change one policy, maybe two when they were little ones. She changed everything. She loves oil all of a sudden. She loves the police. When did that start? A few months ago?
(01:10:20)
But let me tell you, they immediately go back to where they came from. Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE. These are great, great patriots, ICE. They take such hits. They are so tough and love our country so much. They get MS-13 out of our country. Under borders, our Harris, Venezuelan gangs. All these Venezuelan gangs have taken over entire areas of different places in our country and she supports free healthcare for illegal aliens while our hospitals and emergency rooms are being overrun by migrants who come up here because they say, “Come up and we’ll give you …” Look, I feel sorry. I have a bigger heart than anybody. But you can’t tell people to come up, “We’re going to give you education, we’re going to give you free healthcare,” because they’re going to come up. And if you stop saying that, they won’t come any longer. You can’t do this, and Newsom does it and all of them do it and you can’t do it. But migrants make it virtually … it’s unusable. The states become unusable; the school systems, the hospital.
(01:11:26)
This is a number that’s the worst number that you’ll ever hear. Think of a big stadium that holds 55,000 people. She lost more than 325,000 migrant children. They’re gone. Nobody knows where they are. Many of them are dead. Many of them are in sex trade, but many of them are dead. They’ve been trafficked, they’ve been raped. 325,000 children are missing. If one child is missing, it’s too many. Think of it. Under her, 325,000 children. As California attorney, she will destroy our country. As California Attorney General she redefined child sex trafficking, the term deadly weapon, and rape of an unconscious person as non-violent crimes. She said they’re all non-violent.
(01:12:29)
She praised the idea of 70 to 80% tax. She wants a tax rate of 70 to 80%. Will you be happy paying 80%? I don’t think so. She wants to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles, which will destroy the Pennsylvania way of life, and she even endorsed free sex changes. At first they said, “You’ve got to go back and tell me this.” And this was recently. She endorsed free sex changes for illegal aliens in detention centers all over our country at taxpayer expense. You don’t hear this on Oprah, do you? Think of that. Sex change. You’re detained, you’re being held in a detention center and you say, “I want to change. I want to become a woman.” And they have to give you the operation, which is an immensely expensive operation on top of everything else, $250,000 at least, and then all the drugs involved and everything else. She’s sick, I’m telling you. If you put her in, I don’t think you will either. Uncle Sam, will you put her in? I don’t think so. Stand up, Uncle Sam.
(01:13:52)
No, it’s terrible. As DA and as Attorney General, she destroyed San Francisco and she destroyed all of California. It’s like a different place. It’s not recognizable. Now she’s coming to destroy the United States of America and we’re not going to let it happen. We can’t let it happen. She led the change in California law so that if you steal less than $950, you are not prosecuted, and if you steal more than $950, you’re actually not prosecuted either. But how about this? The kids are walking in with computers, they’re adding it up so that if it’s less than 950, they go into a judge, they say, “Your Honor, it’s less than” … “Oh, okay, case dismissed.” Is this country sick? Less than $1000, you don’t get prosecuted.
(01:14:44)
She even lied about Joe Biden’s cognitive abilities. Remember? She said, “Oh, he’s fine. He’s fine.” A great disservice to the American people, because he’s negotiating with Russia, China and North Korea. He’s negotiating with people that are probably in a state of shock. They say, “Can you believe this?” Because they’re all at the top of their game. I know all of them. They’re at the top of their game. And we are at the most dangerous point in the history of our country. We could end up in World War Three because of this lunatic, and her, she’s so much worse. She wants to take away your guns and your rifles in violation of the Second Amendment. And she’s a communist, and everybody knows it, and our country is not ready for a communist President and won’t be for a long, long, long time to come. That’s why, less than two months from now, we are going to tell her that we’ve had enough. Our country can’t take it anymore. Kamala, you’ve been a terrible vice president. You’ll be the worst President in the history of our country, superseding even crooked Joe Biden. Kamala, you are a disaster to the United States of America. Kamala, you are fired. You’re fired. Get out. Get out.
(01:16:24)
All right, so we have to talk business. I always thought women liked me. I never thought I had a problem. But the fake news keeps saying women don’t like me. I don’t believe it. You know why? They like to have strong borders. They like to have safety. Nothing personal, I think they like me. Thank you. I love you too. I love you too. Thank you.
(01:16:53)
But I think they like me because I represent something that’s very important. I make this statement to the great women of our country. Sadly, women are poorer than they were four years ago, much poorer, are less healthy than they were four years ago, are less safe on the streets than they were four years ago, are paying much higher prices for groceries and everything else than they were four years ago, are more stressed and depressed and unhappy than they were four years ago, and are less optimistic and confident in the future than they were four years ago. I believe that. I will fix all of that, and fast, and at long last, this nation and national nightmare will end. It will end. We’ve got to end this national nightmare.
(01:17:55)
Because I am your protector. I want to be your protector. As President, I have to be your protector. I hope you don’t make too much of it. I hope the fake news doesn’t go, “Oh, he wants to be their protector.” Well, I am as President. I have to be your protector. I will make you safe at the border, on the sidewalks of your now violent cities, in the suburbs where you are under migrant criminal siege, and with our military protecting you from foreign enemies, of which we have many today because of the incompetent leadership that we have. You will no longer be abandoned, lonely, or scared. You will no longer be in danger. You’re not going to be in danger any longer. You will no longer have anxiety from all of the problems our country has today. You will be protected and I will be your protector.
(01:18:49)
Women will be happy, healthy, confident and free. You will no longer be thinking about abortion. That’s all they talk about, abortion, because we’ve done something that nobody else could have done. It is now where it always had to be, with the states, and they vote of the people. And it is and will be with powerful exceptions like those that Ronald Reagan insisted on, for rape, incest, and the life of the mother, but not allowing for Democrat-demanded late-term abortion in the seventh, eighth or ninth month, or even execution of a baby after birth. Thank you. Thank you very much. Such an important topic. For 52 years, all legal scholars and experts wanted abortion to be with the states and to have a vote of the people. 52 years they fought for this, Republicans, Democrats, liberals and conservatives, everyone wanted abortion out of the federal government and into the states. Six brilliant and very brave justices of the United States Supreme Court were able to do that for you and they did it. It will never move back to the federal government. We’ll never have the votes to do so and nobody should want it to, because it must now have that very important vote of the people, something sought for many, many years.
(01:20:58)
I have always defended and supported IVF fertility, and so has the Republican Party, and we gave you and give you total support on IVF. Don’t let anyone tell you different. We are much stronger than the Democrats. We want beautiful babies in our country. We want you to have your beautiful, beautiful, perfect baby. We want those babies and we need them. And I will protect women at a level never seen before. They will finally be healthy, hopeful, safe and secure. Their lives will be happy, beautiful and great again. And it’s my honor to do so. It’s my honor to do so. Because that’s all they talk about. Our country’s a mess. It’s a mess. The borders are bad, the trade is bad, the inflation is bad. It’s the worst time in your lives in our country. We’re being laughed at by everybody in the world. Everything is wrong with our country, nothing’s right, and all they talk about is abortion. The fact is, for 52 years they’ve been trying to do what we did, and the votes are all taking place in Ohio, it took place in Kansas, and it was more liberal than people would’ve thought, but it’s taking place all over the land. And the vote’s going to change and it’s being negotiated, but it’s the vote of the people and it’s with the exceptions. We want to have the exceptions. Some people have to follow their heart, but it’s hard not to have the exceptions. It really is.
(01:22:40)
But that’s all they talk about. The country’s falling apart, we’re going to end up in World War Three, and all they can talk about is abortion. That’s all they talk about. And it really no longer pertains, because we’ve done something on abortion that nobody thought was possible. And I give those three brilliant, and it’s six, but the three that we put in, but six brilliant justices of the United States Supreme Court, a tremendous hand for their intelligence, but also for their courage. It took a lot of courage to do so. It’s where everybody wanted it, every legal scholar, every legal expert.
(01:23:21)
From the moment we take back the White House from Kamala Harris, I believe we are going to have the four greatest years in the history of our country. Starting on day one, I will seal the border and we’re going to stop the migrant invasion. We will stop the migrant invasion into our country, not sustainable by any country. We will carry out the largest deportation operation of criminals in American history. Have to. We have to. I’d rather not say it. I would rather not say it, but we have to. We will end inflation and make America affordable again. It’s not affordable. I went to that store today in Pennsylvania, beautiful store. Brian, the son of the owner, what a great young man he was and we had such an incredible crowd, but he was saying how he hates to do it, but the prices are so high. We looked at a lot of the people at the checkout counter; “How are the prices?” They’re all going, “It’s terrible.” That’s all over the country. This happened because of Biden and Kamala.
(01:24:34)
While working Americans catch up, we’re going to put a temporary cap on credit card interest rates at 10%. It’s too much. They’re paying 25%, 28%. It’s too much. We are going to become energy independent again and energy dominant in a very short period of time like no other country has ever been. We will do things that no other country has ever been able to do with energy, because we have more energy than anybody else. And we are going to get ANWR that I told you about in Alaska open and operating immediately.
(01:25:18)
We will close the border. Let people come into our country, but only if they come in legally. And we will immediately drill, baby, drill. And we will stop outsourcing and turn the United States into a manufacturing superpower. We are not going to let foreign countries rip us off any longer. And we just about had it stopped and they just broke everything that … it’s just amazing. What they did is so disgraceful. We will pass the … call it Trump Reciprocal Trade Act, so if China or any other country, not only China, charges us a 100 or 200% tariff, then we will charge them the exact same 100 or 200% tariff in return. And I will not let Mexico, China, or any other country sell cars into the United States to the detriment of our auto workers. I will bring the auto industry manufacturing back into the United States. It will be. We’re going to bring it back.
(01:26:41)
Right now China is building massive car factories. They wouldn’t have started it with me, but they didn’t know that was going to happen to us four years ago. They had no idea. They had no thought that that could happen. Nobody thought that was going to happen. If I thought that I did poorly in that election, which we didn’t, we got more votes than any sitting President in history by a lot. Think of it. If I thought I lost that election, I wouldn’t be doing this. I wouldn’t be doing this. Much harder. You lose, you lose, but when that happens, you can’t let people get away with it. You cannot let people get away with it.
(01:27:22)
Our car industry and auto manufacturing will be double during my term and at a number higher than it ever was before. We’ve lost almost 60% of our automobile manufacturing over decades, and now a lot of it’s going right into Mexico. We’re going to stop that. We’re going to stop it very quickly. They weren’t doing it with me, but boy are they doing it now. I will end Kamala’s insane electric vehicle mandate.
(01:27:55)
I will always protect social security and Medicare with no cuts on social security. We’re not going to be changing the age. They’re going to end up destroying social security because they’re letting migrants into social security at numbers nobody can believe. They will destroy your social security on top of everything.
(01:28:14)
I will stop the drugs and fentanyl pouring into our country, killing our kids and our families. We will stop it. I had it down to the lowest number in 32 years and then these people took over and what happened to our border? What happened to even the drugs pouring in? Times nine, they tell me. It’s nine times more than we had. And by the way, honestly, you’ll never be able to solve that problem unless you have the death penalty for drug dealers. And it’s not something I like saying. That’s the way it is. China has no drug problem. I said to President Xi, “Do you have a drug problem?” “No, no, no, no, no.” “You don’t have a drug problem?” “No, no, no.” “What do you attribute that to?” He said, “Quick trial.” I said, “What’s quick trial?” “We take the drug dealer, we give him a quick trial, and if he’s guilty, which I guess he probably always is over there,” he said, “We immediately execute.”
(01:29:14)
You’ve got to understand something. It sounds horrible, right? Each drug dealer, he or she, during the course of their life, kills at least 500 people. And when you hear that, how many families do you know where their child had a dose of fentanyl? Not even in many cases because they were into drugs. They take another drug and it’s laced with fentanyl. Not even what you would call a bad drug. They take a medication prescribed by a doctor. It’s got fentanyl and they die right in front of the parents. We will crush all of that. We will stop it, and we’re going to stop it fast. Not going to allow it.
(01:29:56)
President Xi and I had a great conversation. I said, “You’re killing our people,” because they make it. “You’re sending it into Mexico, you’re killing our people.” And I told him what I was going to do and he was not happy about that. And we had a deal that he was going to give death penalty to any people making fentanyl and selling it into the United States. And then when Biden took over, that all failed, because these guys aren’t going to do anything. They didn’t do anything. They don’t do anything. Even if you look at the Abraham Accords, what I did for Israel, we had four countries, they still have four countries. Every country should have been signed. You would’ve had peace in the Middle East. But they took the four countries. They haven’t put one country in. One additional country. We would have it loaded up.
(01:30:42)
We will crush violent crime and protect all law enforcement, including Border patrol, ICE, Sheriffs, and Secret Service. We will protect them. We will terminate the green new scam and spend trillions of unspent dollars on roads, bridges, real infrastructure and paying down debt, and not fake infrastructure like we have under the green New Deal where it’s throwing money out the window and causing massive inflation.
(01:31:10)
I will settle the war in Ukraine and I will end the chaos in the Middle East and I will prevent World War Three. And I think I’m the only one that’s going to be able to do that. We are far down the line. And World War Three, this will be a war like no other because of the weaponry. I always say, this is no longer army tanks going back and forth shooting each other. This is nuclear power with power like nobody’s ever seen before. We will have peace through strength. That’s what we had. We had no wars during my four years. First time. Now, we wiped out ISIS 100%. We did it in four weeks. They said it would take five years, I did it in four weeks. Our military is great. Our military is not woke either. The guys on top like Millie and those guys are woke, the television guys are all woke, but the real military, you could put them in a room for two years and scream woke at them, and when they walk out, they’ll be shouting, “I’m not woke.” The job they did with me on ISIS, I inherited that whole mess with ISIS and we defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate in record time. We have a great military, which you don’t hear about.
(01:32:26)
I will support universal school choice and every parent will be empowered to send their child to the public, private, religious, or charter school that is right for them. We will rebuild our cities, including Washington DC, which are a horror show, making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. We’re going to rebuild our cities. We’ll have to work with Democrats and that’s okay, but we’re going to get them cleaned up and we’re going to make them safe, because right now you can’t walk across the street in our cities, including Washington DC, the capitol. We’re going to clean it up, make it beautiful again, and make it safe again. And we will keep the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency, because it is failing right now. And if we lose that, it’d be like losing a war.
(01:33:14)
This is how we will end the era of inflation, mayhem and misery under Kamala and Crooked Joe, and unleash safety, prosperity, and peace for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. Every single race, religion, color, and creed. We’re going to take care of it all together. We will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates and low inflation so that everyone can afford groceries, a car and a home. It’s the American dream. We’re bringing back the American dream. We will stop the invasion. We’ll end migrant crime, which is at a level that nobody can believe except me, because I said it. As soon as I heard what they were doing with the open border, I couldn’t believe it. We built hundreds of miles of wall and all we had to do is flip up some additional wall panels. We would’ve picked up 200 miles more. That’s much more than I ever said I was going to build. And they didn’t do it. And then I realized they wanted open borders. I couldn’t believe it.
(01:34:18)
We’re going to strengthen our military, build a missile defense shield around our country. We’re going to keep critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools, and we are going to keep men out of women’s sports. You saw the Olympics, with the boxing, with the beautiful, young Italian girl fighting a person who transitioned. Muhammad Ali would’ve been scared of this person. Transitioned. And the left is a defensive shot, so boom, he gets a left, hits her in the face. She didn’t know what the hell hit her. It was like a horse. I never saw this before. She walked back to her corner. She said, “I just got hit with something. What happened?” They said, “Give it another try. Maybe she was just … he was just lucky.” Sorry, I could get in trouble for that. Uncle Sam said, “No, you got it right.” But no. So she goes back out, boom, does another left, just a jab. She gets hit. She quits. She says, “That’s it. I can’t fight. This person just hurt me really badly with two little jabs.” And that person went on to very easily win the gold medal.
(01:35:39)
There was another person who transitioned, Uncle Sam, also. Different country, transitioned, different weight class, transitioned, won the gold medal. So you had two people that transitioned, both happened to win the gold medal. Is anybody surprised by that? These people are sick. And you know what? It’s so demeaning to women. So demeaning

Donald Trump (01:36:00):

… demeaning to women, when you think of it. We will defend the Second Amendment, protect religious liberty and restore free speech. And we will secure our election. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. But for that to happen, we must defeat Comrade Kamala Harris, and we must stop her country-destroying liberal agenda once and for all. You must get out and vote. You have to get out and vote. Everyone here promise me, “I’ll vote.” We want a landslide that’s too big to rig. They can’t do anything about it. At a certain level, there’s not a thing.
(01:36:43)
They cheat like dogs. They cheat so badly. People say, “Oh, it’s a terrible thing to say.” The people that know know exactly what I’m talking about. You know who knows better than anybody else? Democrat leaders. Those are the ones. On November 5th, it will be considered, you watch, the most important day in the history of our country. We will save our economy. We will save our country on November 5th. We will rescue our middle class. We will reclaim our sovereignty and restore our borders. We will put America first and we will take back our country.
(01:37:19)
Together, we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. We will make America free again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, Pennsylvania. God bless you. God bless you, Pennsylvania, go vote.

Donald Trump (01:48:01):

Thank you very much, Pennsylvania. Thank you. Thank you. It’s great to be back in this beautiful commonwealth with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. That’s what you are. And when I look at this crowd and I look at the crowd outside and we stopped a couple of places and nobody’s ever seen anything like it, let me tell you, they have us up in the polls, as you know in Pennsylvania and all over the place actually. But when they say we’re three points up or four, there’s no way. It’s got to be a hell of a lot more than that. It has to be.
(01:48:54)
Polls are fake also, just like these people, the fake news. We prove that. We prove that a lot. Well, I just want to thank you. We are here today because early voting begins in Pennsylvania over the next two weeks, and we need each and every one of you to go out. Just don’t take anything for granted. We have to win Pennsylvania. Go out and make a plan to vote early, vote absentee or vote in person on election day. But you got to get out and vote. You got to say to your husband, Harry, get the hell off that couch. We can’t take any chances because our nation is at stake. Our nation is going to hell. What they’ve done to our country at the border with inflation, with that Afghanistan nightmare that was the most embarrassing day probably in the history of our country. The way they did that.
(01:49:52)
Getting out was fine, but you get out with dignity and strength. What they did was so bad. When you look at October 7th in Israel, it would’ve never happened. And you look at the Russian attack of Ukraine would’ve never ever happened. Not even a thought of it. Think of it. Think of how different this world would’ve been. Think of how different this country would’ve been. Our country, which is just going so bad, it’s so bad. Millions and millions of people are pouring into our country and they come from jails. They come from mental institutions and insane asylums. They’re terrorists at a level, the terrorists at a level that nobody’s ever seen before and they let them come in and you have the border czar, this person that can’t even speak. She can’t ask a question. She can’t answer a question from…
(01:50:43)
She gets out. Oprah Winfrey, who I used to know well, she used to love me until I decided to run for politics. Oh, let’s go to Mar-a-Lago, Donald. I love the place so much. She used to love me. But once I ran for politics, that was the end of that and that was okay with me. I couldn’t care less because we got to make our country great again. Going to make it great again, greater than ever before. But Oprah would ask just a simple question and you get this crazy answer or you don’t get any answer. Just this is not a president. We had four years of this. We’re not going to have four more years. We won’t survive it. I also want you to promise to find at least one voter and get them out to the polls. Find these people. There’s so many people.
(01:51:30)
If everybody votes… It’s interesting. Christians, we got to get the Christians to vote. I don’t know what it is. Relatively, they don’t vote a lot. They go to church and they love church and that’s great, but we got to get Christians, evangelicals. We have to get them out to vote. We have to get gun owners. Gun owners don’t vote. They don’t vote. We have to get them out. The NRA gave me their total endorsement. They have every time, total complete endorsement, but they vote at levels that are very low. You know what it is? It’s probably rebellion. They’re rebelling, but there’s nothing to rebel about. You have to get out. If we had Christians voting in full strike, we couldn’t lose. If we had the gun owners voting at full strike, we couldn’t lose. We have to get gun owners because your guns are under siege. She wants to take your guns away. Our entire nation is counting on the people of this great Commonwealth. And I know you will not let us down. You’re not going to let us down. We got to get out and vote. And you can start right away. You know that? Right now we have this stupid stuff where you can vote 45 days early. I wonder what the hell happens during that 45. Let’s move these votes. We’ve got about a million votes in there. Let’s move them. We’re fixing the air conditioner in the room, right? No, it’s terrible. What happened the last time was disgraceful, including right here. But we’re not going to let it happen again. Too big to rig, right? That’s one way you do it. Can’t let it happen. We got to take our country back from these horrible people because if we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing. It’s very simple, right?
(01:53:16)
43 days from now, 43 days, we’ve been waiting for four years. Four years. We had people that were so incompetent. They were the most incompetent leaders in the whole world. And she is worse than sleepy Joe Biden. She’s worse. She’s worse. 43 days from now, we’re going to win Pennsylvania and take our country back and we’re going to be so happy. And it’ll be the most important day and the most important vote in the history of our country because we’re losing our country. I mean, somebody I heard the other day, pretty smart person, and you think about it, and it could be true, they said, if we don’t win this election, there may never be another election in this country. It could happen. Look at Venezuela. Venezuela was the most prosperous country. And now you take a look and can you believe these stupid people are buying oil from Venezuela?
(01:54:29)
From Venezuela, who was our enemy? They foreclosed on his airplane, a crappy old airplane, but they’re giving him billions of dollars for oil. It’s not oil, it’s tar. And for the environmentalists, you know where they cure the tar, where they take the tar and they make it into beautiful oil, used in Texas. That it all goes flying up in the air. You ought look into that one for all of you wonderful people that talk about the environment. Like I do, like many of the people in this room do, but they do it… The oil refinery is in… It’s the only one that can do it because it literally is tar. It’s not good stuff. We have the best stuff and we have most, we have more liquid gold under our feet and we’re buying oil from Venezuela. We don’t need it at all. It’s crazy. These people are crazy. What a nice-looking man. Who is that? Oh, that’s Trump. What a wonderful-looking person. I’m just checking out the hairstyle as I’m talking.
(01:55:30)
I don’t know. No, I’m talking and I’m looking up. I’m saying I don’t love it. Everyone don’t love it. What the hell can you do? There’s nothing I can do about it. Right? We’re stuck with it. Kamala Harris is reportedly given this speech in Pittsburgh. Her speeches are very short, about her plan to quote build wealth. She doesn’t know anything about building wealth, but she’s been in office for three and a half years. She’s saying what she’s going to do if she becomes president, but she’s been there almost four years. He hasn’t done anything except destroy our country with millions of people that shouldn’t be here. And inflation. And inflation. What the damage that Sleepy Joe… I’m tending to call him Sleepy Joe lately. I called him Crooked Joe, but now he’s not like… Who’s our president? We don’t even have… Do we have a president?
(01:56:48)
Why doesn’t he leave? Why doesn’t he leave? Now think of it. Think of it. I call him Crooked Joe. That was very effective. It got him out of the race. I mean, guess no. We had a debate and he didn’t do too well in that debate. And they came to him and they said, you’re down 21 points and you’re going to lose. This can only happen to me. So I end up with somebody new. But here’s the thing, all I have to do is expose her for what she is. She’s a communist. Okay? She’s a communist. This country is not ready for a communist and hopefully never will be because that doesn’t work. Kamala talks about all these things that she’s going to do, but she’s been here. Think of it. She’s been here for almost four years and she’s not done anything. I will do this.
(01:57:38)
I will do that. I will do this. What the hell? She could do them today. They talk about the border. Oh, we have a plan for the border. I didn’t have any help. I had very hostile Congress. And what I did is I said, close the border, to the border patrol. They’re great. And the border was closed. We had the safest border in the history of our country. And that border was a mess. In 2016, I think I won maybe because of the border. The border was very bad. And in 2020 I couldn’t talk about the border because there was no problem. My people, my geniuses back there. They all said, “Sir, you can’t really talk about the border. There’s no problem.” I said, well, I want to at least talk about I fix it. They said, people don’t care, sir. They don’t care. So I didn’t talk about the border, but we did get millions of more votes. If you remember 2020, we got millions more votes. Millions. Look at that guy with a rug on over there. Look at him. Look at that handsome guy.
(01:58:40)
You look good. He looks good. But we got millions more votes. But I’ll tell you what, and we’ve been all over Pennsylvania today, 2016 or 2020, we never had the enthusiasm that we have right now. Look at this. And the reason is because they’re so bad. We never had anything to compare it to. They’re so bad. Four years of destroying our country, we don’t have a great country anymore. Remember I had KAG, keep America great, but I couldn’t use it because they said America’s not great. I hate to say it, but America soon will be greater than ever before. You watch, we got to win the election. We got to win the election. And I can’t call her Harris either. You know Harris? When I say Harris, nobody knows… Does that make sense? I say… And when Harris, everyone says, who’s Harris? Nobody knows this person. No, they don’t know her by the name Harris. They know her Kamala. It’s strange. The name Harris. And when Harris and people say, who is that Harris? Nobody knows who the hell I’m talking about. Do you know that?
(01:59:59)
Lee, nobody knows you’re a good lawyer. Maybe we have to change your name, but nobody knows a nice name Harris. I know some people named Harris. They’re nice people. She happens to be not a nice person. She happens to be a person that’s destroyed everything she’s ever touched. Kamala’s ruinous economic policies have already cost the typical household $29,000 through rampant inflation, 29,000 per household. She’s a one woman economic wrecking ball. And if she gets four more years, her radical agenda will smash the economy into rubble and grind your financial situation right into the dust. You can’t have it. You can’t have it. We’ve had it. We’ve had it. The guy is incompetent and she’s incompetent also. She had the other interview with the other guy who was a nice guy, I think from Philadelphia, from Pennsylvania. And he was a nice guy who was asking her all these… They don’t take like I do. Anybody who wants to go, go what the hell difference does it make? And how dishonest was ABC? It was three on one.
(02:01:12)
How about this? David Muir and the other woman, I never heard of her. I don’t know how the hell did she get there. Never heard of it. But David Muir, when I say crime numbers are rising, he interrupts me, kept interrupting, and he said, “We have it by fact that crime numbers are going down.” I said, “Anybody that thinks crime is going down is a serious brain problem.” And then it got announced the following day that Trump was right, that crime was up 45%. How about them? And I thought she was terrible at the debate. She didn’t answer any questions. All she did is tell lies, bloodbath. She talked about Charlottesville. All these things were all, I hate the word, debunked, but it says it. They were all debunked, every one of them. And people said it. Well, the radical left didn’t say it, but they’ve all been fully debunked.
(02:02:11)
All she did was tell lies. But when it came time to ask a question like, what are you going to do about inflation? What are you going to do about keeping taxes low? She was unable to even talk. But the one on Oprah was the worst one, in my opinion. Oprah wanted to climb under the table it was so embarrassing. She couldn’t answer the simplest question. So vote Trump and your incomes will soar. Your net worth will skyrocket. Your energy costs and grocery prices will come tumbling down. And we will bring back the American dream bigger, better, and stronger than ever before, the American dream. We don’t talk about the American dream anymore. You know that?
(02:02:53)
Mr. Congressman, what a great Congressman. I’m going to introduce you guys, but what a good warrior you are. Thank you. We don’t talk about the American dream anymore. We used to talk about it all the time today. They don’t talk about it. Don’t lose hope. We have to have hope. Don’t lose hope. Our country’s an embarrassment. The whole world is laughing at us. We’re going to be stronger. They weren’t laughing at us four years ago. They were not unhappy to see me head off. And they said, thank goodness, we’ll never have to see him or deal with him again. China had to pay $472 billion in tariffs. No other president took in 10 cents from China, not 10 cents. No president took in 10 cents. And remember this, and I just say this, if you look at Ukraine and Russia, but you know they say Russia. I stopped the Russian pipeline. It’s called Nord Stream II. Nobody have heard of it until I came along. I stopped the biggest economic development job, the biggest job they’ve ever done. I stopped it cold. When Biden came in, he let them build, but he killed our Keystone pipeline, which we needed. He killed Keystone. But think and remember this about Russia. Under Bush, they took a lot. Under Biden and Barack Hussein Obama. Has anyone ever heard of him? Barack Hussein. A lot of people say he’s actually running the country right now. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. But some people say he’s running our country under… I don’t think it’s Biden. Under Barack Hussein Obama, they took a lot. Under Biden, they’re taking everything. They’re taking everything.
(02:04:49)
This is Russia. They’re taking everything. I mean, Ukraine is destroyed. It’s destroyed. They could have made a deal and you didn’t even have to make a deal. Putin was never going in if I wee president. But even if, you could have made a deal. Now the whole place is destroyed. The cities are knocked down. Millions of people are dead. Far more people are dead than anybody knows. Far more people. When you see those cities get knocked down and they say two people are injured, it’s all a lot of fake news.
(02:05:20)
I’ll tell you, the people are dead. Millions of people. And now the whole place, the whole place has been… The cities have been knocked down, the whole place. They could have made a deal three years ago and everything would be happy, vibrant. Their heritage wouldn’t have been broken. Those beautiful golden towers are taken down. All of those beautiful ancient towers are rubble on the ground now. I mean, any deal they make, what’s the deal? They have to go back. They’ll take a hundred years to rebuild and you can never rebuild it like it was. That should have never happened. It would’ve never happened if I was president. And you know what? It didn’t happen. And even radical left lunatic Democrats say, I will say if Trump was president, it wouldn’t have happened. Putin would’ve never done it. I said, “Don’t do it, Vladimir. Don’t even think, we’re not going to do it, Vladimir.”
(02:06:09)
Said, “Vladimir, we’re not going to do that, Vladimir.” And China, I had the same almost identical conversation with President Xi of China. Don’t go in. Don’t go in. He’s got planes circling Taiwan. He wants that so badly. And Vladimir wanted it badly. That was the apple of his eye. Ukraine was the apple of his eye. But I said, “Don’t do it.” He would’ve never gone in, would’ve never happened. All these things would’ve never happened. But Ukraine now I see Zelensky is here. I think Zelensky is the greatest salesman in history. Every time he comes into the country, he walks away with $60 billion, billion. Walks in with $60 billion. He wants them to win this election so badly. But I would do differently. I will work out peace before I’m even… Before as president-elect, if I win this election, the first thing I’m going to do is call up Zelensky and call up President Putin. And I’m going to say, “You got to make a deal.” This is crazy, crazy.
(02:07:20)
They asked Biden, when was the last time you spoke to Putin? He didn’t know. Of course he didn’t know. What a stupid question. Of course he doesn’t know. How would he know a thing like that? But it’s been like years. Years. And they keep bombing, bombing, bombing, cities pouring down, bombing, bombing. It’s horrible. Horrible. Actually, they’re reduced now to using young boys and old men, young boys and old men because the people have been killed. So many of their people have been killed, that they are using young boys to fight the war. And old men. How about that? It’s what a horrible thing has happened just because… And it’s our fault because it’s a war

Donald Trump (02:08:00):

… war that should have never been allowed to happen and we had the power that it would never have happened. We have an incompetent leader in Biden and we have somebody who’s worse in this new one that they threw into the ring. Central to Kamala’s agenda for economic destruction is her plan to impose the largest individual tax hikes in American history onto our public, the largest small business tax hike in history, the largest capital gains tax hike in history. How about the capital gains tax, right? How about that one? And even the brand-new wealth confiscation tax or unrealized capital gain? How about that, unrealized?
(02:08:49)
I know a lot of people that are rich, but they have no cash. They’re rich as hell, but they have… What are they going to do? They have to pay cash to… Unrealized. In other words, you pay capital gains tax even though you’re not selling your property, your stock or whatever it might be. It’s never, I don’t think it’s ever even been done. It’s been thought of by communist nations, but I don’t think it’s ever been done. Her father is a fascist. He’s a Marxist and he’s a teacher of Marxist economics. What the hell are we doing? What are we doing? Where have we come? If they do, that unrealized capital gain, which I can’t believe they can pull it off, but if they do it, it will annihilate the stock market and wipe out the savings of millions of seniors and middle-class families. It’ll wipe out our country. Our country will be driven in, I think, anyway it’ll happen if…
(02:09:47)
A lot of people say the only reason the stock market size, everyone thinks I’m going to win the election. I believe that’s true. A lot of the biggest, smartest… Uncle Sam, look, it’s Uncle Sam. Uncle Sam is here. Do you agree with that? Uncle Sam says… No, a lot of people agree. I think it’s going to be horrible, we don’t win, for so many other reasons too. But you’ll have a depression like 1929. Kamala Harris is the tax queen and she’s coming for your money, she’s coming for your pensions and she’s coming for your savings unless you defeat her in November and want to take away your guns. Remember that. Always remember that. As president, I will keep Kamala’s greedy hands out of your pockets and we will deliver gigantic tax cuts. I gave you the largest tax cuts in history and we are going to go further.
(02:10:45)
That’s what created the greatest economy. When they say, “Compare yourself now,” but do something else, compare costs now, compare the cost of bacon with the cost of bacon four or five years ago. Compare the cost of just groceries. I mean, some of these things have gone up four, five, six times, energy, interest rates. How about, I was at 2% interest rates, now they’re at 10%, but you can’t get the money, so you got to keep going up, okay? You’re not at 10% if you can’t get the money. We will have… I’m very proud of this. And then she copied me on one of them, only one. I’m waiting for the others. We will have no tax on tips. That wasn’t easy. We will have no tax on overtime, you work overtime. And for our seniors who have been decimated, decimated by the stupidity of inflation. These people, what they did to you on inflation, we will have no tax on social security benefits. No tax. You’ve been decimated. They took it all away. They took it all away from you. And for all the suburban households paying high property taxes here in Pennsylvania, I will restore the SALT deduction. Do you know what that is, SALT deduction? You will, to save you thousands of dollars. Maybe I shouldn’t bother with it. That’s a good one, but you guys don’t know what the hell it is. That’s a good one. People think of New York, but it actually affects you very much too. I think I’ll keep it off of Pennsylvania. You didn’t like that one so much, but it’s actually pretty good.
(02:12:44)
It’s no wonder that Kamala Harris was just officially endorsed by IRS agents. Do you believe it? That’s one you’d say, “I’d rather not have that endorsement.” But I’ve been endorsed by virtually every police group in the entire nation. Every police group, almost every sheriff’s group, every police group, every one of them. We just had one, the fraternal order. We just had 400,000 policemen. That’s the biggest of all the unions and the endorsement. And this is the first time in decades, just got endorsed by the rank and file members of the Teamsters, which I happen to think is amazing. That was a surprise. That’s automatic for the Democrats. And now the bosses didn’t endorse me, but they had a problem because they got 30% of the vote. We got actually 60 or 61% of the vote. Can you believe it?
(02:13:53)
So the people that were in the 61, the people that want us, they said, ” Well, how come you didn’t endorse him? They’re just going to take a piss.” But maybe that’s okay, that’s all right. We know where they stand and that’s good. Kamala Harris is the candidate of the tax collectors in the Washington Bureaucrats. I am the candidate of the American worker, and I always will be. I always will be. But perhaps Kamala’s biggest tax hike of all is her vicious attack on Pennsylvania Energy. You are under attack. If anybody here believes that she will let your energy industry continue like fracking, you should immediately go to a psychiatrist and have your head examined. On dozens of occasions Kamala said that she intends to ban fracking, “I’m going to ban it. I’m going to ban it.” I think we have a clip. Would you like to see a clip? I spend a lot of money on these clips, spend a lot of money on these clips.

Kamala Harris (02:15:00):

” That’s why I am committed to passing a Green New Deal, creating clean jobs, and finally putting an end to fracking once and for all.”

Speaker 4 (02:15:12):

Mama the comma just don’t give a frack.

Donald Trump (02:15:16):

Isn’t that great? He’s not very funny. Can you… That guy. Those three guys, they’re being blown away by Gutfeld. You know Gutfeld? Totally dominant. Those three. You remember that guy when I first ran, it was like 2015, thinking about running, I was going to run. I went on his show, right? And he goes to Tonight’s Show, which is dying. They’re all dying. Where is Johnny Carson? Bring back Johnny. It made you appreciate, right Uncle Sam? It made you appreciate the greatness of Johnny Carson of these guys. These three guys, they’re so bad, all three of them. But this one, I go on his show and he goes, “Is that your real hair?” I said, “Yeah.” He said, “Do you mind if I mess it up?” I said, “I’d prefer no.” Do you remember this?

Audience (02:16:08):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (02:16:08):

I said, “I’d prefer it if you didn’t, to be honest, but if you have to.” So he grabs it and he starts really going crazy, right? And everybody laughed and it was a big thing. And it was a big hit. It was all over the place. And he got great ratings and all. And six months later, he went out because he was under pressure to apologize because he humanized Donald Trump. Do you remember? And he stood up and he said, “I’d like to apologize. Six months ago or whatever it was, I messed up Donald Trump’s hair and had humanized him and he became president, and I would like to apologize.” How weak and pathetic is a guy like that. And his show died. But the other two shows are dying. The one on ABC is dying. He was the worst host in the history of the Academy Awards. Remember I did that? Remember I wrote, I put a Truth. Everybody should go to Truth immediately. And by the way, we also love Elon, I have to tell you. Gave me a big endorsement, big one.
(02:17:14)
But remember in the Academy Awards I said how he’s the worst host in the history of the Academy Awards. And this stupid guy goes up and just before the Best Picture of the year, the show is almost over. They’re waiting for the Best Picture of the year. He gets up and his wife said, “Please don’t do it. Please, darling, don’t go out.” His manager said, “Don’t do it.” “I have to do it.” He goes out and reads my Truth to the entire audience right before prime time, the Best Picture. And it said basically, he is the worst host of the history. He reads the whole thing. And then I think he said something like, “Ha, ha, ha, he thinks he bothers me,” or some crap like that. I said, “He’s one of the dumbest human beings ever. He should have listened to his wife. What a dope.” But all three of them are bad. The hatred. It’s supposed to be comedy, it’s hatred. It’s like terrible, but they’re dying. And did anyone see the Gutfeld for last week?

Audience (02:18:12):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (02:18:18):

Actually, I said it on the show. So Gutfeld had the highest ratings in his history, and it was the number one show of the week on all of television, not just on cable, on all of television. It beat all the network shows. But I told the show, “Gutfeld hated me for a long time, hated me.” And then he started saying, “I’m starting to…” He didn’t know me, but he hated me. People that know me like me, but he just couldn’t stand me. And he was pretty strong on that. And then what happened is he started to say, “I don’t like him, but he gets everything done. He rebuilt our military. We have no wars. He took out the worst terrorists in history. We don’t have any problems.”
(02:19:04)
We didn’t have one terror attack during my administration with all the terror attacks all over the world. We didn’t have countries fighting each other. They wouldn’t have done it without my permission. They would call me up to ask whether or not they could go to war with some other country. And I say, “You can’t do that. And if you do that, I’m going to put big, big taxes all over you.” “Okay, we won’t do it.” And they call me up the next day. “We’ve decided not to-”","Indiana, Pennsylvania","2024-09-24",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Kamala Harris, the radical left Democrat politicians and the fake news media. Look how many here there are.
(00:06)
We’ve got to get our media back in this country. We got to get them back. But the message is, it’s time to stop the lies, stop the hoaxes, stop the smears, stop the lawfare or the fake lawsuits against me, and stop claiming your opponents will turn America into a dictatorship. Give me a break. Because the fact is that I’m not a threat to democracy, they are.
(01:09)
They’re doing things in politics that have never been done before in the history of our country. And worst of all, with their open borders and bad elections, they have made us into a third world nation, something which nobody thought was even possible.
(01:25)
Americans deserve a campaign based on the issues. We try and keep it on the issues. And God has now spared my life. It must have been God. Thank you. Not once, but twice. And there are those that say he did it because Trump is going to turn this state around, he’s going to turn this country around, he’s going to make America great again, and maybe.
(02:04)
And we’re going to bring back religion into our country, we’ll bring it back. These encounters with death have not broken my will, they have really given me a much bigger and stronger mission. They’ve only hardened my resolve to use my time on earth to make America great again for all Americans, to put America first, and to put America first.
(02:38)
Earlier today, I was honored to receive the endorsement of the rank and file membership of the Teamsters. I love the Teamsters. They delivered all that concrete for those buildings I built in New York. They delivered the big, heavy, most beautiful trucks you’ve ever seen. They delivered the concrete and all those buildings I built in New York. But this hasn’t happened in so many decades. We won the overwhelming majority of the local chapters and the members and as a result, the national organization has refused to endorse the Democrat candidate for the first time in many, many decades.
(03:21)
And I also want to thank Teamsters President, Sean O’Brien, an amazing man, and all of the incredible rank-and-file Teamsters across the country because this was a surprise. It’s automatic. They endorse the Democrats automatic for many, many decades, but you know what? They said, “They looked at her,” and they said, “we’re not going there. I’m sorry.” These are tough people.
(03:45)
And together we will secure our borders. We will protect our workers. We will defend our jobs. We will rebuild our country with American skill and American pride and American labor, right? And just as a little side note, we should give them a round, especially because of what and how they voted today. If they voted the other way, I wouldn’t give them around. But the Teamsters built out this beautiful stadium for tonight’s event. Thank you Teamsters. Thank you. You did a great job.
(04:25)
To every hardworking American, whether you live in a red state, a swing state, or a state with a failed Democrat rule, this year, we need to elect all Republicans up and down the ballot. We have to clean out and straighten out our country. With your vote, we are going to rescue our country, we are going to rescue our Democrat-run states. We are going to start by saving the great state of New York. Is that good? Right? Go. Right?

Crowd (04:54):

Whoa! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!

Trump (05:20):

When I told some people in Washington, “Yeah, I’m going up to New York, we’re doing a campaign speech.” They said, “What do you mean New York? You can’t ever. Nobody can win. Republicans can’t win.” I said, “I can win New York. We can win New York. We’re going to win New York.”
(05:34)
And if you vote for me, I’m going to reduce your taxes, reduce your crime, and reduce your levels of stress because you have a lot of stress. The only thing that I will increase are your incomes and your love for your state will come roaring back again.
(05:57)
Throughout American history from generation to generation, New York has always set the standard for American life and they have, it’s been a high standard too. Our cities were the center of business, arts, culture, our streets, ports, waterways. They were the arteries of American commerce. They were absolute arteries.
(06:18)
And our towns like Uniondale, Levittown, Hicksville, Huntington, these were great, great towns where you grew up and you loved and you stayed, but look at what has happened to New York and the other states all run by radical left Democrats, every single one of them.
(06:42)
Our heavy industries have exported overseas and our middle class has been eviscerated right here at home, been eviscerated. Housing costs are out of control. Inflation has cost a typical family $28,000. Think of it, in less than four years, $28, 000. And we have filthy encampments. We have horrible, disgusting, dangerous, filthy encampments of junkies and homeless people living in places that our children used to play little league baseball, which they don’t get to play very much anymore, do they?
(07:18)
Over the past three years, in New York City, there has been a 29% increase in robbery, a 36% increase in felony assault, a 42% increase in grand larceny, a 75% increase in carjackings. Did you buy a nice car lately? Well, 200 police officers leave the NYPD, New York’s finest, I always say. I knew it well. New York’s finest. They leave every single month, 200 people a month. Incredible people. They’re incredible people.
(07:54)
The trains and subways are squalid and unsafe. The median of our highway, all those medians, they spend all that money, they’re falling down, they’re rotting. Businesses are fleeing. The mobs of illegal migrants are being put up in luxury hotels at your expense while our great veterans live on the freezing or steaming sidewalks right outside the main entrance to where the migrants enter their hotel. Think of that. Think of it.
(08:23)
We have veterans lying on the street, squalid lying on the streets, sometimes freezing, sometimes it’s hot, it’s summer, and they’re looking at people come in, just came into our country and they’re going up to the 17th floor of their suite. How crazy has our country become?
(08:45)
And can you imagine what those veterans, when they watch this must be saying… But listen to this, can you also imagine what the migrants must be thinking? They’re saying, “Can you believe this? We just came from a place,” in many cases, they were in prisons and now they’re living in hotel suites while our veterans are living on the street.
(09:12)
And so, I say to the people of New York, with crime at record levels, with terrorists and criminals pouring in, and with inflation eating your hearts out, vote for Donald Trump. What the hell do you have to lose? What do you have to lose?

Crowd (09:30):

USA! USA! USA! USA!

Trump (09:30):

What do you have to lose? Think of it. What the hell do you have to lose? Some of you will remember, that was a phrase that I used for our Black population years ago in 2016. I said, “With the worst housing conditions, the worst education, the worst this, the worst that, the most crime.” I went through 12 different things and it wasn’t in the sheets, and I’m saying, “Boy, that’s really terrible. And I was at like 2%, not too good. And I said to the Black population gathered in front of me, “Vote for Trump, what the hell do you have to lose?” I said that, same thing.
(10:55)
And you know what happened? I got eviscerated when I went backstage. I went backstage, but I’m not like Biden where he takes… I fight back with my people. Remember, we still signed the check. They said, “Sir, that’s a terrible thing to have said.” I said, “What is?” “What you said, “What the hell do you have to lose?” It’s terrible. It’s demeaning. It’s horrible.” I said, “But it’s true.”
(11:18)
You know what happened? The next day, I picked up 10 points with the Black population. And now, because of all we’ve done, we’re at the highest level of Black support in the history of the Republican Party.
(11:44)
And by the way, the Hispanic support… Do we have any Hispanics? The Hispanic support is off the charts and they don’t know what the hell to do about it. It’s off the charts. And we just had some great polling come out. I think the most accurate poll over the last eight or nine years was Rasmussen. They just came out with a poll that we’re five up, we’re five up, five up. We should be 35 up to be honest with you, but some people can’t break an old habit. That’s really what it is.
(12:28)
So I say to you, vote for Trump and I will turn it around very quickly. With four more years of Kamala Harris, New York state will be like a third-world nation if it isn’t already, it is. I think it is. With Trump, the Empire State will once again be the envy of the entire world. We will have no crime, only success. And unlike your current radical Democrat regime, I’m not driven by partisan ideology, I’m driven by results and I’m driven by New York common sense. It’s common sense, right? Right? It’s common sense.
(13:13)
I like to say the party, it is is a great party. I like to say the party is, really, we’re conservative and all that, right? Who knows? You know what we are? We’re really people with common sense. We need walls. We need good elections. We want low taxes. We want great police officers that are well taken care of. We don’t want to defund the police.
(13:34)
With a party of common sense, more than anything else, and it’s picked up a lot of steam, it’s true, my first week back in the Oval Office, I will clean up and call up your governor and mayors all across your state and I will tell them, “It’s time to work together.” They’re largely Democrats. “It’s time to work together for the good of the people,” going to do it. And despite all of the persecution I’ve endured from the corrupt judicial system in New York, it’s a corrupt system, I love the people of this state and I want to give back. I want to give back to you. I’ve had a great life, I want to give back to you. We’re going to give it back to you. We’re going to make this city and we’re going to make this state incredible again.
(14:22)
Together we will rebuild our roads, bridges, highways, and airports. They’re falling apart. They’re falling down. We will renovate New York Subway. Oh, it was beautiful. I used to go to school on the subway. Can you believe it? I mean, I like to say it’s not so long ago, but it probably is. What do you think, Bruce? I guess it is.
(14:43)
But my parents would drop me off at a subway and I’d go to Union Turnpike or I’d go to wherever I… They had no fear that I was going to be disappearing. They would take me to a subway, put me on and say, “Bye darling. Bye.” If you do that today, you have about a 75% chance that you’ll never see your child again. What the hell has happened here? What has happened?
(15:11)
We will renovate the New York Subway so that the greatest city in the world finally has again the greatest transit system anywhere in the world. You have the basics. We have to clean it. We have to take care of it. We have to give it a little love. And we have to get the criminals the hell out there. We will once again support our incredible police officers, New York’s finest, a lot of them. I’ve got the support. To me, this is so important. I think to you, it’s… Every single police group in the nation is supporting me. The other day, The Fraternal Order, it’s the largest, they gave us 400,000 police and they gave us a unanimous endorsement, we have it from everybody, have it from everybody. We will work with the mayors and the governor to rebuild your defunded and depleted police forces, including New York’s finest and NYPD.
(16:23)
Look, I know so much about it. I love New York’s Finest. I used to be in Brooklyn. I had an office with my father in Brooklyn. And we used to go, in Brooklyn, to a White Castle. Did anyone ever hear of a White Castle? And my father would say, “No, that’s the best place. Only 12 cents a hamburger.” Remember 12 seconds?
(16:51)
Bruce? We had a… Bruce? How good is Bruce? Bruce Blakeman, one of the greats. He won in an upset. This was another. This is a Republican. He ran a couple of times. You couldn’t beat this hoax of Democrats. He ended up winning. He’s done such a good job, he’s now unbeatable. They don’t even run anybody against him. Great. Great. Really great.
(17:21)
I got a lot of them. Joe Cairo’s here. Joe, are we going to win, Joe? What do you think? Joe Cairo. Don’t mess with Joe, right, Joe? We love you, man. Your family’s great too.
(17:31)
But I will stop the Kamala crime wave and we will do everything we can. We’re going to get these violent criminals behind bars. We’re going to get them out of our country. We’re going to take them back to the country from which they came.
(17:49)
A few months ago, I visited with the grieving family of a New York City police officer, Jonathan Diller. You know Jonathan Diller? I was hoping his family could be with us. He was just 31 years old, gunned down during a traffic stop by a vicious thug, leaving behind his incredible wife, Stephanie and family. And family, their one-year-old son. What a son. And it’s… Are you here? Are they here? They could be here. Is-

Crowd (18:19):

[inaudible 00:18:20].

Trump (18:21):

Is Stephanie here? Because it was a bond. And she was so great. And I think she’s here. It’s hard when you have 19,000 people.

Crowd (18:39):

Yeah.

Trump (18:39):

And Stephanie, unlike a lot of my friends, doesn’t want adulation. Honestly, what she wants more than… she wants her husband back. That’s what she wants. She doesn’t want adulation. I have other friends, you’d find them, I have other friends if you said their name, they’d be jumping up, “Here I am. Here I am.” Stephanie doesn’t want that. What a great family. What a great family. And what a great guy he was.
(19:06)
The criminal charged with savagely murdering Officer Diller was previously arrested by the NYPD 21 times, right? 21 times, Bruce. And the accomplice driving the car had been arrested 14 times, but he was actually much worse, he was more vicious. 14 times, but he was actually far more vicious.
(19:28)
This is the kind of story we hear every single day under radical Democrat policies like cashless bail, cashless bail. You kill somebody and you’re out on the streets in two hours. Cashless bail has been a disaster for our country. Kamala Harris wanted it no matter where she went. She boasted about being the leader of the movement of cashless bail, just like she led the effort to defund the police. She was the leader of the effort to defund the police, and now she’s running for president.
(20:02)
But a little while ago, a little while ago, like everything else, no fracking, no this, she changed her mind. Now she says she likes the police. She can’t say love, but she says like. She’s made a lot of progress, but you know the first thing that would happen is she will go to defunding the police if that’s even possible to think about.
(20:28)
But when I get back into the Oval Office, the madness ends and the law and order is going to return to our country. A fully reformed Federal Department of Justice will deliver massive public safety funding for New York and other Democrat-run cities that are under siege. But in exchange, they will give our police back their protection and their respect. We are going to take care of our police and we’re going to respect our police, everyone here does.
(21:03)
I tell the officers all the time, “You have no idea how the people love you, but sometimes they don’t feel it because of what the Democrats do to them, they will end deadly sanctuary city policies. They will terminate cashless bail. And they will return to proven policing methods like we had under Mayor Rudy Giuliani that made New York City the safest big city in America. Simultaneously, we are going to make life in New York state affordable again. Little word, affordable. A vote for Kamala Harris is a vote for four more years of job losses. Look at what’s happening, businesses that are fleeing, money draining out of your state, and hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants sucking your public resources dry. I’ve always heard, for 20 years, I’ve heard that New York City has no money, and yet they’re going to spend 3 billion on illegal migrants. And they’re not getting it from the federal government. You wonder, they never had money, but they have $3 billion to take care of people that came into our country illegally. Doesn’t make sense.
(22:18)
But under the Trump Economic Plan, we will cut your energy prices in half within 12 months, half because we have more liquid gold under our feet and we don’t use it. We go to places like Venezuela when we have more than Russia, we have more than Saudi Arabia. You remember, I got ANWR approved in Alaska. It’s the biggest site anywhere in the world, probably bigger than Saudi Arabia, bigger than Russia.
(22:47)
And what did they do? In the first week in office, Ronald Reagan tried so hard, he couldn’t get it, I got it. The biggest site in the world, Alaska. And in the first week in office, they terminated it. We’ll have it back very quickly, I promise you that.
(23:10)
We will rapidly defeat inflation. We’re going to bring your prices down. All they’re doing is they’ve cut it, but you’re up 55 or 60%. People that used to live a nice life four years ago, they can’t afford an apple.
(23:25)
They showed a picture of a woman the other day. I said, “Boy, that’s sad. That should never happen to her.” She went to the counter, the cashier, she had three apples, and when she was standing with the cashier, she realized she didn’t have enough money for one of the apples, and she took the apple, brought it back, and she bought two apples. That shouldn’t be happening in our country. That shouldn’t be happening in our country.
(23:48)
We will cut interest rates, cut insurance costs. And insurance is horrible. And massively, we will cut your taxes again. I gave you the largest tax cut in the history of

Trump (24:00):

… of our country, and we have some to go. Kamala Harris, as you look at her plan, will give you very simply the largest tax hike in American history. She’s going to lift your taxes. This is the only person I’ve ever seen, and Biden too, they announce that they’re going to raise your taxes and it’s supposed to be good politically. I don’t think so. I don’t know. I’ve never seen that Anthony before where they say they’re going to raise your taxes, they’re going to raise your taxes. Vote for me, I’m going to raise your taxes. Can you believe it? I made a mistake. I shouldn’t have done that because the news will say, vote for me, I’m going to raise your… They’re going to say… They’re going to attribute it to me. I can’t do that.
(24:46)
I told our great First Lady, I will not be sarcastic anymore. When you joke or when you’re sarcastic, the fake news will take a story like that. I’ll say, I never said I was going to raise your taxes. Vote for me, I’ll raise your taxes. Kiddingly, kiddingly, kiddingly. These people are the worst. When I imitated Joe Biden because he couldn’t get off a stage, so I’d imitate him because he couldn’t find the stairs and look around. He finished the speech which the speech would last maybe three minutes, maybe a little less than that. Then he’d want to get off the stage. I’d always remember, he’d always go like this, but remember, we’re not running against him, we’re running against somebody who’s actually much worse. Ready. He’d go like this, and then he’d walk in a different direction. It was the weirdest thing.
(25:40)
Secret Service did a great job. They’d come up in the stage and they’d pull them out. Like today we have four or five stairs. You always have four or five, six stairs. It’s government-owned, the more stairs you have. But you always have a lot. So I said to our great First Lady who can draw a crowd. Did you watch me tonight on television First Lady? People love our First Lady, I tell you. Go out and get her book. She just wrote a book. I hope she said good things about… I don’t know. I didn’t… So busy. She just wrote a book called Melania. I go out and buy it. It’s great.
(26:20)
If she says bad things about me, I’ll call you all up and I’ll say, don’t buy it. Get rid of it. No, but she said to me, I said, “Baby, did you see the crowd? We had 18,000 people. We could have filled it up three or four times.” Bruce Blakeman said to me, “If we went to a stadium or a park, we would’ve had a 100,000 people or more.” So I’d call up my wife and I’d say, “Baby, who could draw crowds? Nobody can draw crowds like me. Nobody. Not even close.”
(26:58)
I’m the greatest of all time. Maybe greater even than Elvis because Elvis had a guitar. I don’t have a guitar. Elvis had a guitar. I don’t have the privilege of a guitar, but I’d say, “Baby, who could do it like me? Nobody can do it like me. How great am I?” I’d say, “How great was the speech?” Not how good. How great was it? She’d say, “It was good, but your hair looked terrible tonight.” Or, the worst ever. So I said, how good was it First Lady? She said, “It was good, but you couldn’t find your way off the stage.” I was imitating Biden and they said, I did it. I couldn’t find my way off the stage. No. So you can’t be sarcastic. Sarcasm with the media doesn’t work. Okay. It doesn’t. So I’ve given up about 90% of it.
(28:10)
I got all my friends here, Anthony. Anthony, stand up. Anthony Lomangino, one of the greats of all time. He said, “I have a big business problem.” “What?” “I have too much cash. I don’t know what to do with it.” I said, “I’ve heard of worse problems than that, Anthony.” Right? He’s doing good. He’s a great man, a great businessman and a great person. Kamala wants income tax hikes, small business tax hikes, capital gains tax hike. How about the capital gains? She wants a tax, unrealized capital gain. That means she wants to give you a capital gain. Even if you have stock, she wants to give you a capital gain even if you didn’t sell it. I know a lot of people, they’re very rich, but they don’t have cash. They’re rich, but they don’t have cash. A lot of them.
(29:05)
Do you know who is like that? Farmers are like that. They have great land, great everything. They make income, but they don’t have cash. You know what I did for farmers in small business, in the tax hike, nobody talks about this. I got rid of the estate tax, or the death tax as they would call it. So that when you die and you pass it on to your children who you love, if you don’t love your children, then it’s not going to do you any good. There are those. Does anybody in this incredible arena… They did a nice job, by the way, of fixing it. I remember the old one. Does anybody in this incredible arena not love their children? Who in the arena is rich and will not leave their money to their kids? Because if that’s the case, then what they did for you, doesn’t mean anything. Do I have any hands? 20,000 people and I have no hands.
(29:55)
Who wants to leave their kids? That’s good. Well, in the old days, you’d leave the money to the kids and what would happen? The kids would have to go out and borrow money. They’d lose everything. They had to borrow money from a bank at a high rate of interest. Now they don’t have to do that anymore. Now you can leave your farm, you can leave your small business to your kids. But Kamala wants to end that. She wants to end it. She wants to raise your tax to a level that nobody’s ever heard of before. It’s crazy. We will go in to a… I thought this was a wise guy coming up. This guy. I thought, I’m getting ready. I’m going like this. I got a little bit of a [inaudible 00:30:40] problem here, right? That was amazing. I was already to start duking it out. I felt like my man in the front row here.
(30:50)
Stand up, will you please? This is the toughest man. You know him? Do you all know. I’m going to introduce you later so you can see. He’s that toughest guy. If somebody walked on the stage, he wouldn’t be afraid. He would already be attacking the poor guy. Yeah, that was interesting, wasn’t it? The first time that’s ever happened, I think. Is he new to the game? I think so.
(31:13)
By contrast, I will cut taxes for families, small businesses and workers, including restoring the salt deduction, saving thousands of dollars for residents of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and other high-cost states. Going to restore salt jobs and factories will pour back into New York. I know how to do it better than anybody’s ever known how to do it. We can do it so easily. Wages will soar. The cost of living will fall, and I will deliver the greatest economy in the history of the world to our country and one of the greatest economies in the history of New York state. A key part of restoring safety and saving our economy is stopping the invasion at the border of our country. It’s crazy. Under border czar, Kamala Harris, she was the border czar until she started looking at this situation, until the coup, I say until the coup because it was a coup. But she was a border czar. Now she said I was never the border czar. You know what? Give her that. But she was in charge of the border and the border is the worst-run border in the history of the world. There’s never been a border like this. 21 million people, illegal aliens, are coming in from all over the world, from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums. Many tourists are coming in just to watch. Did you ever see this? You have tourists that line up to take pictures of it. They usually turn out to be the fake news.
(33:04)
The pictures are so bad they never show it. The fake news never ever talks about it. But we have massive numbers of terrorists coming in to our country. You have everybody coming in. We have people that can’t speak the language. The great Tom Homan told me the other day, great guy, central casting guy, great guy. He told me the other day, last month, they figured it out for the last 12 months, 168 different countries came in, represented and came into our country. Most people don’t even know you have that many countries. You actually have over 200, but most people don’t know.
(33:44)
But I want to be known as one thing. In 2016, I probably won because of the border. I did a great job and the border was good. In 2020, even though I got millions and millions more votes, they said, sir, you get the same number of votes as you did in 2016, 63 million. Sir, you cannot lose. I got millions more and I lost. But you know what? We’re going to have the greatest win in history when we pull this one off. It’ll be legendary. But in 2020, my people would say, sir, it doesn’t help for you to speak about the border. Nobody cares. I said, I want to speak about the border. I did a great job. Sir, nobody cares. It’s true. I talk about the border, nobody cared. But now they care because now the border is 25 times worse than it was in 2016. Now the border is not even believable what’s happening. I want to be known as your border president. I’m going to be known as your border president.
(35:14)
Kamala will be known as your invasion president. Just let them all come in. Let them all come in. No. We got to save our country. Our country’s going down. If you look at what’s happening with the Venezuelans taking over, they’re taking over large pieces of real estate in Colorado. You have a Democrat governor who’s petrified of them. He’s afraid. I’d never seen anything like it. He doesn’t want to talk about it. They’ve taken over your buildings and your land. You got to do something about it. That wouldn’t happen with Bruce Blakeman, I can tell you right now. Bruce, would you let people come in from a foreign country like Venezuela where, by the way, their crime rate is down 72% because they’ve taken their prisoners, they’ve taken their gangs, they’ve taken their drug dealers, and they’ve shipped them all to the United States. So their crime rate’s down.
(36:17)
But Bruce, would you ever tell the people that you’re supposed to be protecting when they call? A lot of Venezuelans are in here and they have very big guns. Would you say, listen, I don’t really want to do anything about it. Would you do that or would you say, don’t worry, we’ll have a force of people over there within minutes and it would all be over, right? Right. I think so. No, he wouldn’t play games. He wouldn’t play games.
(36:46)
But these people, the law enforcement, they’re afraid in these places because it’s so violent. They’ve never seen people like this. These are violent people that they’re allowing into our country. It is truly an invasion. We’re not going to let it happen. We’re going to take those violent people and we’re going to ship them back to their country. If they come back in, they’re going to pay a hell of a price. Thank you. We have no choice. We have no choice. This is not sustainable by any country. This is not sustainable. How about in Springfield, Ohio? They had 32,000… This is a little beautiful town. No crime, no problem. 32,000 illegal immigrants come into the town. 32,000. So they almost doubled their population in a period of a few weeks. Can you believe it? You know what? They’ve got to get much tougher. I’m going to go there in the next two weeks. I’m going to Springfield and I’m going to Aurora. You may never see me again, but that’s okay. Got to do what I got to do. Whatever happened to Trump? Well, he never got out of Springfield. I’m leading in Ohio by like 15 points, a lot. We’re going to take care of Ohio and we’re going to take care of Colorado and we’re going to take care of every single state in the union. They’re all under siege. A lot of people don’t talk about…
(38:29)
But think of this. So the mayor of Springfield –, and I think he’s a very nice person, but instead of saying, we’re getting them all out, we are getting them out, he says, very simply, we’re hiring teachers to teach them English. Can you believe it? We are hiring interpreters. So when they go to school and take the of our children in school, we have an interpreter. Each one will have a private interpreter. What the hell is wrong with our country? No. We are getting them out of our country. They came in illegally. They’re destroying our country. We’re getting them out. They’re going to be brought back to the country from which they came. I will protect our country. I will protect our country.
(39:18)
Think of it. She will surrender our country. That’s what they’re doing. They still refuse to acknowledge that these people have to be taken out. You start with the stone-cold killers, the murderers, the drug dealers. You get them out and you tell them if they ever come back, big trouble. But let me tell you what you really do. Some of them are so bad you can’t take the chance of sending them out because they’ll come back. You lock them up and it’s going to be there for a long time. When they know that, you’ll see a whole big difference. As you know here on Long Island, the open borders policies of Kamala Harris and were really her policies that the Communist left, I call it the Communist left, have been importing MS-13 gang members by the thousands. I don’t know what it is about Long Island, but I took thousands and thousands of gang members out. Do you remember the story?
(40:15)
Remember, I came into the presidency and MS-13 was on my mind because I saw that in Long Island, two beautiful young girls were walking to school. They were 16 years old. An MS-13 gang of deviants grabbed the girls and sliced them up into pieces, not with guns. They didn’t want guns. They killed the two girls. They sliced them into little pieces. I never forgot that. Then I found out that things like that are happening all over wherever they are. MS-13, the worst gang anywhere. The only thing good about that is they make our gangs look like very nice people. I want to tell you, these are the worst people. They’re animals. Nancy Pelosi said you shouldn’t call people animals. That’s not appropriate. They’re animals. That’s the philosophy.
(41:07)
I got to the White House and I said, they have a lot in Ohio, a lot in every state. I said, I want MS-13 out of here. They come from various places, a little bit south of Mexico. They come from Mexico too. I said, what I want you to do is I want to bring him out. A general said, sir, I’m sorry, sir. The countries will not under any circumstances allow us to bring them back in. They don’t want them anymore, sir. I said, how long has this been going on? Many years during the Barack Hussein Obama. Has anyone ever heard of him? Many years, sir. Under the Barack Hussein Obama administration. It’s been going on for years. So they won’t take them.
(41:47)
You know what they do? They would take Honduras. Okay. Think of it. They would take planes and they would put them on the runways. They would put the planes, El Salvador, or different countries. Some of the roughest gangs, they put big commercial aircraft. So when a plane is going to fly in with 200 or 300 MS-13 killers, you couldn’t land the plane. They said, sir, we can’t get them back. All of the bus routes are blocked. We can’t get the buses in. When they know a plane is coming, they put planes on the runway. Sir, we won’t be able to do it. I said, I think you will. How much money do we pay them for economic development of the dictator’s house? How much money do we pay them, General? I’ll get back to you, sir. He comes back the next day, sir, we pay them $750 million a year. It’s a lot. Let me tell you it’s peanuts compared to some of the money that we pay, but it’s a lot of money. I said, inform these countries that under no circumstances are they getting any money anymore. They’re not getting any money. They are delinquent. They’re not allowing us to bring back people that they forced into our country through caravans. So they inform them. The next day I get to the Oval Office nice and early, and I get calls from three particular countries separately. Sir, there seems to be a problem or a misunderstanding. I said, yeah, there is a misunderstanding. You’re not taking your MS-13 people that you sent into our country. You’re not taking them back. I’m going to not give any money to your country forever. You’re never getting 10 cents.
(43:26)
In all cases, they said something to the effect, sir, it is so bad that I didn’t know about this. I wish I would’ve known about it. We would love to take MS-13 back into our country. We love them very much. We will take them back, sir. That day, that afternoon, we started bringing them out of our country by the thousands and thousands and thousands. The worst part of the story is, now, I still didn’t pay them. I think it would. But now they’re getting $4 billion a year under Biden. Biden said, do it. Maybe she knew about it. I don’t want to blame her if she didn’t. But $4 billion. You know why? Because he wants them to create a beautiful environment so that they say that that’s not going to happen. Okay? The money’s going to be stolen all over the place. So instead of $750 million, it’s now at $4 billion.
(44:24)
An estimated 75% of arrests in Midtown Manhattan and over 60% of arrests in Queens are now illegal aliens. Congratulations. Congratulations. You know this. In Queens a few months ago, an illegal alien released by Kamala Harris, she was in charge of the border, approached two thirteen-year-old children with a machete in broad daylight, forced them into the woods, tied them together by the wrists and raped them. Injured them terribly, very badly. You know about it. In the Bronx, another illegal alien that Kamala Harris set loose into our country, approached a 36-year-old woman, while pretending to ask for directions. Ma’am, he said, I’d like directions to someplace before he wrapped his arms around her throat, pinned her down on a park bench and raped her all night and beat the hell out of her. You know what she said? She said, he didn’t rape me. He tried to kill me. That was her expression when the police came.
(45:35)
And on Coney Island, a place I know well, just weeks ago, two migrants Kamala let in raped a 46-year-old woman with a knife to her throat. She was badly, badly beaten, probably going to live. For every New Yorker being terrorized by this wave of migrant crime. I’ve been talking about migrant crime for five years. I said, if you let them in, it’s going to be hell. They are vicious, violent criminals that are being led into our country. They’re people that their countries, who are very smart, they don’t want them. That’s why all over the world, a lot of people coming from jails out of the Congo in Africa, where do you come from? The Congo. Where in the Congo? We come from jail. What did you do? We will not tell you. They’re coming from the Congo. They’re coming from Africa. They’re coming from the Middle East. They’re coming from all over the world. Asia. A lot of it coming from Asia.
(46:34)
What’s happening to our country is we’re just destroying the fabric of life in our country. We’re not going to take it any longer. You got to get rid of these people. Give me a shot. You will have a safe New York within three months. Three months. For every New Yorker being terrorized by this wave of migrant crime, November 5th will be your liberation day. It’s going to be liberation because you are living like hell. You’re living a life like hell. I will launch a special task force of elite federal law enforcement people, many of whom I already know that are tough, and charge them with crushing the MS-13 remnants. The problem is I got them out and now they come back in. They just walk back in like there’s nothing to it. But eliminating MS-13 and every foreign gang and organized criminal network opening up on American soil. They’re coming in by the millions, not by the hundreds, they’re coming in by the millions.
(47:43)
Think of it, probably 21 million people. That’s probably a low number. We can do all of this and more, but patriotic New Yorkers must get your asses out to vote. Got to get up. Get out. Harry,

Trump (48:00):

Harry, get up. Harry. Harry, get your fat ass out of the couch. You’re going to vote for Trump today, Harry. Get up, Harry. Come on, let’s go. Let’s go, Harry.
(48:20)
We’ve got to vote. Got to vote. And I believe we have the vote. You know, it’s an interesting thing. Evangelical Christians, they tend not to vote very much. If they did, you’d never lose. Gun owners, I have the total endorsement of the NRA. Have had it from the beginning. Gun owners don’t vote, meaning they don’t vote in a proportion that they should. Very small numbers vote. It’s probably rebellion. Who knows what it is? The gun owners have to get out and vote. Evangelicals, Christians have to get out and vote. People have to get out. There are some groups that don’t vote like they should and we’re going to win.
(48:59)
We’re pleased to be joined tonight by members of Congress that are really terrific, that are warriors, really warriors. And one of them in particular. I love what she did to that woman at Harvard. Oh, that was not pretty. Elise Stefanik, where is Elise? Where is she? Where is she? She is so great. Where the hell is she? Thank you, Elise. Boy, she was great.
(49:26)
Mark Molinaro, great. Nick LaLota. Nick? Thank you, Nick. Great job. He’s doing a good job. Here’s has another one doing a good job, I gave him a big endorsement. Anthony D’Esposito. He’s doing a great job. Thank you, Anthony. Salt, salt Anthony. Remember fellas, salt. Brandon Williams is doing great. Thank you, Brandon. Thank you very much. Nick Langworthy, terrific guy. Claudia Tenney. Where’s Claudia? Where’s Claudia? She’s been amazing. Congressional candidate, Mike LiPetri. Where’s Mike? Thank you, Mike. Good. I heard you’re leading big.
(50:18)
And Allison Esposito, she’s a tough one. Allison, thank you. Thank you very much. It’s tough when you have this many people. I’m looking around. Where’s one person? Thank you very much, Allison. Beautiful. Senate candidate. Mike Sapriacone. Mike Sapriacone. Come on, Mike. Where’s Mike? You’ve got to win Mike. We got to win that one, Mike. You could do that. You could do that.
(50:46)
A former senator and a friend of mine for a long time and we had disputes every once in a while, but generally I would say it was a 10 relationship and he was a tough cookie, Senator Al D’Amato, right? Good man. A good man, a great lawyer and congressman, and he helped me a lot during impeachment hoax number one and impeachment hoax number two. They were hoaxes.
(51:14)
Congressman Lee Zeldin. He’s great, and he’s a big part of our campaign and I want to bring him to Washington with us. He’s a great lawyer. Get ready. Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, who’s fantastic. A mayor who was a fantastic mayor, very shy kind of a guy. He took crime. It was terrible. It was at a level that was as bad as today and he made New York the safest big city in the world, Rudy Giuliani. Boy, Rudy, isn’t that great? And his son, who happens to be a great golfer, a lot of people say, “Oh, how’s Andrew?” “Not that good.” Let me tell you, he’s seriously good. Andrew Giuliani, thank you. Andrew. Thank you, Andrew doing a good job.
(52:43)
And a very beautiful little boy who went through hell. But I brought him some presents. That’s why I was late for you today. I brought him presents. I said, “Liam, do you think the crowd of 20,000 plus a lot of people outside,” we put up big televisions on the back of the building, but that’s not like being here. It’s wonderful. Hello out there. I hope you’re enjoying it. Big, big, beautiful screens. We have big screens, not quite like being in the third row, first row. But Liam LaCastro is here and he is a great young man. He’s gone through a lot, but he’s going to be better soon. Right, Liam? And I got him the most beautiful presents. He’s a great boy, great parents, beautiful sister.
(53:37)
Also with us are members of New York City, Firefighters Union, Local 94, the largest in the city. Thank you, fellas. Incredible people. And in their honor I’m … And I think this is a big deal. Because in your honor, I am announcing tonight that as President I will make the ground zero sight at the World Trade Center, a national monument protected and maintained by the United States government, so that hallowed ground and the memory of those who perished there will be preserved for all time, preserved forever. And you deserve it. A lot of great people. I met him last week. Thank you. Thank you. Well, and I met him last week with the ceremony and it was a beautiful ceremony and met a lot of fan fantastic people. The New Yorkers who created the 9/11 National Memorial Museum really did an amazing job, didn’t they? And many of them are here today and I want to thank them. And I want to ensure that their outstanding work is sustained forever. And that’s what we’ve done by doing this.
(54:59)
So we are just 48 days away from the most important election in American history. The most important. The most. Stand up, just now you can stand up. They didn’t put your name down. Turn around. Who is he? Name him. He took care of business, right? It’s my man. Good. Boy, I’m glad I didn’t forget you. Good guy. Good friend of mine for a long time. Whenever I had problems they’d look at him and they’d say, “Let’s leave Trump alone.” Thank you, man. Thank you. We appreciate it. Great, great gentleman.
(55:39)
Kamala Harris is for wide open borders with terrorists and criminals pouring into our country, more inflation, even higher than the last four years, which was a record. She wants to pack the Supreme Court. Think of that one. And today I heard it all, I thought they wanted maybe 11, maybe they wanted 13. That’s an unlucky number. So maybe it would be 15 instead of nine. But instead of nine, Kamala wants to bring up potentially as many as 25 justices so that they can rig the system like they rig everything else, including elections.
(56:21)
And maybe one of the worst things of all, she’s a true believer. And again, I said this before, if you wanted to defund the police, if you’ve been there even for a day in your mind, you want to defund the police, even for one day, you are not qualified to be the President of the United States. Because anybody who wants to defund the police, we can’t have it. We can’t have it. It’ll go down. It’ll go down. We’re not going to let our country fail. It’s too great. And you know what? If we don’t win this election, it’s very possible. We’ll never have another chance. We have to do it. You have to get out. You have to vote.
(57:04)
But Kamala vowed to abolish ICE. She supports free healthcare for illegal aliens. How about that one? You don’t get free healthcare. These are all things that she would for years. Now for the last little while she’s saying, “No, I don’t really think I thought was right anymore.” 15 different things. She wants mass amnesty and citizenship for all illegals, which means totally bankrupting Social Security and Medicare. She wants to put illegal aliens into your Social Security and your Medicare system, which guarantees their bankruptcy. She says, “We must not utter the words illegal alien again or radical Islamic terrorist again.”
(57:50)
And think of this during her three-and-a-half years, to me, this is the worst thing I talk about tonight. It’s unbelievable. During her period of three and a half years, she was in charge of the border, she lost more than 325,000 migrant children, many of whom have been trafficked, raped, and many of whom are dead, many of whom are dead. Think of what that is. That’s like Yankee Stadium filled up many, many times. Think of it, think of it.
(58:25)
As California Attorney General, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon and rape of an unconscious person. I’d never heard of this. Rape of a very unconscious person as totally nonviolent crimes. She vowed repeatedly to ban fracking. She imposed a natural gas export ban that is crushing the state of Pennsylvania. I’m way up in Pennsylvania, by the way. This helps, because she’s not going to let. You know, the day after the election, all of these things come back. I hope you know that. She praised the idea of a tax rate of between 70% and 80%. And her only idea for solving inflation is to impose communist-inspired price controls, which have never worked.
(59:17)
She pledged to abolish … Does anybody here of private healthcare? You worked hard? She wants to abolish anybody that’s worked hard and made some money, private healthcare, no more private health care and force everyone into a socialist government-run healthcare with high taxes and deadly wait times. And she even endorsed free sex change operations for illegal aliens in detention, all at taxpayer expense. Now, think of that one. They come into the country illegally and they say, “I want to change my sex.” “Oh, that’s okay.” She’s totally in favor of it. I’m sure she’ll deny it now, but that’s what she is.
(01:00:04)
In 2021, Joe Biden tasked Kamala Harris with bringing broadband to rural America. Rural America was dying for it, and gave her $42 billion to do the job. Three years later, right now, not a single home has been connected to broadband. Everyone’s saying, “What happened to the money?” $42 billion, not one home. And in the Midwest, you read this, in the Midwest, they built eight charging stations. That’s like a gas pump with electricity, right? Eight. They spent $9 billion to build eight charging stations. Other than that, it really works well. I will end the electric mandate on cars immediately.
(01:00:51)
And I have to say this, look, Elon Musk is great. He’s a great guy and he makes a great car. And as strong as I am of this, because I think they’re incredible, but it’s limited. Some people want him and some people love them. I think they’re incredible and he makes a great product. Maybe the best product I hear. And he understands this. Some people have to go far distances. Some people don’t want the additional cost. Some people don’t want their car built in China. Electric cars will be built in China. I’m going to bring back the auto industry. We’re going to have gasoline- powered cars, we’re going to have hybrids, we’re going to have electric cars, we’re going to have everything. The new one is hydrogen. I heard about that the other day, hydrogen. There’s one little problem: if it blows up, you’re dead. It’s great until one day there’s a little bit of a problem, Anthony, and it blows up. And when that happens, it’s not a pretty picture. So I think I’ll take a pass on that one, if you don’t mind for a while.
(01:01:58)
And yesterday, three agencies of the Kamala Harris and Joe Biden administration, the FBI, the office of the Director of National Intelligence, and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, they just released a report confirming that Iran actors hacked into the Trump campaign’s email accounts, and in turn sought to give the hacked materials to the Biden-Harris campaign. They gave them all of the materials because Biden is working with Iran. And Iran doesn’t exactly like me because they were ready to make a deal, except we had an election that was rigged and stolen. And look at what’s happening to our world now.
(01:02:43)
But no, Iran hacked into my campaign. I don’t know what the hell they found. I’d like to find out. Couldn’t have been too exciting. But they gave to the Biden campaign. I can’t believe it. Oh, yes, I can. But this is really foreign election interference. This is real election interference. Not the phony crap that they’ve been trying to pin on me with Russia, Russia, Russia for years. Whatever happened to Russia, Russia, Russia? Remember the 51 intelligence agents? They said, “No, no, the laptop from hell, it’s Russia.” No, it was Hunter. It was Hunter. Remember that? We had to go two-and-a-half years. And then they finally said, “All right,” the Mueller, remember Mueller? He said, in millions of phone calls, Trump didn’t make one to Russia. They went through every phone call I made. Can you imagine? In millions of calls, not one call to … And a lot of people apologized for that, but not enough people apologized. They wasted time and money. They spent hundreds of millions of dollars going after me, and they got nothing. They got nothing. But we cannot allow this insanity to continue anymore. That’s why less than two months from now, we are going to tell Kamala that we’ve had enough. Kamala, you’ve been a terrible vice president. You will be an even worse president. We’re not going to take it anymore, Kamala. Kamala, you are fired. Get out. You are fired. We are not going to take it anymore, Kamala.
(01:04:54)
That was a little line from The Apprentice, which I’m sure you haven’t seen. What a great show. Was The Apprentice good or what? From the moment we take back the White House from Kamala Harris, I believe we are going to have the four greatest years in the history of our country. Starting on day one, I will seal the border and stop the migrant invasion. — an invasion like no country has ever seen before. We will stop it immediately. We will carry out the largest deportation operation of criminals in American history. We’re getting them out of our country.
(01:05:39)
We will make America the dominant energy producer in the world by far. We have more than anybody else. And we have literally, we have more, think of it, we have more than Saudi Arabia. We have more than anybody else, especially when you add ANWR in Alaska, which we will reinstitute immediately. We’re going to use it, along with growth. We are going to grow, grow, grow, to start paying down our debt. We have $35 trillion in national debt. We are all set to do it. And then we got hit by COVID. We had to focus on that, and then we gave back …
(01:06:12)
I got great marks on the military. We took out ISIS, wiped out ISIS 100%. We did it in four weeks. It was supposed to take four years, five years. And I got great marks in the economy. Never got great marks on COVID because they didn’t want to give them to me. But the fact is, we did an unbelievable job. Nobody knew what the hell it was. It came from China, it came from the Wuhan lab. I said all these things, and we did an unbelievable job. And we handed over a country whose stock market was higher than it was just prior to COVID coming in, and amazing. But we did have to focus on that. Think of what China did to us. The world has $60 trillion, and millions and millions of people dead over that disaster. Think of that. The whole world. Even China suffered very much. They suffered at the end more than almost anybody.
(01:07:14)
I will turn the United States into a manufacturing superpower more than it has ever been before. We’re going to bring back the car industry. We’re going to bring back the car industry. Other countries that make us pay a tax to do business with them will be charged the same tax when they send their product into the United States. We have countries, not only China, many, many countries, many of them are allies. Some of the worst trading countries are allies. Don’t let that word surprise you. They’re allies, they’re friends of ours, and they take advantage of us horribly on the military with NATO and on trade. It will be called the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act. And if China or any other country charges us a 200, or 100, or 300% percent tax, then we will charge them a like 100, 200, 300% tax in return. You charge us, we charge you.
(01:08:21)
And my message is very simple. Make your product right here in Uniondale, make your product in America. Make your product in America and only in America. And if you do that, Bruce, you won’t have to pay a tax. And they’ll be coming in here like you wouldn’t believe. The worst that happens, we’ll take it a lot of money, but we don’t even want that. We want them to make their product. We’re going to bring back the auto industry. Right now, China’s building some of the largest auto plants in the world and they’re building them in Mexico. And they think they’re going to build these massive plants, literally the biggest in the world, they’re going to make millions of cars and sell them without tax across our border. We will put a tariff on all of those cars to a point where they won’t be able to sell them because we want them to build their plants in the United States and hire many of the people in this audience, and that’s what’s going to happen.
(01:09:16)
And we also have something that’s basic, but wow. People said, “You’re really smart. Where the hell did you think of this one?” No tax on tips. So if you’re a waitress, a caddy, a driver. But maybe better, no tax on overtime. And we’ll get it done. We’ll get it done. Unlike him with student loan debt that went nowhere just to talk. I get it all done. Remember what they say: promises made, promises kept. That’s me.
(01:10:04)
And ready? For the seniors. Do we have any seniors in the audience? Raise your hand. You ready? No tax on Social Security benefits. No tax on Social Security benefits. And you know why you deserve it? Because you lived like hell with the highest inflation probably in the history of our country, and you couldn’t make ends meet. Now you’re not going to have to pay tax on your Social Security benefits. And I will always protect Social Security and Medicare. And they won’t. They’re going to destroy it. They’re putting the migrants all over the place, including there. And while working Americans catch up, we’re going to put a temporary cap on credit card interest rates. We’re going to cap it at around 10%. We can’t let them make 25% and 30%.
(01:11:07)
We will terminate the green new Scam and spend trillions of dollars. We’re going to take the green new Scam, one of the greatest scams in the history of our country. Remember when they used to say global warming? They don’t say that anymore. They say climate change because the planet’s actually getting cooler. Climate change, Chuck, climate change is different. Just Chuck Zito. Oh, I feel safe with him in the front row. Are you afraid of climate change, Chuck? Because now it’s no longer global warming because that wasn’t working so well because it was getting cooler. Now it’s climate change because that covers, if it’s warmer, it’s cooler. We’re going to take all of that money. We are going to take it and we’re going to rebuild … We’re going to take this money

Trump (01:12:00):

…from the Green New Scam… It’s a Green New Scam, one of the greatest scams in history. And we’re going to spend it on roads and bridges and real infrastructure and we’re going to pay down debt. Not fake infrastructure that’s caused massive inflation and has no benefit whatsoever for our country. And I will settle the war in Ukraine. I got along very well with Putin and Zelenskyy. And I will end the chaos in the Middle East. A vote for Kamala Harris is a vote to obliterate Israel. That’s what’s going to happen. Israel will not exist in two years. And by the way, we are closer to World War III right now than at any time during anybody’s life in this beautiful room. I will stand with Israel and we will return a thing called peace through strength. And we’re going to get it settled. We’re going to get it done.
(01:13:07)
We’re going to get it done. We’re not going to have war in the Middle East. We’re not going to have war with Russia and Ukraine. You know, when I was there, we didn’t have any war other than ISIS. I finished them off. We knocked out al-Baghdadi, the founder of ISIS. Think of that. We knocked them off. It was supposed to take four to five years. I did it in four weeks. General Raisin’ Caine. “What’s your name?” “Caine, sir.” “What’s your first name?” “Well, they call me ‘Raisin’.” I said, Your name is Raisin’ Caine.” That’s the general I was looking. He did it in four weeks. The Russian attack on Ukraine and the October 7th attack on Israel would never have happened if I was president. Would never have happened.
(01:13:49)
Think of what the world would be and think of what our nation would be with no Russia-Ukraine war. No October 7th disaster in Israel and the Middle East. It was just as inflamed. Right now it’s inflamed like nobody’s seen it for 50 years. No inflation. And energy dominance. That’s what we would have, energy dominance. We’d have no inflation. We wouldn’t have either the Middle East or the Russia-Ukraine. What a different world it would be, wouldn’t it be?
(01:14:21)
We can’t let them cheat on elections anymore. We can’t let it out. We will rebuild our cities, including Washington, DC. Making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. Right now we have a capital that when you go down there, you have a damn good chance of being hurt, mugged, something.
(01:14:38)
And we will keep the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. We’re losing that, but I’ll keep it. I’ll keep it. China wants to take it over. And if that happened to us, that would be like losing a war. That would be the biggest thing. That would make us a Third World country. We will keep our dollar as the reserve currency. Remember I said it, and it will be easy. It’ll be easy. But this is how we will end the era of inflation, mayhem, misery under Kamala and Crooked Joe. And unleash safety, prosperity, and peace for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. That’s what we’re going to do. Together we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates, low inflation so that everyone can afford groceries, a car and a home. Very simple.
(01:15:32)
We will stop the invasion, end migrant crime, support our police, strengthen our military. I want to wish a happy 77th birthday to the United States Air Force. And if you remember, I created Space Force, which was the last, since Air Force, which will soon be five years old. Space Force has turned out to be very important. We will build a missile defense shield around our country, keep critical race theory and transgender insanity out of our schools, and we will keep men out of women’s sports.
(01:16:25)
We will defend the Second Amendment, restore free speech. And we will secure our elections, and we will secure our borders. Everyone will prosper. Every family will thrive and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and the crooked Democrats. So we must stop her country-destroying liberal agenda once and for all. So get everyone you know and vote. We want to a landslide that is very simply too big to rig. Too big to rig. Right, Bruce? Too big to rig, Joe. Too big to rig. Too big to rig, Joe. I think we can do that, too.
(01:17:26)
On November 5th, we will save our economy. We will rescue our middle class. We will reclaim our sovereignty and restore our borders. We will put America first and we will take back our country. Because together we will make America powerful again. Make America wealthy again. Make America healthy again. Make America strong again. Make America proud again. Make America safe again. Make America free again. And we will make America great again.
(01:18:08)
Thank you very much. We love New York. Love New York. God bless you all. Nice seeing you.

USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!

Donald Trump (00:09):

Thank you very much, everybody. Hello, Las Vegas. Hello, Las Vegas. I’m thrilled to be back in this incredible state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots, which is what you are. As you all saw three months ago, we had a monumental victory. We had a beautiful victory three months ago. And then, a couple of nights ago, we had an even better victory. We took her on, Comrade Kamala Harris. We took her on and we did really well. Every poll had us up like 90, 92, 87. We actually had one, 92 to 6, which sounds about right because now today, Rasmussen just came up, and we were six points up. So, it’s pretty good. Pretty good. We dismantled her terrible record, we exposed her radical liberal agenda, and we laid out our plans to quite simply make America great again. Meanwhile, Comrade Kamala Harris, Comrade showed up, spewing lies and meaningless platitudes with no plans, no policies, and no solutions whatsoever. She doesn’t have a clue. The only thing she had was a lot of people trying to push her over the line. It’s not happening. We’re not going to let this country be destroyed. It’s already in deep trouble. She offered American voters nothing but falsehoods and hoaxes while our country is being destroyed. Our country is being destroyed, do we know that?

Audience (02:11):

Yes!

Donald Trump (02:13):

Not going to be for long.

Audience (02:15):

Fire her!

Donald Trump (02:16):

Honestly, November, November 5th, is going to be the most important day in the history of our country, I really believe it.
(02:27)
And today, she had a terrible interview. Did you see the interview she had today? She can’t talk. She can’t talk. She can’t talk without maybe getting the answers. What’s the story with that? Did she get the questions, do you think? So, I hear she got the questions, and I also heard she had something in the ear, a little something in the ear. “No Kamala, do this. Say it this way, Kamala. Okay, be quiet. Too many people watching.” She had a terrible interview today with the Philadelphia TV station. A big word salad. She just kept talking, talking, talking. She had no idea what the hell she was saying. She reminded me of Sleepy Joe Biden.
(03:18)
But people said that I was angry during debate, and I said, “Why wouldn’t I be angry? Of course I’m angry. We got 21 million people that came into our country, invading our communities, invading our cities and our towns, and destroying our country. I’m angry about Venezuelan gangs taking over Aurora, Colorado, and I’m angry about illegal Haitian migrants taking over Springfield, Ohio.” You see that mess, don’t you? And the Colorado governor is petrified. He’s scared. He doesn’t know what to do. “The Venezuelans are attacking my state!” He said. “The Venezuelans have big AK-47 Supremes.” This is Supreme. Where the hell do they get these guns? Our soldiers can’t get these guns. They’re taking over our country from within, can you believe?
(04:22)
Then we got Kamala. I’m angry about young American girls being raped and murdered by savage criminal aliens that come into our country very easily, but very illegally. I’m angry about rampant inflation destroying our middle class. And the American people are damn angry, too. We’re all angry. Country’s being wrecked. That’s why, 53 days from now, we’re going to tell Harris that we’ve had enough. Our country can’t take it anymore. Comrade Kamala Harris, you’re fired! You’re fired! Get out! Get out! All right? Right, [inaudible 00:05:07]? Get the hell out of here!
(05:19)
She shouldn’t be there anyway, she got no votes. She’s a threat to democracy, right? That’s what they say. They always say, “Donald Trump,” you know it’s a sound bite for them? “Donald Trump is a threat to democracy.” Now she’s a threat. Think of it, Joe Biden had 14 million votes; she had none. She was the first one that failed. Out of all the candidates, I think they had 22, she didn’t even make it to Iowa, the first stop. Didn’t even make it. During the nominating process, she didn’t make it to Iowa. She had no votes and she got it. But we’re running against her. I think based on what I’m seeing in the polls, I think she could be just as easy as him. He was down so much. He was down 21 points, and they went to him and they said, “Get out of here, Sleepy Joe, you’re going to lose.” “I’m not going to get out. I won’t do it.” He held on for about a day.
(06:19)
Did you see the hat, though, the other day, right? He walked into a great, beautiful area in Pennsylvania. I was there, because that’s where one of the planes came down, you know that. It was incredible, the reverence that we had for that area. It’s horrible. But the bravery of those people on that plane. But the fire station, which was so brave also, and they did a fantastic job, and the place was stacked with every family member. And Joe went in first and nobody… They didn’t even, you could hear a pin drop. And then one of the firemen said, “Put the hat on! Put it on.” And I thought he was a little bit rough cash. I thought he was a little bit rough, actually. You know we’re talking to the president of the United States, right? But this fireman, rough guy, obviously a Trump fan.
(07:20)
So, they throw him a make America great… Look at them, look at all of them. Oh, I love your hat. Stand up. Stand up. Look at that. No, no, stand up, right there. Turn around. Show the cameras. I love that. I love that hat. You’re going to have to give me that hat later. I’m going to have to make it, okay? Would you do that? You’re so cute. Oh, I’m not allowed to say that! That could be the end of my political career. We’re not allowed to say that anymore. That’s a great hat.
(07:58)
But they looked at Joe, they said, “Put on the hat.” “No, no, I can’t do that. It wouldn’t look good. It says Trump on it.” No, it doesn’t say that. It says, “Make America great again.” And then the guy goes, “Put it on! Put it on! Now!” “Okay.” And he puts it on, and the rest is history. It was so bad. Right? The rest is history. Sleepy Joe. What’s better, Sleepy Joe or Crooked Joe? Okay, ready? A free poll. You know it’s Friday night, we have a lot of time, right? Do you think, later on, should I do The Snake or not? People love The Snake. It’s so appropriate. Okay, you ready? A quick poll. Ready? I’ll go Sleepy Joe, and then I’ll go Crooked Joe. Ready? Who likes Sleepy Joe? Who likes Crooked Joe?
(09:24)
All right, thank you. I just saved $200,000 with these phony pollsters. They don’t even go out and check. They just give you a number. “Sir, that’ll cost $250,000 to interview 200 people.” Oh, thank you, you just did it for nothing. And they don’t interview the 200, but they just put down a number. “Let’s see, Trump is ahead 50 to 46.” No, that was something.
(09:53)
And then by the way, two hours later, I walked into the same firehouse. The place went crazy. Right? The most preposterous part of Kamala… And how do you like the name Comrade Kamala Harris? You know why? It indicates that she is a communist comrade, because she is. You know that she’s further left than crazy Bernie Sanders? Can you believe it? He’s crazy, that guy. He’s almost as crazy as Nancy Pelosi. She’s nuts. The most preposterous part of Kamala’s debate performance was when she tried to gaslight the public into believing she never supported the radical left policies that she has championed for her entire career. Do you mind if we roll a tape, please? Let’s roll a tape. Go ahead.

Kamala Harris (10:52):

Gun owners, we’re not taking anybody’s guns away, so stop with the continuous lying about this stuff. I support buybacks.

Interviewer 1 (11:00):

How mandatory is your gun buyback program?

Kamala Harris (11:03):

It’s mandatory. I will not ban fracking. I have not banned fracking as vice president of the United States. And in fact, I was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking.

Interviewer 2 (11:16):

Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your first day in office, adding the United States to the list of countries who have banned this devastating practice?

Kamala Harris (11:25):

There’s no question, I’m in favor of banning fracking. I absolutely support, and over the last four years as vice president… Private healthcare options.

Jake Tapper (11:33):

You support the Medicare for All bill, I think-

Kamala Harris (11:35):

Correct.

Jake Tapper (11:35):

… initially co-sponsored by Senator Bernie Sanders. You’re also a co-sponsor onto it.

Kamala Harris (11:38):

Yes.

Jake Tapper (11:39):

I believe it will totally eliminate private insurance. So, for people out there who like their insurance, they don’t get to keep it?

Kamala Harris (11:46):

Listen, the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care, and you don’t have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. Who of us has not had that situation, where you got to wait for approval, and the doctor says, “I don’t know if your insurance company is going to cover this.” Let’s eliminate all of that. Let’s move on.

Audience (12:09):

Boo!

Donald Trump (12:17):

Everything is a lie, including the fact that she never worked at McDonald’s. She lied about that, too. I told that to one of the fake news people two days ago. I was doing a news conference and the fake news was there. I said, “You people all said she worked beautifully at McDonald’s. It turned out it was a lie. Will you admit it? Will you admit it?” I said. And they said, “Oh yeah, we’ll admit.” They never did. They don’t want to. They’re protecting her. I don’t know why. She wants open borders, she wants, Pennsylvania, zero… You know what’s going to happen? There’ll never be fracking in Pennsylvania. They’re going to take away your guns, you saw that, they’re going to take away your guns. She’s going to take away your guns. Would anybody like to give up their gun?

Audience (13:08):

No!

Donald Trump (13:08):

Would anybody like to voluntarily, with great liberal fanfare, say, “I’d like to give up my weapon, so that I can be shot-”

Audience (13:17):

No!

Donald Trump (13:18):

“… in my house.” But she’s clearly not well. Take a look at these videos. Look at this, real fast.

Kamala Harris (13:27):

And being a bitch. Turn that off!
(13:44)
Okay, we got to get to some business. We got to get to some business. Okay. Thank you, all. Okay. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you, thank you. Thank you, thank you. Please! Thank you, please. Thank you so very much. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Okay, let’s get to business. Let’s get to business.

Audience (14:14):

Boo!

Donald Trump (14:15):

She said “thank you” 38 times. And at the end it was, “Thank you, thank you, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank.” I said, “What the hell’s… What’s wrong with her?” I say, “Thank you.” And you wait a couple of seconds. You say, “Thank you.” Again. You say, “Come on, let’s get going. Thank you,” one more time. 38 times. “Thank you, thank, thank, thank, thank.” There’s something wrong with her, okay? Or as she would say, “She’s weird. She’s weird.” That was another soundbite they made up about J. D. and myself. No, we’re solid people. We’re very solid. We’re very solid people. We’re not weird. They’re weird. How about the vice president? How about the vice president? Now, he’s weird.
(15:08)
Despite all of these flagrant lies and the many other hoaxes she spread, the fake news moderators did not check her out. They didn’t check what Comrade Kamala Harris… Do you see the lies that she was making up? Project 2025, I’ve said a hundred times, I know nothing about it. I had nothing to do. She goes out with a commercial. “I support this, I support that, I support 25.” All lies, and lies that she knows are lies, that have been debunked, as they say, in the crazy news organization. Hey, that’s a lot of press we have back there. That’s a lot of fake news.

Audience (15:51):

Boo!

Donald Trump (15:53):

That’s a lot of fake news. Meanwhile, every time they interfered to fact check me, it turned out that they were wrong, and Trump was right. For example, a big one, I said that crime was up massively. I didn’t want to go into the details. What’s the purpose? Crime was up massively. And David Muir, he’s another one doesn’t have a clue, you know? And his hair was much better five years ago, I can tell you. But David Muir barged in to claim that, “Sir! Crime was down.” And he said, quote, “President Trump, as you know, the FBI,” Oh! “Says overall, violent crime is coming down in this country.” Now let me, you don’t have to see this. You see what the hell is happening with crime? Who would say it was down, even if without looking? So, he reprimanded me for saying that crime was up.
(17:09)
And somebody in our government, at a very high level, likes me. And they released the real numbers. It said, yeah, in breaking news, just yesterday night, the premier statistical agency at the Department of Justice, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, released brand new data showing that since Kamala Harris took office, violent crime, nationwide, is up 40%. Rape is up 42%. Car theft is up 42%. Robberies are up 67%. Aggravated assaults are up much more than 55%. And violent crime with a weapon is up 56%. Violent attacks on strangers, I never heard of that one, is up 61+%. So, David Muir owes me an apology, do you agree?
(18:15)
She lies about everything, just like she lied about jobs. They said they had 818,000 jobs, and it was a fraud. They didn’t, they just wanted to pad the numbers before the election. But fortunately, we had a leaker or a whistleblower, I don’t care which, I love that person. I’m not sure who it is. And that person said that it was a total fraud. They wanted to announce the correction. They were going to do a correction right after the election. They were going to do it on the 10th of November. They just wanted to get by the election. So, they fraudulently added 818,000 jobs. Isn’t that unbelievable? And yesterday they announced, “Yes, it was a slip up.” 818,000. Because their job numbers were looking like, “Where the hell did all those jobs come from?” You know where they came from? Somebody’s sick brain, that’s where they came from.
(19:18)
Under Kamala Harris and the communist left, our country is under invasion. We are under invasion, just like it was an army. Except, in many ways, it’s more difficult, because they don’t wear a uniform. You don’t know who the hell to go after. Millions and millions of illegal aliens are coming in from all over the world, from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums, and many terrorists, at numbers that we’ve never seen before. Terrorists are coming into our country.
(19:49)
If you look at 2019, and I disagree with this, really, even though it’s good for me, they said in the year 2019, not one terrorist… There’s an official definition of that, but you don’t want to hear it. Not one terrorist came in. That was my year, 2019, one of my years. Not one terrorist came into the country. Now, I sort of can’t believe that. But it was pretty close, it was pretty close. And now we have thousands and thousands and thousands of terrorists coming into our country. They’re coming in from parts unknown. This will not end well, unless Donald J. Trump is elected the 47th president of the United States, right? Not going to end well, right?

Audience (20:32):

Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump!

Donald Trump (20:55):

Because I am your border president. From now on,

Donald Trump (21:01):

I want to be your border president. I did a great job in 2016 on the border and we solved the problem very, very quickly, a beautiful job. And in 2020 when I got millions of more votes than I did in 2016 … By the way, we did much better in 2020. Everybody knows that. Everybody knows that, but my people would say, “Sir, they don’t want to hear about the border.” I said, “I want to talk about it. I did a great job.” They don’t care. “You’ve solved the border …” It was solved. It was beautiful. The difference is that this border crisis is 20 times worse than it was in 2016, but I’ll get it solved, I’ll get it solved fast, and we’ll get back to making our country strong again.
(21:49)
And I only want to be addressed no longer as Mr. President, Mr. Boarder President, sir, because we got to get this border fixed. We got people coming in that have never even dreamed about being in this country, and they’re coming in totally unchecked. Nobody has any idea where the hell they come from. Kamala would be the president of invasion and I will be the president of making this country stronger, better, more beautiful, bigger, more powerful, wealthier, safer than ever before. I will protect our country. She will surrender our country. She has already let in 21 million people and if she gets four more years in America, our country will be obliterated. The 21 million people will be hundreds of millions of people will come in from all over the world, which is where they’re coming from now. You’ll have 150 million more people. You won’t have a country anymore. You’re pretty close to not having one. You better hope I get elected. You better go out. You’ll have a country back soon.
(23:09)
You’ll have your country back soon. Not only is Harris … Do you ever notice when you say Harris, nobody knows who the hell you’re talking about. You ever? No, nobody has any idea. Harris. Hey is … Where’s Harris? They know Kamala. They know Kambabla. That was the nickname I used for a while, but I don’t use it anymore because everyone thought I was just mispronouncing her name. I wasn’t. Kambabla.
(23:40)
But no. Comrade is the best because it says she’s a Marxist, communist, fascist person, which is … She’s a fascist. Who the hell ever thought would be voting for a communist for president? She is. Look at her record. Do you know that she wanted to have transgender surgery on illegal aliens that came into our country that were in jail? Can you believe it? She wanted. Did anyone know that? I would say that’s quite a liberal thing to do, don’t you think? Where the hell did she come from?
(24:19)
Honestly, I am not a big fan of Crooked Joe, but he would’ve been better than her. He really would’ve been. They didn’t want her. She was the last one on the list. They had 22 people they were looking at and the people voted. She was the last one on the list, and I’m running against her. It should be a good thing. Look, based on … That’s sort of like a poll. It should be a good thing, but it’s so unfair to our country and it’s unfair to Crooked Joe. I feel badly. Does anybody feel badly for Joe?

Audience (24:50):

No.

Donald Trump (24:51):

No?

Audience (24:51):

No.

Donald Trump (24:54):

He was the worst president in the history of our country. She is the worst vice president in the history of our country. And the only good thing, he’s an old man now, and I’m sure he’s watching right now, but President Jimmy Carter, his administration looks totally brilliant by comparison. So he no longer has to go down as the worst president because this group … I used to say, and I used to say it a lot, but if you took the 10 worst presidents or administrations, but 10 worst presidents in the history of our country and added them up, they would not have done the damage that this one presidency has done to our country. What’s happened to our country? We’re a laughing stock all over the world. You think President Xi is enjoying it, but he won’t be enjoying it for long. Not only is Kamala allowing millions of illegal aliens to stampede across our border, but she is flying them in from other countries.
(26:01)
Once she said a couple of months ago, they put on some extra little breaks to make their numbers look a little bit better, but they forgot to tell you that they’re flying in hundreds of thousands of people right over the border. And I was with Art Del Cueto. I was with the people from border control today or Border Patrol today, and they said, “No, those numbers don’t register.” In other words, they don’t count when they fly them in. They’re flying them in in beautiful jet planes. They’re flying them to Idaho. Idaho potatoes. I don’t think they want them. They’re flying them to Iowa. They’re flying them all over. Now we have only border states okay? Who would believe this fake … They’re saying, “No, no. We want to stop them,” but they’re flying them in by the tens of thousands on big, beautiful jet airplanes. They’re flying them in. These people sick and they’re destroying our country. You got to get out and vote and make sure they’re not cheating. Make sure your vote counts.
(27:12)
Over the past three-and-a-half years, Harris and Biden have resettled a half a million illegal migrants from Haiti, including over 200,000 that she has flown into the United States by very beautiful airplanes, I’d like to have one so nice, and deposit them into American communities all over the country. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday, “A Venezuelan gang is expanding its deadly reach into the United States. They’ve become real estate developers,” like I used to be. “They’re taking over apartment houses in Colorado.” The story begins, “U.S. law enforcement officials have watched with alarm the spread of Venezuelan gangs known as dismembering rivals.” They’re dismembering rivals from Chile and from Colombia. They’re dismembering. You know what that means? Cutting them up. They’re cutting them up. How the hell did we allow this to happen to our country?
(28:14)
Likewise, The New York Times, or as I call it, the failing New York Times, it’s a failing paper. The Washington Post is a failing paper. Will you fail already? Just get out. They’re such phonies. If The New York Times writes a story about you just go the opposite. If you go the exact opposite, it’ll be very accurate. The failing New York Times today reports this vicious Venezuelan prison gang is “Snick.” It sneaked into the United States among the millions of migrants who have crossed the border and is peddling drugs, guns, and women across the 50 states from urban centers like New York and Chicago to Florida beaches and once tranquil Middle America in Colorado. The gang even got a green light to shoot the cops. They were given an okay to shoot the cops. How about that?
(29:09)
I just met a lot of great policemen backstage and police women backstage. That’s not acceptable, but they were given an okay. When I returned to the White House, I will launch a special task force of elite federal law enforcement and charge them with crushing and eliminating every foreign gang and organized crime network that is conquering our country. They’re conquering our country.
(29:36)
We will deploy ICE, DHS, and other federal officials to go in and liberate Aurora. We’re going to … Can you believe I’m saying that? Can you believe I have to say this? We are going to liberate parts of our country. Let’s go back another 300 years. We are going to liberate our country. Did you ever think I would be standing here? It’s a hell of a way to get elected. The only good thing about what they’re doing is it’s great for the guy that happens to be running against these idiots, okay? It’s the only thing. That’s the only benefit. That’s the only benefit I can see is running against them is a very good thing. But last week, a high school girl in Virginia was walking to the bus stop when an illegal alien from Kamala Harris caught and released into the United States and let go by her, drove up behind her pretending to be a police officer.
(30:33)
He said, I’m a police officer. He wasn’t. The predator got out, grabbed her, and forced her into his car. She had to escape by throwing herself out of a moving vehicle, believing she would be raped or murdered. She was very badly hurt.
(30:50)
Also, this month, an illegal alien who entered our country through Kamala’s phone app. Could you believe we have phone apps? You know where they go to? The cartels. The cartels have apps where they call in so they know where to deposit their illegal people that, and they’re making billions. They’ll be in the Forbes 400 along with your friend, me. I’ll say, I don’t believe it. This guy, he doesn’t speak English. He can’t read or write, and he’s worth $10 billion. That tells you something, doesn’t it? If they put all of these people into the Forbes 400. Used to be a big list. I don’t know if it’s a big list. I think Forbes is failing pretty badly now. I haven’t heard about it in a long time, but they’d occupy a large section of the list.
(31:38)
But they have an app. An app where they call so they know where they can illegally drop these people. An illegal alien who entered our country through Kamala’s phone app was doing things that nobody believed. He was arrested for the murder of a 25-year-old woman in Tennessee. And in August, an illegal alien from Honduras, a beautiful place, who was previously deported under the Trump administration, was arrested for stabbing a young, beautiful 14-year-old girl with a butcher knife as she watched her brother’s baseball game. He was just doing a horrible thing.
(32:19)
Who would like to hear the snake, because I have nothing but time tonight. I got a lot of time. They love the snake. You know why? It’s something that’s highly accurate. It was a song many years ago and we reworked it a little bit and it became something that people like, but it’s very accurate in terms of what it represents for this country. And very sad, too. I will tell you. So let’s go. You ready?

Audience (32:52):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (32:54):

On her way to work, one morning down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor half-frozen snake. His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. “Poor thing,” she cried. “I’ll take you in and I’ll take care of you.” “Take me in, oh, tender woman. Take me in, for heaven’s sake. Take me in, oh, tender woman,” cried the vicious snake. She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk and laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk. She hugged and kissed him brightly. The work that night had gone. She found the pretty snake she had taken in had been revived. “Take me in, oh, tender woman. Take me in, for heaven’s sake. Take me in, oh, tender woman,” cried that vicious snake. She clutched him to her bosom. “You’re so beautiful,” she sighed. “But if I hadn’t taken you in by now, you truly would have died.” She stroked his pretty skin again and kissed and held him tight. But instead of saying, “Thank you, ma’am,” the snake gave her a vicious bite.
(34:17)
Surprise.
(34:17)
“Take me in oh, tender woman. Take me in, for heaven’s sake. Take me in, oh, tender woman,” sighed the vicious snake. “I saved you,” cried the woman, “And you’ve bitten me. But why? You know your bite is poisonous and now I’m going to die.” “Shut up, silly woman,” sighed the reptile with a grin. “You know damn well I was a snake before you took me in.”
(34:49)
And that’s the end of the story. [inaudible 00:34:51]. And I had to do that sucker by memory because there’s no light up here. As much light, I’m dark. It’s like dark. I had two problems. It’s dark and the print on that thing is so light you couldn’t read it. So I did the best I could, but not bad, right? I couldn’t see. Michael, I couldn’t see a fricking word. I said, “I have an idea. Let’s do this snake.” And then I take it out. I say, “Oh, my God. That’s a very light print. Oh, my God. There’s no light.” Between the light and the print. I’m saying, “What the hell am I doing this for?” But it wasn’t bad. And you get the point. When I’m a president and when I become your president, when we all — we’re going to all work together. We’re going to make it happen. We will get the illegal alien, murderers, rapists, and child predators the hell out of our country, and we will not ever, ever, ever let them back in. So Nevada, get out and vote. We win this state. We’re going to win the whole thing. We win this, we’re going to win the whole thing.
(36:01)
If we win this state, we win everything. And the people of Nevada also need to get out and vote for some really great people. And you have to vote against a really terrible radical left senator named Jacky Rosen. She does a terrible job. We have running a man of the border, and I’m going to introduce you to him, but Jacky Rosen has voted with Crooked Joe Biden nearly 100% of the time. She voted for every single inflation-causing spending bill. And she also voted for Joe Biden’s Open Borders bill to set a minimum of two million illegal aliens per year. So can you imagine? They said this was a good bill and that doesn’t include the fly-ins, and it doesn’t include all of the other people that get in. They come in through places that we wouldn’t even believe. They go through Snake Mountain running against Wacky Jacky is an American hero named Sam Brown. Sam Brown. Sam Brown.
(37:17)
His wife is fantastic also, Amy. But Sam Brown has given up more than anybody who has ever run for the United States Senate. Remember that. He’s given up more than anybody who’s ever run for the United States Senate. He’s a hero, too. A hero, a real brave person. Sam is a fearless patriot and Purple Heart recipient who served our country as a U.S. Army captain, totally respected in Afghanistan where he was very severely wounded. But Sam survived. He persevered. He came back. He’s stronger than ever. He’s a great guy. I’ve gotten to know him well. He’s a great guy. And I said to him tonight, “Sam, I’m going to be the border president. You should be the border senator.” And he said, “I am. I actually am,” because he believes us and he is the border … Think of him when you vote. He’s going to close up the border. She wants to leave your border open. He became a small businessman and a leader here in Nevada. And now he’s going to fight for this state like nobody has ever fought before. Sam Brown will vote to secure our border, stop inflation, strengthen our military, defend religious liberty, and cut taxes like you have never heard because Sam Brown thinks of one thing and one thing alone. It’s called America First. That’s what he wants. And he told me that. And he’s an incredible guy. And I want you to remember this because look, I’ll be back a few more times before the day. 53 days now. But I want you to remember this with Sam. He truly has. He’s given up so much. Nobody’s given up like he’s given up. So much. And he wants to do this because he loves our country. He fought for our country. Nobody’s given up like he’s given up. So much. And Sam, I’d love to have you come up and say a few words, please. Sam Brown.

Sam Brown (39:41):

Nevada, we need the border president back because not only has Kamala Harris, as the border czar, failed America, but Jacky Rosen has failed America. She sits on the Homeland Security Committee. I know a little something about leadership. And leadership requires us to do the harder right rather than the easier wrong. And when Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have asked Jacky Rosen to be quiet and to vote and support their policies against the better judgment and what is good for this country in this state, she has been a follower and not a leader. And I will be that leader.
(40:47)
I tell you, I want to speak to you for a moment as a father. Amy and I have three children, school age children, the crisis on the border. There has been over 320,000 unaccompanied children who have come into our country that this administration has lost accountability of and the military, when you lose accountability, you are fired. We must, we must for the sake of these children. We must for the sake of our communities. We must for the sovereignty of this nation secure our border, confront the cartel, and make America great again.
(41:45)
Now, with respect, President Trump —

Audience (41:50):

[inaudible 00:41:51].

Sam Brown (41:51):

— 16 years ago, an enemy tried to take my life. Sir, I

Sam Brown (42:00):

I know what a warrior is. I know what it looks like when someone comes under fire and defiantly stands up in the face of that enemy and says, “It is time to fight. Fight, fight.”

Speaker 1 (42:13):

Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.

Sam Brown (42:30):

I will fight for this country both as a father and as a warrior. And I have seen a warrior’s spirit in you that I have only ever seen on the battlefield. And I know that you have had the responsibility, President Trump, you have had the sacred responsibility and honor of giving the highest awards our nation can give to people. And I just want to, as a token of appreciation from me, as someone who has been wounded for this country just like you, to give you the thing that I can only offer out of my own heart and love for this country, appreciation, admiration for your leadership, my story that I hope inspires many to be a warrior like you. And here it is, A Live Day.

Donald Trump (43:34):

Thank you, sir.

Sam Brown (43:45):

Nevada, I’ve got you.

Speaker 1 (43:48):

Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Sam.

Sam Brown (44:02):

We will be victorious in November. And President Trump will be the border president and I will be the border senator. Let’s win.

Speaker 1 (44:13):

USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA.

Donald Trump (44:39):

That was great. I’ll tell you, you got to vote for him. You got to vote for him. Nobody’s been through what he has been through. Nobody ever what he’s been through. And he wants to put his life on the line again. And he wants to do it for you. And he is going to do it. And he’s your border senator. He’s going to be great. And she’s the exact opposite. She’s your open border and you don’t want open borders. You’ve had millions of people come in right here. They’re coming in here more than any place else now because Texas has closed it up pretty well. But they’ve done nothing here. You got to get it. You got to get them in.
(45:11)
I also want to thank your Governor, Joe Lombardo, has been fantastic to us. He’s been great. And he’s right now out in the wildfires in Western Nevada, which are really taking a toll. Joe’s been great. And our prayers go out to every Nevada family that, every one of them that’s been forced to evacuate due to these raging fires. They’re raging. And we love you all. And Governor, we thank you very much. He’s done a fantastic job.
(45:42)
And another man who’s doing a fantastic job, Lieutenant Governor Stavros, Anthony Stavros. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Stavros. Thank you. Good man. Candidate for the 4th Congressional District, John Lee. John. John Lee. Good, John. I heard you’re doing well. Get out and vote. I heard you’re doing really good. Candidate for the 3rd Congressional District, Drew Johnson. Great honor to endorse you guys. I endorse them. Nevada GOP Chairman, somebody that works like hell, he wants this so badly. He’s never wanted anything so badly other than his family, of course, Michael McDonald. Great guy. We’re going to win it, Michael. Going to win it. I think so. We do have a good lead, but we got to be careful because remember, they cheat like hell. It’s the only thing they’re good at.
(46:44)
A man who’s a friend of mine who writes the nicest things about me and really a celebrity and just a great guy, Wayne Allyn Root. Good man, good man. And a brilliant young man who has always been with me no matter what, the good times, the bad times. You see him on television a lot. He’s always talking about the border. It’s a passion because he knows our country’s being destroyed, Stephen Miller. Where is he? He’s here someplace. He’s a great guy. He knows more about illegal immigration, I think, than anybody in history. He knows it and he gets it.
(47:31)
A man who’s also been with me just about from the beginning, he’s tough, he’s smart, he loves our country and he is a warrior, Kash Patel. Thank you, Kash. And Rick Harrison. Where’s Rick? Rick, Rick Harrison. Rick. Thank you, Rick. Thank you very much. We have another person here. I said you have to get up there because he’s… I love warriors and this guy is really a warrior. Do not fight him under any circumstances. He won the Olympic gold medal and he’s the UFC and was the UFC champion numerous times actually. And I wonder if I could take him. I’m a little larger than him. I wonder if I could take him in a fight. What do you think? You were the big hat. Could I take him in a fight? Henry, you know who I’m talking about? Henry Sunuho. Henry Sunuho, come here. Come here. Henry Sunuho. Now who thinks I can take Henry in a fight? I’ve got a little height on him, but he’s got everything else. Come here. We love you, man. This guy is a winner. Here, say something.

Henry Sunuho (48:58):

Well, Mr. President, I’m just honored and I think I would’ve just bent the knee. I would never fight you. For what you do for our country and the fact that you were willing to risk your life when you had no… You have no reason to do this, but you’re doing this for the people. It means a lot. And as I told you before, President, I love this country so much, Mr. President, that I named my daughter America. And I appreciate what you’ve done and I appreciate what you’re doing. Let’s continue to keep making America great again.

Donald Trump (49:43):

And he’s got good hair, too. Look at that hair. Got no hair problem, right, henry? None. He’s a great guy. Gold medal winner. Latin music superstar, Nicky Jam. Do you know Nicky? She’s hot. Where is Nicky? Where is Nicky? Thank you, Nicky. Great to be having you here. Now you have to get… Oh look, come here. Come here. I’m glad he came up.

Nicky Jam (50:17):

It’s an honor to me to meet you, Mr. President. People that come from where I come from, they don’t meet the president. So I’m really, I’m lucky, I’m going to say this, but we need you. We need you back, right? We need you to be the president. And apart from that, I got to say this in Spanish: [foreign language 00:50:43]. Let’s make America great again.

Donald Trump (50:57):

And we have all different kinds of stars than we did 10 years ago and 20 years ago. Used to be a little simpler. Now it’s a whole different world, but the numbers they get are incredible. Bryce Hall is here, one of the biggest. Bryce, where’s Bryce? Bryce Hall, where are you, Bryce? Stand up, Bryce? Come on up here, Bryce. Get up here. Come on. What the hell? We have to have Bryce. He does an interview with people… Come on up if you want, Bryce, come on. What the hell? We have a lot of time, right? Come on, Bryce. Look how young he is, how handsome he is. Come on up, Bryce. This guy has 44 million people watching him and he’s great. He’s a great guy. Say a few words.

Nicky Jam (51:55):

We need Trump back really bad. Make America great again.

Donald Trump (52:06):

And a while ago, a couple of years ago, a legend named Dana White called me. He said, “Would you do me a big favor? Would you do an interview with some guys, young guys?” “Who are they?” He said, “The Nelk Boys. The Nelk Boys.” And I said, “Who the hell are they?” I don’t know. And I agreed to do it. And they were great. And the interview was aired and we had got 200 million people. I said, “Who the hell are these guys?” And now everybody knows who they are. The Nelk Boys. Where are you guys? Where are you? You hear someplace? Thank you, fellas. You want to come up? If you want, come up. Come up. Come on, get up here. Get up here.
(52:54)
And while they’re coming up, I want to introduce somebody that’s been incredible. She was a very popular politician. Now she says very popular period. She was the Democrat presidential candidate. She knocked out, she knocked the hell out of somebody named Comrade. You know that. Tulsi Gabbard is here and her husband is here, Abraham. Thank you, Tulsi. Thank you very much, Tulsi.
(53:20)
Say a couple of words.

Speaker 2 (53:27):

We need Trump back and we need him back bad. One more thing I know that’s passionate about, Governor Tim Walz, he put a 95% tax on Zyn. We got to get that removed, President Trump.

Donald Trump (53:41):

Thank you.

Speaker 3 (53:45):

Trump 2024, that’s it. Let’s fucking go.

Donald Trump (53:54):

These are young guys, but they have plenty of cash, I can tell you that. And they’re great [inaudible 00:54:06]. And it was just pointed out, and the real number is 325,000 migrant children are lost. They’re being raped or they’re being killed. A lot of them are no longer with us. They lost it during the last three years, 325,000 children, young children. Think of it. Never to see their parents again. They’re either gone or they’re in the service as slaves, sex slaves or slaves. And I just think it’s terrible.
(54:37)
They talk about us like we’re evil people. They lost 325,000 young kids. Think of what that means. Think of what that means. As Vice President Harris cast the tie-breaking votes that caused the worst inflation in American history, costing us and the typical family, the typical family, $28,000. Think of that, 28,000. With me, it was the opposite, the exact opposite.
(55:01)
Days ago it was announced that we lost 438,000 full-time jobs in August. That’s a record. We lost almost a half a million jobs in August. They like to go around saying how well they’re doing. They’re doing terribly. Inflation makes everything bad anyway. They had the highest ever.
(55:22)
We lost 24,000 manufacturing jobs and nearly 6,000 auto manufacturing jobs. And I’ll tell you what, the United Auto Workers, those guys are going to vote for me. Those guys and gals, they’re going to vote for me. They’re going to vote for me because the auto industry is moving to Mexico, it’s moving to China, and it’s moving to other parts of the world, but not the United States. China’s building two massive auto plants in Mexico now, and they think they’re going to build cars and put them into our country. Not going to happen. It’s not going to happen. They’ve got authorization from Biden. You know why? Because they gave them a lot of cash. That’s why. And nobody talks about it.
(56:05)
Last month alone, American-born workers lost 1.3 million jobs as migrants gained 635,000 jobs in a single month. The jobs, almost every single job was taken by a migrant worker. And Black workers are losing their jobs to these people that are pouring into our country and Hispanics are losing their jobs. And next will be unions. Unions are going to be losing all of their power, all of their clout. But the Black worker and the Black family, they’re losing their jobs. Hispanics are losing their jobs. The people that pour into our country illegally.
(56:47)
Now Kamala is pushing the largest individual and small business tax increase in American history. And she said that a 70 to 80% tax rate is something that’s very, very doable. ” It’s a bold idea,” she said, “and it must be discussed.” Now she changed that a little bit, but with a politician, they always go back to their original thought.
(57:09)
Harris and Biden waged war on American energy, opened up the Russian pipeline, Nord Stream 2 that I had closed, but shut down the Keystone XL Pipeline that I had opened. She reentered the horribly unfair to the United States US-Paris Climate Accord. I want it to be the Nevada Climate Accord, not the Paris. It’s the most unfair document you’ve ever seen. And she has always said, “I will ban fracking.” And she has always said, “I will defund the police.” She was the head of the Defund the Police movement. Anybody that was with that scam for even a week is not fit to serve as the President of the United States. As California Attorney General, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon and rape of an unconscious person. These are categories, all categories, horrible categories, but she redefined them as, in all cases, nonviolent crimes.
(58:25)
Kamala supports states being able to take minor children and perform sex change operations on them without their parents’ consent. Did you know that? Did you know that? Now she’ll say, “Oh no, I don’t. I never said that.” But we can put up the tapes anytime you want. I don’t even want to show… They’re so disgusting, I don’t want to show them. Despite the false fact check by the fake moderators, those guys at ABC Fake News.
(58:53)
In the debate this week, her running mate tampon Tim, who put tampons in young boys’ bathrooms. He even signed a law that allows abortion in the ninth month. He says abortion in the ninth month and babies to be executed after birth. And that’s right. And it’s happened numerous times in the states and other states too. There are radical left states that allow that. Nobody wants to talk about it, but they allow that, execution after birth.
(59:35)
But from the moment we take back the White House from Comrade Kamala Harris, I believe we are going to have the four greatest years in the history of our country. Starting on day one, I will seal the border and stop the migrant invasion. We will carry out the largest deportation operation of criminals in American history. We will defeat inflation quickly and we will make America affordable again. We’re getting your prices way down.
(01:00:12)
We will make America the dominant energy producer in the world by far. I already had it above Russia and Saudi Arabia. Then we had a terrible result in a horrible election, an election where I got, remember, more votes than any sitting president ever by far, by millions. We have more liquid gold under our feet than any country in the world. Think of it. We are standing on more liquid gold under our feet than any country in the world, and we’re going to use it. In 12 months, I will cut your energy costs in half, and that includes heating, air conditioning, electricity, and gasoline for your car. As part of our efforts to increase housing affordability, I will work with your governor to open up new tracks of federal land for large-scale housing construction, and you’ll get it from a much lower price. More than 80% of all land in Nevada is owned by the federal government. Governor Lombardo has sent three letters to the Biden-Harris administration, asking them to open up some of this land to help alleviate the crisis. But Kamala and crooked Joe did not even have the decency to reply to those requests.
(01:01:38)
Under the Trump administration, the pleas of Nevada will be ignored no longer. We’re going to open it up. We’re going to open. We’ll start with a small portion, you’ll get it going, and then we’re going to open up large portions of land. We will create special new zones with ultra-low taxes and ultra-low regulations to allow the development of really extraordinary new housing at a proper price, while also bringing jobs and industries to Nevada.
(01:02:08)
Like the movie industry, the technology industry and the massive manufacturing plants from foreign nations will be coming into your state. And that means jobs. And if I pull this off, with the help of your governor, a lot of Hollywood will be moving from California because right now you don’t have the land. Because you don’t have the land. It’s owned by the federal government. We’re going to open up that land to you. You’ll be able to build studio lots and everything else.
(01:02:41)
Millions and millions of Americans will be able to take part in building these clean, safe, and beautiful new communities, reviving the frontier spirit and the American dream, something you don’t hear much about anymore. It’s going to be done right here in Nevada.
(01:02:57)
Next, I will turn the United States into a manufacturing

Donald Trump (01:03:00):

… Manufacturing super power more than it has ever been before. We’re going to bring back the car industry too. We’re going to bring back the car industry, and we’re not going to let China and Mexico sell cars into the United States that are going to just take back our jobs. They’re going to have to pay 100%, maybe a 200% tariff because we don’t want those cars. We want to make our own cars in our country. We’ll do it better than them. Other countries that make us pay a tax to do business with them will be charged the same tax when they send their product into the United States. It will be called the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act. In other words, if China or any other country charges us a 100, 200 or 300% tax, which they actually charge, then we will charge them a 100, 200 or 300% tax in return. Right now we charge them nothing. My message is simple. Make your product here in America and only in America. That’s what we wanted. My plan is that if you open your factory in Nevada, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, or anywhere else in the United States, you don’t pay a tariff. You don’t have to pay anything. All you have to do is pay the workers and the workers are going to be you. But if you move your production outside of the United States and send it back here, you’ll have to pay a massive tariff and we don’t even want your product, even if you pay it.
(01:04:41)
We are going to very quickly supercharge our country. And when I’m back in that beautiful White House, we will pass larger tax cuts for workers and we have a special tax that here is going to do I think quite well, it’s called no tax on tips. No tax on tips. No tax on tips. Did you see when I announced that a long time ago, all of a sudden she announced it and she was met with rebuke. And they can’t do it anyway because they have so much legislation in that make sure that you pay your tax on tips and it didn’t go over too well. But we are going to do it. We’ll get it done fast. They said they were going to cut the school lending. When you borrow money to go to school, they were going to cut it. They were going to cut it down to nothing. Guess what? A big thud. Never happened. It never happened. You know why? Because they’re all talk and no action. And you saw that the other night at the debate.
(01:05:46)
She was all talk, I’m going to do this and I’m going to do that, and then I’m going to cut tax and then I’m going to give you 25,000 per house and then I’m going to go, over and over. And I said very simply at the end of my last little statement, “Why haven’t you done it? You’ve been there for three and a half years. Why haven’t you done it?”
(01:06:06)
Right, Michael? Why haven’t you done it, Michael? Right, Michael? Why haven’t they done it? I said, “We will leave this debate stage, which is just a waste of time anyway. I will go with you to Washington and you can announce the closure of the border.” She doesn’t need a bill. I didn’t have a bill. I said, “We’re closing the border.” We closed the border and we had the greatest chart of all time. You want to put up that chart if you can find it, the border chart, my all-time favorite in the history of charts. Yeah, I love that chart. I’m going to sleep with that chart.
(01:06:42)
That chart saved my life. Can you believe it? Just like that. I said, “Put up the chart.” I went like that to look at it. Ding. That chart, think of it, illegal immigration saved my life. See that? That is the most beautiful document I’ve ever seen. But you see the arrow on the bottom, that’s when I left office. That’s the lowest point in the history of our country for illegal immigrants to come in, but also drugs and everything else that was coming in bad. That point is the lowest. And then as soon as they took over, look, it became a rocket ship. Look at that, like a rocket ship. And our country was destroyed. We had it under control. That’s the lowest point in the history. That was done by border patrol, that chart. But regardless of the numbers, I love that chart. I’m sorry.
(01:07:46)
Additionally, I will fight for and protect social security and Medicare with no cuts, no cuts, and we will have no tax on social security benefits for our seniors. No tax on social security. And then we wheeled out a great one. And I actually think this is going to be fantastic for the country as well as the worker because a lot of people are going to be working overtime. And just yesterday I announced that there will be no taxes on overtime. No taxes on overtime. We will terminate the Green New Scam. I call it the Green New scam, Green New Deal, Green New Scam. It’s greatest scam. You know what they’re going to spend? $97 trillion. Where they going to get that money? That’s more money than every country in the world has. It’s a scam. They were going to spend $97 trillion. And the time is coming up. Remember they said we only have 12 years to live because the environment is going to kill us, right?
(01:09:16)
That time is very close. Somehow I’m not worried. I am worried about nuclear because to be honest with you, we have incompetent people dealing on it. You’re going to end up in World War III. You’re going to have a nuclear holocaust if we’re not careful, these people have no idea. Our people have no idea what they’re doing. And I will keep you out of World War III. I’m the only one that’s going to be able to do it. But we’re going to spend all of that Green New Scam money on roads and bridges and real infrastructure and paying down debt. We’re going to pay down debt and you know we’re going to have growth like this country has never seen before. We’re going to get that debt weighed down. We’re going to get your interest rates way down so you can buy the house, you can have the American dream. I had interest rates at 2% and now they’re 10% and you can’t get the money. You can’t pay the money anyway, too expensive, but you can’t get the money. We’re not going to have fake infrastructure that’s caused massive inflation. The Inflation Reduction Act, which is a fake deal, they actually said about six months ago, they never expected it to do anything for inflation. It was a scam to get more money for the environment. So listen to this, very important I think, you haven’t heard the word environment in seven months. You know why? It doesn’t play. It doesn’t play. We want clean air. We want crystal clear water, beautiful water, and we want an unbelievable country, and we want an economy that’s better than it’s ever been before. The environment isn’t playing. They don’t mention it anymore. With all the money they spent wasted on all this nonsense that they did, the apartment, your windows have to be smaller, preferably don’t have any windows at all. They showed me a building, an ideal building. I said, “What is that? Is it a bunker?”
(01:11:11)
“No, this is a building. It’s a modern building.” It had no windows. Let’s try selling one of those apartments. You have not small windows, you had no windows because it’s good. The sunlight doesn’t go through. Okay, look, she’s laughing. That’s crazy, isn’t it? I don’t know if you’re laughing or crying. I’m sort of crying about it. It’s crazy. These people are crazy. We want a new building and they want to knock down all those beautiful buildings of Manhattan and rebuild them with no windows. We don’t want one building in Manhattan. I will end the chaos in the Middle East and I will settle the war in Ukraine as I will settle that as President-elect.
(01:11:53)
And remember, a vote for comrade Kamala Harris is a vote for war with Russia. Would anybody like to be in war with Russia?

Speaker 4 (01:12:06):

No.

Donald Trump (01:12:06):

If necessary we would, but preferably not, right? Don’t you think? It’s also a vote to bring back the draft? Would anybody like to be drafted in the audience? Because that’s what they’re doing. She’s already talking about bringing back the draft. She wants to bring back the draft and draft your child and put them in a war that should never have happened. Remember, Russia would’ve never attacked Ukraine ever and didn’t for four years. And remember this, when Bush was president, he gave up a lot to Russia. When Barack Obama was president, gave up a lot to Russia. When Biden was president, going to give up the whole thing to Russia it looks like. But when Trump was president, he gave up nothing to Russia. Zero. I gave up nothing. I’m the only one. I’m the only one.
(01:13:07)
And a vote for comrade Kamala Harris is a vote to obliterate Israel and fast. Israel is going to be blown off the face of the earth if she becomes the President of the United States. I hate to say it, I’ve always backed Israel. They will not have a chance if she… She went to a party and said when your prime minister came to the United States and spoke before Congress, which is a big event, she went to a sorority party instead, she found that more important. Ready? Israel will be blown off the face of the earth. It will not exist if she becomes President of the United States.
(01:13:51)
If I become President of the United States, it will go on to glory. But if she becomes President, it will be obliterated. Just remember I said it. A vote for President Donald J. Trump is a vote for prosperity and peace. We will rebuild our cities, including Washington D.C., which is a mess with graffiti all over our beautiful marble buildings, with roads that have potholes all over and medians that are falling down into the gutter. We’re going to make those cities safe, clean, and beautiful again, and we will keep the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency. We’re losing it fast. Nobody else will be able to do that.
(01:14:39)
We’re already missing so many. Russia’s gone. China essentially has gone. China’s the one that wants to take it. North Korea’s got… They’re all getting out. But with me it’s different. I’m going to say, you know what? You want to get out? Yes, we’re decided to get out. We’re going to go with Russia. We’re going to go with China. I said, “That’s okay. Here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to put a 250% tariff on anything you sell us in this country.” And you know what they’re going to do? Sir, we’ve decided that we want to stay in your currency, sir, we’re going to stay in your currency.
(01:15:11)
It won’t happen. It won’t happen. Just like Mexico gave us all those soldiers at our border, everyone said you could never get that. I got it. 28,000 soldiers cash, right? We got 28,000 soldiers to protect our border while we were building the wall. And we got a lot of other things too. I could go over them. I could speak all night long about what we got. What we’re going to get is the greatest country in the history of the world. We’re going to bring it back.
(01:15:41)
And just in closing, this is how we will end the era of inflation, mayhem and misery under Kamala and crooked Joe, and unleash safety, prosperity, and peace for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. Together we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates, and low inflation so that everyone can afford groceries, a car and a home. Very simple, isn’t it?
(01:16:15)
I saw the other night on television, a woman went up to the grocery store and put on the counter three apples. And then she realized she didn’t have enough money for that, and she took one of the apples back. I said, that should never happen in our country. We’re not going to let it happen in our country, while other people get rich and while illegal migrants are staying in luxury hotels and our soldiers, our vets are sleeping on the streets at the base of those hotels, and they’re up in luxury rooms, and they came into our country illegally and many of them are very bad people. We will stop the invasion, end migrant crime, support our police, strengthen our military, build a missile defense shield, and a lot of it is going to be built in Nevada.
(01:17:05)
We will keep critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools, and we will keep men out of women’s sports. I don’t know if you saw the Olympics a couple of weeks ago, a beautiful young Italian boxer, female boxer, and supposed to be very good, and she was fighting a young gentleman or a young woman. You always have to be careful. Your political career could end immediately with the wrong statement. So I’ll say one of each. But she was fighting a person who was a man and transitioned into womanhood. And he looked like if Muhammad Ali in his prime saw him, Muhammad would be afraid.
(01:18:08)
And the fight began, and they’re standing. Henry would know this better than anybody, but they were standing up, and a left jab, it’s just sort of defense. Left jab, left jab. And he hit her with a left jab and she was, oh, oh my God. What? She got hit like a horse. She said, “Somebody hit me. It was a horse.” And then she said, “I’ll try it again.” And she went up and he hit her again with just a left jab. And she said, “Nope, I’m not going to do it.” He ended up winning the gold medal, went through the boxers like nothing.
(01:18:43)
There were two people in women’s boxing that transitioned. Both of them happened to win a gold medal. Are you surprised? Are you surprised by that? Are you surprised? No, I’m not either right? I’m not surprised. We will defend the Second Amendment, restore free speech, and we will secure our elections. We’re going to have to secure our elections because they cheat so badly. Everyone will prosper. Every family will thrive, and every day we will be filled, you know the word they used, with joy. So I’m not going to use that word if you don’t mind, but opportunity and hope. We’re going to be filled with ambition. We’re going to go out and love getting up every morning and going to work and making a lot of money.
(01:19:31)
But for that to happen, we must defeat comrade Kamala Harris, a radical left lunatic. And we must stop her country destroying liberal agenda once and for all. If they get in, we’re never going to be able to turn this country around. It’s going to be Venezuela on steroids. You’re never going to be able to do it. So get everyone you know to vote. We want a landslide that is too big to rig, too big to rig.
(01:19:59)
On November 5th, we will save our economy. We will rescue our middle class. We will reclaim our sovereignty and restore our borders like they have not been restored in a long time. We will put America first and we will take back our country. Together we will make America powerful again. Make America wealthy again. Make America healthy again. Make America strong again. Make America proud again. Make America safe again. Make America free again. We will make America great again. Thank you very much [inaudible 01:20:43]. Thank you.

Donald Trump (02:31):

This is a very rambunctious crowd. This is a rambunctious crowd. Well, hello Tucson. It’s great to be with you. I love this place. We’ve been very successful here, as you know, and I’m thrilled to be back in the great state of Arizona with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. This is a nice group. I like it. Look at all those people. Wow.
(03:06)
As everyone saw two nights ago, we had a monumental victory over comrade Kamala Harris in the presidential debate. We won big with independent voters, moderates, Republicans, and working people all across this nation, putting forward a clear vision to very simply make America great again.
(03:37)
Meanwhile, Kamala Harris showed up, spewing empty rhetoric, the same old lies, meaningless platitudes. Offering no plans, no policies, and no details whatsoever, nothing. The two anchors, David Muir and Lindsey Davis sat there and only corrected me on things where I was right, but didn’t correct Kamala on Project 25 that I knew nothing about, on the bloodbath hoax that has been totally debunked, which had to do with the automobile industry that is going to be dying. It’s dying under this administration. They’re all going to be shipped out to China and everybody in the automobile industry, making, manufacturing automobiles, vote for Trump. We’re going to bring back that industry. These people are killing it. She talked about knowing it was all false. She talked about the Charlottesville hoax and these people did nothing about it, which has been totally debunked, as they say by Snopes and Snoops and everybody else. Hey, go look it up. Go to Snoops, whatever the hell that is. No, I hear that’s a liberal site and they came out totally in favor of me. That’s got to be a bad thing. But they said they gave you total phony stories. Kamala Harris said that no state allows abortion in the ninth month, which is a complete and total lie. They do. They do.
(05:11)
And even after birth, in some cases. She claimed, I want to monitor women’s pregnancies. I don’t want to do that. I don’t want to. It’s a total lie. I don’t want to do that. Women, I won’t be following you around to the hospital monitoring. No, she made it up. She’s a liar. She doesn’t work at McDonald’s. She said she worked at McDonald’s, right? Right? She worked at McDonald’s and she was working so hard. There’s only one problem. She didn’t work at McDonald’s. She’s a liar. Liar.
(05:50)
She claimed that I want to deny people IVF treatment when in fact I want to require insurance companies to pay for, and I came out totally in favor of IVF. That’s fertilization for the men in the audience. I wish we got a lot of tough ones here. She claims she doesn’t want to ban fracking when she said repeatedly over a ten-year period, I will not have fracking. Then about a little while ago, she goes, “I’d love to have fracking.” Her pollster came back and said, this is not good. In Pennsylvania, you want to ban fracking? That’s not so good. That’s a big part of what they do, right?
(06:32)
And she came back. She came back. All of a sudden she thought fracking was wonderful. Here’s what happens with all of these things. Right after the election, she goes back to where she was. She claims she doesn’t support mass gun confiscation when in fact she supported it entirely. And through her entire career, think of that. She wants to confiscate your guns. Does anybody in the audience have a gun? Raise your hand. Would you mind if this lunatic knocked on your door? “Hello, I’d like to take away your gun. Is that all right?” Especially the women won’t allow it. They’re not going to allow it. That’s unbelievable. What is that? About 100% of the audience. Let’s go. Does anybody in the audience not have a gun? Wait, there’s somebody. So if you want to keep your gun, we don’t have to go through the rest of it. You want to keep your gun? Vote for Trump. Okay? I promise. But she did something even worse than that. You know what it is? She was the leader of a thing called a movement, defund the police. How about that? She was the leader of the movement to defund the police. Now, think of it. Anybody that wants to defund the police, that’s called she’s down and dirty left. Okay, that’s down and dirty. If she’s in there for a week at defund the police, we don’t want her to be president. We don’t want her for anything, frankly. But all of a sudden, all of a sudden she says, no, I never said it. She actually goes around saying she never said it, but we’ve got like 10 years of tapes where she’s saying it with the guns, with the fracking, with everything we mentioned. She had many years of tapes, but the public was not fooled. They saw right through it.
(08:53)
Kamala’s lies, an unprecedented partisan interference of two low-life anchors. Their low-lives. For them to do what they did, and they wouldn’t correct her on Project 25, I don’t know what the hell it is. I purposely have not read it. I could, but I don’t want to because they never had my authorization. And for them to allow her to get away with me everything I said. Well, we don’t think it’s true. Like the crime statistics, the FBI didn’t report the most crime-ridden cities. They didn’t do it. They left out large numbers of areas where they had a lot of crime, so the numbers came in. They weren’t up too much, and if anybody in this audience doesn’t think there’s more crime now, there’s so much more crime now. But they gave false and fraudulent numbers. They did it with something else. 818,000 jobs. Think of it.
(09:49)
They said they had 818,000 jobs that didn’t exist, so your jobs numbers look better, but now they had to do, what happened is they were taken away by a leaker. Usually, I don’t like leakers, but I like this particular leaker, whoever it was. But when a prizefighter loses a fight, you’ve seen a lot of fights. The first words out of that fighter’s mouth is, “I want to rematch. I want to rematch,” and that’s what she said. I want to rematch Polls clearly show that I won the debate against comrade Kamala Harris.
(10:28)
And as you probably know, because when you say Harris, does anybody know who Harris is? No. Kamala is a very different kind of a word. Nice name, very nice name, but you know her as Kamala, you don’t know her as Harris. When you say Harris, everyone says, “Who the hell is that?” Right? But she immediately called for a second debate, which means that she was like a prizefighter that lost a fight. We had two debates though. I had a debate with Crooked Joe Biden, right? And I had another debate with her. She and Crooked Joe have destroyed our country with millions of criminals and mentally deranged people pouring into the USA, totally unchecked, un-vetted, and with inflation, bankrupting our middle class. It has gotten bad. Everyone knows this, and all of the other problems caused by Kamala and Joe. It was discussed in great detail during the first debate with Joe and the second debate with Comrade Harris.
(11:33)
She was a no-show at the Fox debate. Fox invited her. She was a no-show. I sat with the great Sean Hannity. Does anybody know Sean Hannity? Good man. He’s a good man. And I said, where is she? She didn’t show. So we did a town hall and he got great ratings on that town hall. I’ll tell you right now, got really great… Led all of television for the week. It’s not bad, right? Simple town hall. It turned out to be a town hall from what it was supposed to be, but she didn’t show up and refused also to do NBC and CBS. She went over to ABC, which in my opinion has taken a big hit because these two people were bad news. They kept screaming at me. I said, “Why are you screaming?” I’m saying myself. I’m looking at him, I always liked him. I’m not going to watch him anymore. I’m not going to watch him because he’s not legit what he did. I’m not going to watch him, and his hair’s not as good as it used to be.
(12:39)
Kamala should focus on what she should have done during the last almost four-year period. She kept complaining, well, you know when I’m in, I’m going to do this and I’m going to do that. And at the end of the debate I said, why don’t you just do it? You could leave right now. Why don’t you do it? I’m going to do this and then I’m going to do that, and then I’m going to do this and that and that. Remember at the convention when she went out and they nominated her, even though she got no votes, they nominated her? No, she came in last place in the primaries, right? And then she said, “Donald Trump is a threat to democracy.” No, she’s a threat to democracy. She is a threat to democracy. But do you remember when she went out and she said thank you.
(13:28)
Do you remember that? It was the weirdest thing. Am I wrong? They were saying, JD and I are weird. No, we’re very solid people. She’s weird. That vice president of hers is really weird. He’s really… That was a soundbite. They said, oh, he’s weird. In other words, they gave it to their friends in the fake news. Weird. It’s something I’ve never called. I’ve been called a lot of bad things, but not weird. But she went out and the people were applauding herself and she goes, “Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.” I think she went nuts. There was something wrong with her, but I was very happy because I got the endorsement of the vice president’s family and I got the endorsement of the vice president’s brother and even sent me a contribution, and I was very happy because Barack Hussein Obama, his brother, as you know, endorsed me, so his brother endorsed me.
(14:45)
That’s not easy. So we have the endorsement of President Obama’s brother. We have the endorsement of the brother of the future vice president. He better not win. If he ever won, this country will be in bad shape. It’s already in bad shape. Three and a half years of what they’ve done to this country, especially… We’re laughed at all over the world. We would’ve never had the Russia-Ukraine problem. We would’ve never had October 7th, Israel, the attack on Israel. None of these things… And we wouldn’t have had inflation, and we wouldn’t have had that horrible… The way we pulled out in Afghanistan was so horrible. None of those things would’ve happened. We would’ve had a much different country and we wouldn’t have 21 million people in our country right now that shouldn’t be here. That I can tell you. So because we’ve done two debates and because they were successful, there will be no third debate. It’s too late anyway, the voting’s already begun. You got to go out and vote. We got to vote. This is going to be the most important vote in the history of our country. It’ll be the most important. People said that I was angry at the debate. I was angry. And yes, I am angry because he allowed 21 million illegal aliens invading our communities. Many of them are criminals, many are criminals. I’m angry.

Crowd (16:32):

USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.

Donald Trump (16:51):

They said he’s an angry person. No, they’re destroying our country. I don’t like… She’s smiling all practice, right? Did you see her? She’s like this. We’re talking about a border invasion, the likes of which no country has ever suffered, and she’s like this, but I am angry about Venezuelan gangs taking over Aurora, Colorado and illegal Haitians, and he came in illegal Haitian migrants taking over a beautiful place. It was so beautiful. Springfield, Ohio. I was there. I campaigned there a while ago. Springfield, it was so beautiful. Now it’s just… What a place. Can you imagine? You have this small little community. All of a sudden you have 20,000 illegals in your community. Nobody knows where they come from. I’m angry about young American girls being raped and sodomized and murdered by savage criminal aliens.
(17:55)
I’m angry about rampant inflation destroying our middle class, and the American people are also very angry about that and every other thing that we’ve had to endure for three and a half years. That’s why 54 days from now, we are going to tell Harris that we’ve had enough. Our country can’t take it anymore. We’re going to go Comrade Kamala Harris, you’ve done a horrible job. You’ve been the worst vice president in the history of our country. You had no chance of getting this position. You shouldn’t have had it. You got no votes. Whether you like Biden or not, he got 14 million votes. He had none, not one. We’re going to go “Comrade, you’re fired. Get out, get out. Get out.”
(18:47)
Thank you. Thank you everybody. So thank you. Wasn’t the Apprentice a great show though? Do you think if I didn’t do the Apprentice, because that’s a big question because a lot of people in Hollywood are blaming themselves for this, saying if we didn’t do the Apprentice, he wouldn’t be… But they all vote for me. You know that? Because they want to pay low taxes. They talk about, no, we don’t like Trump, but when they go to vote, they go… Anybody watch? It’s true. They want low taxes, no crime, great schools, strong military. They don’t want a border invasion. They don’t want people pouring across the border illegally from prisons and places.

Donald Trump (20:00):

So they go in, they say, “Yeah, no, no, I’m not for Trump at all. I will never vote for him.” Then they go in. It’s true. And then they go out and they do exit polls. And in 2016, and in 2020, where I got many more millions more votes, by the way, I hate to say that. They say, “Oh, that’s a conspiracy theorist.” No, it’s called, I got more votes than any sitting president in the history of our country. And they said, “We lost.” I was told if I got 63 million votes, which is what I got in 2016, you can’t lose. Just get 63. I got close to 12 million more votes than that, and we lost. But we didn’t lose, and we’re never going to let that happen again in this country. We’re never going to let that happen. We can’t let that happen again.
(21:03)
But when they had exit polls 2016, and they said, “Oh, he’s getting killed in the exit polls,” and I remember NBC and that stupid ABC that did this horrible debate, those two people should be fired as an anchor. A couple of more years they’ll be fired. And she was nasty. She looked at me with hatred in her eyes and him, he’s a nice guy. I mean, they were told to do it by George Slopidopoulos, who’s in the group, right? George Slopidopoulos, but on the exit polls. So people are walking out and they’re saying, “Would like to know something, sir? Who’d you vote for?” And they’d say, “Cricket, Hillary or Trump, right?” But so many of them, almost 50% said, “None of your business who we voted for.” They have a tougher word, two words, not like Biden one word, and then he gives two. Two words. They begin with the letters F-U. That’s what they say to the people. I would never say, because we have a lot of young people here, my audience, they’ve gotten younger and younger, do you notice that?
(22:20)
Younger. Don’t worry, I still like the old people the best, I don’t care. I don’t care. Let that cost me. All these young people let that cost me the election. I still like the old people the best. Got to stay with the people that got you there, right? I love what we are doing for the old people you’ll hear. But so that was the two words, but I don’t want to use those words. So they said, “None of your business,” which is not really what they said. And they walked out, and everybody said, “Trump is finished. He’s not getting the numbers.” Because in the past nobody said that. They’d say, “I’m voting for this one, or that one.” There were no people that wouldn’t say. They’d just say who they voted for. So what they did, thank you darling, thank you. So what they did, she keeps saying, “I love you. I love you,” right in the middle of my punch lines.
(23:23)
So they always say one or the other, and I had one analyst who was very smart, but I was called by a person at Fox. “Sir, I’m sorry, sir. Doesn’t look good. It doesn’t look good.” And they say this four o’clock in the afternoon because they’ve interviewed all these people, and another one would call me. They were actually happy. Most of them were happy. Some were really sad though. A lot of the people were really sad. So it came out, “This is going to be a very short evening for Donald Trump.” They were so happy. Martha Raddatz was actually crying at the end when I won. She was crying. You don’t think she’s biased, do you? Martha Raddatz also of ABC. ABC is the worst of the group, by the way, I have to tell you. They’re all bad. But the worst is ABC, and they proved that with the worst two anchors anybody’s ever seen on this thing. They were the worst. At least they shouldn’t have been so obvious, right? Libby.
(24:24)
So anyway, I walked out and the people walked in and I was getting calls that thousands of people all over the country. “I’m sorry sir, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.” Then one guy calls me up who’s a political brilliant guy, and he said, “Sir.” And I don’t think I’ve ever told this story. I went to see our great First Lady and I said, “Darling,” I got home from Michigan. I was in Michigan last stop, and I got home from Michigan at four o’clock in the morning. I had a rally. We had 42,000 people at one o’clock. I did seven rallies. I started in Florida. I went from Florida where it was 88 to Michigan where it was 20 degrees below here. I said, “If you don’t catch a pneumonia in this business, you’re never going to catch a pneumonia, right?” But I went to our great First Lady, and I felt okay. It was amazing because the athletes, they say, “I left it on the field. I left it all on field.” Well, I did because I did seven major rallies for two days, seven each. Who the hell could do that?
(25:38)
People were saying nobody else could do it. You think Biden could do it? I don’t think so. I don’t think Biden would do seven. I don’t know if he’d do one. He’d do one that would last for about three minutes. Now, we did major rallies speak for an hour, hour and a half, sometimes go to the next day. We get all up and down, we went off everywhere, but this one guy calls up. So everyone had called me. I had a young gentleman in my family came to see me, “Sir, you haven’t lost, but it’s not looking good.” This is at five o’clock in the afternoon or an election day. And I said, “It’s all right. Don’t worry about it.” So I went to see my wife and I said, “I don’t feel the way I thought I’d feel. I thought I’d be devastated, but I left it all out and if we don’t make it, but it looks not good.” She said, “Does it look like you’re not going to win?” I said, “It really looks that way. And we’ll get by it. It’s one of those things. But I was very disappointed.”
(26:36)
But it wasn’t like, “Gee, if only I worked a little bit harder,” because humanly, you couldn’t work harder. Then about 5:30, I get a call from a very smart political guy, and he goes, “Sir, I’d like to congratulate you.” I said, “On what?” He said, “You won this election.” And I said, “What do you mean I won the election? I was told by every pundit that I lost the election.” He said, “No, you won the election. 95% sure, because we’ve never seen so many people leaving an election that said, it’s none of your business.” Meaning, you know what? None of your business, we’ve never seen that before. A massive number, almost 50% who’d you vote for? None of your business. He said, every single one of those people belong to you. There are people whether we like it or not.
(27:43)
And he said, “You’re going to win Florida. You’re going to win Georgia. You’re going to win all these states. I think you’re going to win. Because normally it would be like 5%, 10% might say you’ve got 50%. There’s never been anything like that, and I believe all those votes are your votes.” I said, “Well, all right, good.” And then all of a sudden, they came out and the rest is history, right? The polls close, and they started with Donald Trump. So Florida closed at eight o’clock or whatever, and within seconds, seconds it closed. Florida polls have closed. Donald Trump has won the great state of Florida. Donald Trump has won the great state of Georgia. Donald Trump, and went all the way up the East Coast, all over the place, and we ended up winning. That was quite a day, wasn’t it though?
(28:36)
And then we did much better the second time. Much better, much, much better then. But this is going to be the time because we’ve never had the enthusiasm that we have now. We’ve never had it because now you see how bad they’re doing. You see how bad. Before, there was nothing to judge, right? Because I was the president. We did great. We had a great economy. We got hit with COVID, which is China, and people didn’t really think in terms of that. It was a terrible thing. But we got hit. The whole world got hit. $62 trillion and millions of deaths all over the world, the world got hit. Everybody, Abe in Japan was devastated by it. So many people were devastated. Good people, very good people, great people actually. But what happened was amazing. And now they see how bad a job they’ve done. Think of it, the inflation, the economy, everything is terrible.
(29:35)
We’re not respected in the world. A war that would’ve never happened with Russia and Ukraine started. A situation in Israel would’ve never ever happened, never ever happened. And that’s a disaster. The whole Middle East is blowing up. Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary said, “You got to bring Trump back or this whole world is going to blow up.” So we’re going to do things. But I will tell you, 16 was great, 20 was better. And this one blows both of them away because we’ve never seen the enthusiasm. Look at this crowd. We’ve never seen the enthusiasm. So I’m pleased to be joined this afternoon by the next senator from Arizona, and we’re going to call her a different name. I haven’t told her this, but she may be angry. She may never speak to me again, but I’m going to give her a different name. She’s very strong in the border. She knows the problems that you’re having in your state. Arizona’s got tremendous problems with illegals coming in from all over the world and just pouring in.
(30:48)
And by the way, taking Hispanic jobs, taking African American jobs, taking people that have been here a long time, citizens, the jobs, but she’s been very strong on it. And I just realized because it’s gotten so bad, when you look at Springfield, Ohio, when you look at Aurora in Colorado. I feel so sorry for this guy. He has no idea what to do. He’s a Democrat, so he has no idea what to do about it. He’s devastated. He’s afraid to do anything. But if you look, the Venezuelans have taken over. I mean, and they walk in with guns, the biggest guns that I’ve ever seen. They had guns that were supreme. They call them supreme guns, AK- 47 Supreme. They have stuff. I don’t know where the hell they get this stuff. They come in, they’ve taken over buildings, they’re in the real estate business, let’s put it that way.
(31:41)
And that’s just the beginning. It’s going to get really bad. And you have a sheriff with a deputy or something, and you got 30 guys with AK-47s and all these horrible, I mean, big stuff. And they’re taking over. And let me tell you, we’re not letting it happen. This woman is very strong. She’s running against a weak person. She’s running against a guy who voted 100% of the time when he was voting, he voted 100% of the time just about, for crooked Joe Biden. He’s weakened the border. He wants to have open borders, and he’s going to go back to that. I don’t even know what he’s saying now. It doesn’t matter because when they’re for open borders, they’re never going to change. There’s stupid people because it’s going to ruin our country. But she’s tough in the border. So if you don’t mind, I’m going to call her Border Carry Lake from now on Border Carry Lake. She’s a fantastic person. I’ve known her a long time. I was one of the early people that endorsed her, and I’ll tell you, she is tough, tough, tough on the border. And that’s taken over. I think in 2016, I won maybe because of the border, I don’t know the economy, the border, whatever, but a lot. But the border, and I fixed it. And in 2020, I couldn’t talk about the border. My people would say, “Sir, you’re wasting your time talking about the border.” I say, “Well, wait a minute. I fixed the border. I want to talk about it.” Nobody wants to hear it. I made that border so strong and I couldn’t talk about it, but let me give you the bad news. That border was 1,100th of what it is now. That border, when I took over, it was bad, but it was just a fraction of what now is horrible and dangerous, and we’re ruining our country.
(33:55)
We’re destroying. So Carrie told me that she’s going to be focusing on the border, border border, right? And she is. You’re going to get it fixed, right? You’re going to get it fixed? And she’s going to get it done. She’s tough. She’s tough on the border though. It bothered her from the first day you started having the problem. She would’ve done it as governor, and that race was a very sad race, she did great, but she would’ve done that as governor. But she’ll do it even more so in a sense as Senator, and she’ll fix your border and she’ll be working with me on doing it.
(34:39)
Border Carrie Lake. thank you, thank you, Border Carrie. I don’t know. I’m giving her a tag. When I give people tags, it stays. But that’s a good one. She’s going to be great. She’ll be great. And the guy, honestly, he is nothing. This guy that’s running, he’s got nothing going, and he couldn’t care less about the border. You need help. You can’t let this happen. Also, a candidate who’s a great person who I endorsed, he just did a fantastic job of everything he’s done now, he’s running, as you know, for Congress. He’s doing really well. One in the primaries, tough races, one in the primaries. He’s somebody that really seems to be able to get the job done like very few people that we all know. But Abe Hamadeh is here someplace.
(35:38)
He’s a tough cookie. He’s a tough cookie. And I can really name him border also, but how many names can I use? But you’re a big border guy. You want to see a strong border, and you’ll win on the border. You will. And Carry will win on the border. You don’t have to talk about anything else because everything else we’ll fix, we’ll take care of it. We’ll bring your interest rates down, we’ll do everything, but you’ll win on the border. If you guys just focus on that, you don’t have to talk about much else. There’s a man that’s going to help you a lot on the border too. He’s a fantastic friend of mine. Art Del Cueto, the head of Border Patrol. Where is Art? He’s a good guy too. He’s been my friend along with that couple of our other friends that for a long time, and they endorsed me years ago, and they’ve never taken it back. And I saw that Art and his people go on television, they say, “There’s only one man going to be able to do this border,” and I appreciate it, Art. We won’t forget it, Art. Thank you, man. Thank you. Thank everybody else too, Art. Appreciate it. And Arizona Republican Party Chairwoman, Gina Swoboda. Gina, she is great. She is a winner. Thank you very much, Gina. I’d like to thank all of the police I met backstage and border patrol people. That’s great to stand up for them. They go through a lot. That’s great. Look at that. Look at that, Art. That’s great. And they deserve it too. You don’t know how much respect we all have for you in the job you do, and it’s dangerous work, and they want to really do the job.
(37:52)
They’re stopped from doing their job. They want to do their job. They want to work. It’s more dangerous. It’s harder, but they want to save our country. These people are incredible, I’ll tell you. As the people of Arizona understand better than anyone else under Kamala Harris, our country is under a thing called invasion. Did you ever hear the word invasion? Just like a military, it’s like a military invasion. We’re being conquered and we are being occupied by a foreign element. And if you think about it, China has a five-million- man army, mostly man in that case, I can tell you. But they have a five-million-person army, and we have 21 million people coming this period of time, 21 million people over the period of the last few years. Think of it. They have a five-million. That’s a big army. And we have 21 million people here. So cut out half. That means you have 10 million people and they have guns. You just see that. If you look at Colorado, take a look at Aurora. They have guns that are the most sophisticated guns anywhere in the world, high-powered stuff. And you say to yourself, so if you cut the number in half, 10 million people, and cut that number in half, 5 million, that’s the size of China and what they have as an army. It’s pretty dangerous stuff. We got to get them the hell out of here. As discussed in the debate, not only is Comrade Kamala allowing a legal aliens to stampede across our border, but she is flying them here from other countries. No, no. Remember when their poles were crashing a few months ago, she said, “Oh, oh, oh.” And they issued some order or I don’t know what it was because it stopped it a little bit, slowed it down a little bit, but it doesn’t mean he knows. He’s laughing. He knows because they’ll

Donald Trump (40:00):

… slow down a little bit. Then they’ll say, “Oh, look at the numbers,” but they have a problem. They didn’t include the airplane numbers. They fly them in by the tens of thousands. Think of it. They’re trying to say they’re into the border and yet they have airplanes, beautiful airplanes, going and picking them up and dropping them into the middle of our country. It means we really have 50 border states. No, they’re dropping them into the middle of our country all over the place. They fly them in. Think of that. They fly them in by jets. They’re flying in all the time. And Art, they don’t count those numbers, do they? They don’t talk about them when they fly in. And then they have a special app. They have an app where the cartels are allowed to use the app to get their people in.
(40:45)
Do you believe this? It’s an app for cartels, so the illegal cartels, that are among the richest people in the world, by the way. We think we have a lot of wealth. Well, take that 400, the Forbes 400 or whatever it is. Forbes isn’t doing so well anymore, but take whatever the hell 400 they have. These guys would qualify. In many cases, they’d be a hell of a lot richer. The cartels are using this app, think of it, to bring thousands and thousands of people here illegally. Over the past three and a half years, the Harris-Biden administration has resettled a half a million illegal immigrants from the failed state of Haiti, which is a totally failed country, very sad situation, into American communities, including over 200,000 who Kamala has illegally flown into the United States by airplane. Think of that. And they’re coming out of Haiti and they’re coming out of other failed countries at levels that nobody has ever seen before.
(41:46)
In addition to Aurora, Colorado, there’s a place called Springfield, Ohio that you’ve been reading about. 20,000 illegal Haitian immigrants have descended upon the town of 58,000 people destroying their entire way of life. This was a beautiful community, and now it’s horrible what’s happened. Enrollment are the state’s. Medicaid and food assistance programs have soared, motor vehicle accidents have skyrocketed. Recording of 911 calls even show residents are reporting that the migrants are walking off with the town’s geese. They take into geese. You know, where the geese are in the park, in the lake, and even walking off with their pets. My dog’s been taken. My dog’s been stolen. This can only happen. These people are the worst. I’m telling you, Biden and Kamala, this is the worst combination in the history of our country. The only one happy is Jimmy Carter because he’s no longer referred to as the worst president in history. Not even close. Likewise, a small 4,000-person, town of Charleroi, Pennsylvania. Have you heard of it? Charleroi. What a beautiful name, but it’s not so beautiful now. Has experienced a 2000% increase in the population of Haitian migrants under Kamala Harris. So Pennsylvania, remember this when you have to go to vote, okay? Just remember this. 2000% increase. This is a small town. All of a sudden, they got thousands of people. The schools are scrambling to hire translators for the influx of students who don’t speak not a word of English, costing local taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars, and the town is virtually bankrupt. This flood of illegal aliens is also bringing massive crime to the town and every place near it. Earlier this year in Massachusetts, one of the Haitian illegals who Kamala flew into America was charged with raping a 15-year-old girl and badly, badly hurting that girl. Also in Massachusetts, a Haitian migrant was charged with raping a pregnant woman and beating her very badly.
(44:13)
Yet another Haitian migrant who she imported was arrested for molesting a 10-year-old child who lived right next door. The child next door was badly, badly hurt. In New York this year, an illegal brought in through Kamala’s migrant phone app was charged with savagely murdering his two roommates. He had two roommates set up by the people that set that up in this country. “Welcome,” they go. “Welcome. What would you like?” “Oh, I’d like to have a nice room.” “Okay, we’ll give you two roommates.” Viciously stabbing them to death. But these are just a few of the many, many stories. There are hundreds and hundreds, there are thousands of stories. They’re coming in from all over the world, from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums, and many tourists. Numbers that we have never seen before. You’ve never seen these numbers before, Art. You never saw these numbers before, have you? You’ve never seen anything like this. This is unique. At least with you, it’s unique. We cannot let this happen to our country. It will not end well unless Donald J. Trump is elected the 47th President of the United States.
(45:24)
Thank you. We’ll get them out. We’ll get it ready. We’ll bring back our country in many ways. That’s one way, but to me that’s one of the most important ways. Well, we’ll also stop World War III. That’s an important way. There has never been an invasion like this in any country. There’s never been an invasion like this. There’s never been a border like this. No matter where you go in the world throughout history, there’s never been a border like this, and the fake news media will correct me if that’s the case. I’ll tell you what, there’s never been anything like what’s happening to our country in history, because no leader of a country is as stupid as the two people that are leading our country.
(46:24)
In fact, our leadership, if you think about it, is nonexistent. Where’s Biden? Do you think he lies awake at night, turning and tossing on finding a way to stop the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine? I don’t think so. He hasn’t spoken to Putin in years. I will get that war settled as President- elect. And I’m telling you, this is true. Kamala, a committed Marxist – you know her father’s a Marxist professor – will be far worse than Crooked Joe Biden. She’s going to be worse, because he doesn’t really believe it. She does. She does believe it, and she’ll go back to no fracking and all the other things we talked about. She’ll go back to them on day one. But on day one of my administration, I will stop this invasion. I will seal the border. I will end the Harris migrant flights, and I will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country.
(47:47)
We have no choice. We have no choice. Thank you.

Multiple speakers (47:48):

USA, USA, USA-

Donald Trump (48:12):

Thank you. We will not allow our country to be destroyed. They’re destroying our country. We’ll get the criminals out and we will not let them back into our country. We’re not going to let them back in. They’re staying out. The other countries are doing this. You know that? And this is all over the world. This isn’t just South America. This isn’t Honduras alone and Guatemala, El Salvador, Mexico. This is all over the world. The Congo in Africa comes. A lot of people coming from the Congo. But Africa, they’re coming, Asia, the Middle East and South America, but they’re coming from all over the world. And coming from prisons, and they’re coming from jails. We’re not going to let this happen to our country. Another terrible effect of the Harris migrant invasion, and she’s the one that wanted it more than Biden. Biden didn’t know what the hell was happening. He said, “That sounds like a nice idea.” Is that it is driving housing costs through the roof. You know that, right? You’re affected by that. Fewer than 5 million new houses were built in the last three years, yet Kamala Harris has imported 21 million illegal aliens who are now disproportionately occupying lower-income rental properties. So think of it. We built 5 million units, but think of this. They started in a little community where they did 5,000. That was quite nice. Then they go to 5 million units, but we have 21 million people came in. None of them are going to be paying a lot of rent. I can tell you that. Because a lot of those people are people that shouldn’t be here. Some should, but a lot of them are people that shouldn’t be here. As just one example, a vivid one, look at the explosion in rent in Springfield, Ohio, where Kamala has resettled the 20,000 Haitians. There’s a chart up here someplace.
(50:10)
I don’t like that as much as the chart that I had in Butler, PA. That was my favorite chart. That was my favorite chart. We still have that. That was a great beautiful chart there. The red, the yellow, and the blue. That is going to be my all time favorite chart. I don’t care what chart I look at over the years. I will sleep with that chart every single night. But look at the numbers and look at the way those lines are. They’re totally out of control. When I return to the White House, we will require that all companies receiving federal housing subsidies to verify citizenship. We’re going to verify citizenship. We’re going to make sure that it’s a legal residency, and as a condition of their rental agreements, they’re going to have to do all of it. Taxpayers will not subsidize apartment rentals for illegal aliens, and we will not permit illegals to drive up the cost for Americans in need.
(51:42)
In addition, I will ban all mortgages for illegal aliens. You can’t have it. Now, in California, under Gavin Newsom, you know they want to give illegals mortgages. They want all illegals. How about all illegals get a mortgage? You don’t get any mortgage. They do. This is the first part of my plan to restore housing affordability in America. Kamala Harris is killing the American dream, but with your vote this November, it’s going to be the most important election ever in the history of our country. We are going to bring back the American dream bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. We’re going to bring it back.
(52:34)
Under my leadership, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world. Before the pandemic, we raised real median household income by $7,684, a record per family. We achieved the lowest Hispanic American unemployment rate and the lowest Hispanic American poverty rate in the history of our country. And Hispanic American household wealth and homeownership reached the highest level ever recorded. Thank you very much. I like you. But now Arizonans are experiencing an affordability crisis, and this is a crisis of historic proportions. Do you agree? You know that. You know what’s going on in this area in particular. Today, not a single major city in Arizona is considered affordable, not one. When I was president, nearly two thirds of the homes in Phoenix were considered affordable for families making the median income. Think of it, two thirds, and now it’s none.
(53:38)
Today, the number of homes that are affordable for those middle class families is down to a number that you don’t even want to hear. It’s almost nothing. Here are the other pillars of my plan to end this nightmare and help millions of Arizona families afford the house of your dreams. We will rapidly reduce inflation by slashing energy costs. We’re going to slash energy costs, taxes, and we are going to slash regulations. By quickly defeating inflation, we will in turn bring interest rates down very fast. When I was president, interest rates were hovering around 2%. You got a mortgage? Oh, look at that guy, the big guy. Stand up. Look at the shoulders on him. You got a mortgage at around 2%. That’s right. You. Who else looks like that? Nobody going to mess with him, right? Nobody going to mess with that guy.
(54:36)
But he was happy when I said, “You got a good mortgage.” I can see a lot of other people did. Today, the mortgage rates are at 10%, 11%, 12%. You can’t get the money. We’re going to bring it down very fast. We’re going to bring energy down. We will drive down the rate so you will be able to pay 2% again, and we will be able to finance or refinance your homes drastically at much lower costs. You do a refinancing, or a financing if you’re lucky. This step alone will save Arizona families between 800 and $1000 per month on their mortgage for a typical home. Under Comrade Kamala Harris, your electricity bills here in Arizona Rose an estimated almost 100%. It’s the largest increase anywhere in the country. Did you know that? Congratulations. You’re number one in the… Oh, that’s right. That’s not good. No, congratulations. You’re number one in the country for the increase in your electric bills. What the hell is going on?
(55:42)
As president, I will end the Harris-Biden war on American energy on day one, and under my plan, it is my goal to cut your energy costs by 50% in the first year. 50. 50%. Remember, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other nation in the world. More than Saudi Arabia. More than Russia. We will slash the cost of heating, air conditioning, gasoline, electricity, and by bringing down the price of energy, we will defeat inflation and reduce the prices which are through the roof right now. People can’t afford cereal. You got to see, it’s so sad when you see people being interviewed and they buy three apples and they walk away from the cashier and they bring an apple back because they can’t afford it, and it happens all the time.
(56:34)
Upon taking office, I will also sign an executive order directing the immediate termination of every single unnecessary rule that is impeding housing construction and driving up the cost of housing. Government regulations are responsible for more than 25% of the cost of a new single-family home and 40% of the cost of multifamily homes. Think of it. Regulations costing 40% of the cost, and it takes you years to get it done. We’re going to end all of that. I have been a builder my entire life. I understand the problem and I will fix it. I know how to fix it. Nobody else is going to figure it out. My objective will be to cut the cost of building a new home by 30 to 50%, and much of it is regulation.
(57:27)
And in addition, we will open, and this is your great people in this state that are asking me so many times, so many people are asking me to do this. We will open up new tracts of federal land for large-scale housing construction so that we can get housing on the market. About 18% of all land in Arizona is owned by the Bureau of Land Mismanagement. It’s actually management. Mismanagement. I have to be careful because with the fake news media, I can go a whole speech. I can go a whole speech, stand up here largely without a teleprompter. I don’t read them most of the time, because you’d find it very boring when you read teleprompters. Run, spot, run. Remember I said that? But I could go a whole day. I could go stand up here, talk to you for two hours. If I mispronounce one word, like I called mismanagement, I said the Bureau of Mismanagement, well, I was kidding. They won’t say that.
(58:37)
They’ll say, “He’s cognitively impaired.” Oh, it’s true. Watch. That’ll be all over television. Sarcasm for me is the worst thing possible, because when I’m being sarcastic or say something kiddingly, like even the other night I was talking about how much we won by a certain election a few years ago, and I jokingly said, “They won by just a little smidgen.” “Is it true that you think the election was close because you said just…” I said, “Yeah, I was being sarcastic.” It’s not good. When I imitate Joe Biden not being able to find his way off the stage, which happens all the time. No, it happens all the time. I get decimated by the fake news media and sometimes they say, “Look, he can’t find his way off the stage either.”
(59:32)
You have these stages. They have four or five stairs, usually. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Well, is this a government-owned building? They have usually more stairs. But when I do an imitation of that, they will sometimes say, because I called up our great First Lady, I said, “How great was my speech tonight?” Because they’re always on television. You know why? Because they get good ratings. I said, “How great was my speech tonight? Did you see the size

Donald Trump (01:00:00):

To the crowd. Oh, and by the way, her crowds are zero. She’s got no crowds. They bus the people in. They pay buses to bring people. Nobody here rode in on a bus, I guarantee you that, unless you own it. I said, “Did you see how great my speech was tonight, darling? How great?” She said, “Well, it was good.” I said, “What’d you think?” “Well, I didn’t like your hair.” Oh. I said, “What else? But the people were going crazy. They loved it.” “Well, yeah, they might, but you looked really bad. You couldn’t find the stairs off the stage.” I said, “I was imitating that guy.” But this is the fake news media, just like these two fakers that were up this weekend. I think they really hurt their career. I really believe that. I think they hurt. I hope they did.
(01:00:49)
Finally, I will save America’s suburbs by protecting single-family zoning. The radical left wants to abolish the suburbs by forcing apartment complexes and low-income housing into the suburbs right next to your beautiful house. You have a beautiful house and they want a nice low-income building to be right next to you. I will end this Marxist crusade. I did it, you know. I did it five, six years ago. I did it. And the suburbs were safe. That’s why when they say suburban women maybe don’t like Trump, I think they’re wrong. I think they love me. I do. I never had problems with women. I never had any problems. But they say suburban women. So they live in the suburbs and I’m the one that says you can’t build a low-income apartment house where people want to do harm when they move in right next to your beautiful little house. And then I hear the women don’t like me. The women want strong borders. They don’t want to be hurt, molested, killed. They want their family to be safe. They want a strong military, so we’re not going to be attacked by anybody. Peace through strength.
(01:01:58)
So why wouldn’t they like me? Those are the things that I stand for. They want good education. And I’m for choice. They also want choice. Choice is a big thing in education. To get even more relief to American workers, I will massively cut taxes for working families, and we will have no taxes on tips, no taxes on social security benefits. No taxes on tips. Remember a few months ago I announced there will be no taxes on tips? A couple of weeks later, she goes, “I’d like to announce that there will be no taxes.” Well, why didn’t they do this before? In the meantime, they are putting in legislation to make it impossible for these people to avoid paying taxes on the tips. So I don’t know what they’re going to do, but I think it was a little bit of a copycat. A little bit of a copycat. And also very importantly, no taxes on social security benefits for our seniors. That’s a big deal. I don’t know, maybe that’s even a bigger deal, but I have a big one coming up.
(01:03:16)
So you have the privilege of being the first to hear this, because I’m also announcing… And you remember that, seniors, when you go to vote, you go to vote because you know what? You’ve been eaten alive by the stupid inflation caused by energy and caused by their overspending foolishly. Their stupid spending. The Inflation Reduction Act they call it. And then they said, well, it was a lie. It was really part of the Green New Scam. Okay? Remember that? They said it was a lie. It was a massive spending, trillions of dollars and it caused inflation, but it also was helped, inflation, by their stupid energy policy.
(01:03:56)
And just so you know, they’re doing about what I was doing, but that was four years ago, five years ago. I would have had it quadrupled by now. They’re doing the same thing as I was doing many years ago, but they had to. They were cutting it like crazy. They lost ANWR, the biggest site in the world, that I got. Ronald Reagan couldn’t get. Nobody in Alaska. And they went out and it was terrible. Remember the first part where it was $5, six? It was going through the roof. And he said, “Bring back the Trump plan. What did they do?” So they got those rigs going again, and we had similar numbers, but mine would have been four times, maybe five times higher by now. And what they have is they just steaming along. And let me tell you, if they won the election right after the election, they’re ending all fossil fuel. You’re not going to have any. And you’re going to find out what bad living is.
(01:04:47)
Today, I’m also announcing that as part of our additional tax cuts, we will end all taxes on overtime. You know what that means? Think of that. Think of that. Think of that. That gives people more of an incentive to work. It gives the companies a lot… It’s a lot easier to get the people. And I went to some economists, great ones, and I said, “What do you think?” They said, “It would be unbelievable. You’ll get a whole new workforce by doing the no taxes on overtime.” The people who work overtime are among the hardest-working citizens in our country. And for too long, no one in Washington has been looking out for them. Those are the people, they really work. They’re police officers, nurses, factory workers, construction workers, truck drivers and machine operators. It’s time for the working man and woman to finally catch a break. And that’s what we’re doing, because this is a good one, and I think it’s going to be great for the country.
(01:06:07)
So that’s why we will be saying that if you’re an overtime worker when you’re past 40 hours a week, think of that, your overtime hours will be tax-free. Okay? Good? You’re going to have it too. And unlike Biden where he tells you that you don’t have to pay your school tuition and it gets rejected, then he goes again and again. Now it’s totally gone. Or as they say in politics, it’s debunked, it’s gone. That was terrible. He kept saying to these students, “No more loans. No more loans.” Which was very unfair to the millions of people that actually paid off their loans over the years. Some of them took 20 years to pay them off, but that’s a dead deal. That’s totally dead. They tried to revive it two weeks ago, that didn’t work out too well. That’s a totally dead deal. But these will be three things that will get done. So if you think about no tax on tips, think of that.
(01:06:59)
Think about this and the social security for our seniors, because the seniors have been destroyed by inflation. It’s unfair. And this is like a whole new life for them, because you’re talking about a lot of money. So no tax on social securities for our great seniors. And this last one is you work your ass off, no tax on overtime, and that’s so good for the employers. One of our economists said, I think that’s actually going to bring money into our economy. When I cut taxes, we had the largest tax cut in history. And when I cut taxes with a much lower rate the following year, we took in more money than we ever took in with a much higher rate. The jobs people worked. By a lot. But this is how we will end the era of inflation, mayhem and misery under the Kamala and Crooked Joe regime; and unleash safety, prosperity, and peace for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed.
(01:08:03)
Together we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates and low inflation so that everyone can afford groceries, a car and a beautiful home. We will stop the invasion and end migrant crime, support our police, strengthen our military, build a missile defense shield over our country. Much of it will be made right here. Ronald Reagan wanted to do it many years ago, but we didn’t. Honestly, we are lucky we didn’t because we didn’t have the technology. Now we do. You see in Israel how it works, and we’re going to have the biggest and the best. We make it. We’d all make it. And a lot of it’s going to be made in a place called Arizona. Is that okay?
(01:08:52)
We will keep critical race theory and transgender insanity out of our school.
(01:08:57)
It’s amazing. It’s insane. You know that always gets the biggest applause? It’s like a poll. You’re like a pollster. You’re like a free poll, I must say. No, but you are. It always gets the biggest, because can you imagine your child goes to school and they don’t even call you and they change the sex of your child?

Speaker X (01:09:36):

No.
(01:09:36)
Boo!
(01:09:36)
No.

Donald Trump (01:09:36):

Think of it. And you know who the leader of that whole thing was? Kamala. Kamala.

Speaker X (01:09:43):

Boo!

Donald Trump (01:09:45):

And another one that gets a big hand. And it’s crazy. We will keep men out of women sports. How simple? How simple? How simple is that?
(01:10:01)
Did you see the Olympics recently? It was pretty good. But they had the prize fighters. The fighters. And they had the women’s fighter. They now have women’s boxing. That’s a big step, but they have women’s boxing. And yet there’s this beautiful young woman from Italy and she was fighting against a man who transitioned. And there were two of them that transitioned.

Speaker X (01:10:30):

Boo!

Donald Trump (01:10:30):

There were two of them that transitioned. By the way, shockingly both happened to win a gold medal. Okay?

Speaker X (01:10:35):

Boo!

Donald Trump (01:10:37):

The two transitioned men won. But the woman from Italy, she’s up, and she’s a good fighter. And she’s up and she wants to win and she’s going to show that we can take this man or the woman, this transitioned person, they say. I said, “What do I say?” They said, “Transitioned person.” And I said, “Fine, I’m going to say that.” But she’s going to show them. And he goes… For those that don’t know much about that, a left is just sort of a little defensive. Boom. She didn’t know what happened. She pulls away, they thought, what happened? She’s not. Then she gives it another try and he goes, boom, with the left, not the right. This is the one that really hurts, right? Boom. And she goes, “I’ve never been…” Then she quit. She walked off. That was the end. She didn’t even go down. She just walked off. She said, “I could never stay. I’ve never been hit like that.”
(01:11:32)
Then the other fighter, the same thing. So you had two transitioned people fighting. They both easily won gold medals. The greatest is the weightlifting though. A record that stands for 18 years. And they put an eighth of an ounce here and an eighth of an ounce here on the big barbell. And they got women that are so strong and this one was going to break the record. And she went up with that thing and her parents are right there and they’re going, “Come on, darling.” My wife hates when I do this. She says, it’s so unprecedented. She’s got a great style. No, she goes, “Do you have to do that thing with the weightlifting? It’s so…” But people like it, right? Should I do it or not?

Speaker X (01:12:22):

Yes.

Donald Trump (01:12:25):

I tell her that. I tell her that. I said, “People love it.” But she gets it up here. The parents are right where you’re sitting. These beautiful women up here. The parents, mom, dad, they’re so proud. She goes, “Come on, baby, you can do it.” You saw it. Well, can’t do it. She couldn’t get it up. Then a guy comes up, they asked him, out stage, “Have you lifted before?” “Not much, no. Just sort of started.” And he said, “Oh, good luck, sir.” I mean ma’am. And he goes up, looks down.
(01:13:13)
Give him a gold. How crazy is it? Or the swimmers. How about the swimmers? You have the greatest swimmers in the world. They want to win. They want to compete. And this one young lady, all-American swimmer, they’re all sort of all-Americans who are close. And she looks left and she sees young ladies that she’s been growing up with, because they meet the top of the peak, the top of the peak, the best. She looks left and she sees five young ladies that she’s grown up with in California and other places. She looks to the right, she sees four and this person next to her, who’s gigantic, looks like Wilt Chamberlain on steroids.
(01:13:55)
And she looks up, she’s never seen anything like this, but she’s okay because she’s like top and she’s going to break that record. She’s going to break the Olympic record. This guy had a reach that nobody has ever seen before. So he gets in and he jumps in, they jump in, they jump in that pool and she’s swimming like crazy. And as you know, you probably heard they had to take her out. She was seriously injured. You know what injured her? Wind burn. He went by her so fast that she suffered massive wind burn. Very serious problem. He won by a lot. In fact, he was having lunch while the other young ladies were coming. He was enjoying a nice lunch as the rest of them were swimming in. How demeaning to women, right? Demeaning. How ridiculous.
(01:14:50)
How demeaning to women. They have wrestling. Stand up again. Will you stand up? Right there, you with the Trump. How the hell can a woman… ? Is there any woman in this audience that wants to take this guy on?
(01:15:06)
All right. No, I love that guy. Anybody who wears a Trump shirt, I like that guy. He looks okay to me. We will defend the Second Amendment, restore free speech, and we will secure our elections. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with joy and opportunity and hope. But for that to happen, we must defeat comrade Kamala Harris. I use that term because you know what that term means, right? Communist. She’s a Marxist communist, fascist, socialist. She’s not actually a socialist. She’s gone past that. Remember I used to say America will never be a socialist country? Actually, they skipped past socialism. They started at communism. We must stop her country destroying liberal agenda once and for all. So get everyone you know, you got to go vote. You got to get people to vote, because we want to get a landslide that’s too big to rig. If we have the big votes, they can’t rig it. They try. They’re the most dishonest people. We want to go too big to rig.
(01:16:28)
On November 5th, we will save our economy. We will rescue our middle class. We will reclaim our sovereignty and restore our borders. And we will always put America first. We will take back our country. Arizona, thank you very much and God bless you all. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Thank you very much, everybody. This is an honor. What a crowd this is. Look where that crowd goes. This is a big crowd. A very special hello to Wisconsin. We really appreciate it. We’ve had great success here. We’ve had tremendous success, and I’m thrilled to be back in this incredible state with the thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots, which is what you are. If you can believe it, 59 days from now, we are going to win Wisconsin. We are going to defeat Comrade Kamala Harris, and we are going to win the White House, that gorgeous, beautiful White House. We’re going to win it, and we’re going to turn this country around because this country is a failing nation right now. It’s a laughingstock all over the world.
(00:53)
Over the past four years, our country has seen the sickness and corruption of the Washington swamp exposed like never before. You’ve seen it. You’ve been watching it. You watch those millions and millions of people pour into our country. We have no idea from where, who they are. We know nothing about them, and I’ll tell you, many of them are bad. Many of them are among the worst in the world.
(01:18)
Under the Harris-Biden regime, your government imported murderers, child predators, and serial rapists from all over the planet while weaponizing law enforcement to jail political opponents here at home. They do that, and they think it’s wonderful. It’s like a third world country, only they loot the economy. They give trillions and trillions of dollars to their left-wing cronies while you pay the cost of rampant inflation, which is what’s happened, rampant inflation, bad energy policy, and just pouring out money like it was water.
(01:54)
They run your country for their own power and profit while erasing your borders, assaulting your freedom, indoctrinating your children, and selling your jobs to China, Mexico, and all of these other foreign lands. But with your vote this election, their lying, cheating, thieving, hoaxing, and plotting will come to an end. It’s going to come to an end.
(02:19)
We’re going to cast out the corrupt political class. We’re going to restore our republic. We are going to drain the swamp, and we’re going to do it once and for all. We’re going to get it done.

Crowd (02:30):

Drain the swamp. Drain the swamp. Drain the swamp. Drain the swamp. Drain the swamp. Drain the swamp. Drain the swamp. Drain the swamp.

Donald Trump (02:42):

Thank you very much. Here are nine steps I’ll take very quickly to break the grip of this rogue regime. This is the worst president and vice president in the history of our country. There’s never been anybody that’s done the damage of these people. I used to say, and I haven’t said it in a while, if you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the country, and let’s include vice president because she’s worse than he is because she’s actually a believer. He wasn’t. But if you took the 10 worst, they haven’t done the damage that this one administration has done to our country.
(03:21)
First, I will end forever the weaponization of government and the abuse of law enforcement against political opponents. Under Comrade Kamala, Christians and pro-life activists are rotting in prison for the crime of praying in public. How about the people they’re arresting because they were praying in public? These people are sick. People like Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, good people, were locked up for following the advice of their lawyers.
(03:52)
As everyone knows, the Harris-Biden DOJ is trying to throw me in jail. They want me in jail for the crime of exposing their corruption. We expose their corruption. They go after the people that expose, not the people that do the corruption. The big news this week was that the Manhattan DA witch hunt against me has been postponed because everyone realizes that there’s no case because I did nothing wrong, did nothing wrong. Political witch hunt.
(04:25)
It’s a political attack against me by Comrade Kamala Harris and Sleepy Joe and other radical left opponents for the purpose of election interference. This is all it is. My whole life I never had anything. Now, all of a sudden, I got so many cases. Who’s indicting me today? Does anybody have any? “Well, sir, you challenged the election. We think you should be under indictment.” We challenged the corrupt election. We were right about that.
(04:54)
It’s a case that should never have been brought, and they postponed it. Nothing like this has ever happened in the United States before. It’s strictly third-world, banana-republic stuff. That’s what it is. But importantly, the public understands this. That’s why we have such a crowd today. This is a big crowd. They were trying to say that she gets big crowds. Number one, she doesn’t. Number two, she buses the people in. You see the buses. There’s nobody bused in. I’m sorry to tell you. We bused in nobody.
(05:30)
We have some people from North Carolina. I think it’s number … What is it? Those beautiful ladies from North Carolina are here again without their husbands, never have their husbands. Those poor husbands. What is this? 249 or something? 249 and we love them. We’re doing well in North Carolina. We left yesterday. We just got the endorsement of the biggest police group in the country and 380, 000 police. I said, “How many police does our country have?” But it’s 380,000 endorsed me yesterday in North Carolina, your home state, and I just want to thank them.
(06:13)
This is like number 250, and I never see their husbands. They’re all happily married, but I never see their husbands. So I don’t know what the hell is going on. They’re beautiful, and they’re always perfectly coiffed. That means they have money. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. It’s great. we always have front-row Joes over here. Look at these people.Whoa. It’s a lot of front-row Joes. They’ve been here for four days. Thank you very much. Thank you.
(06:41)
The spirit we have is greater than ever before. We did great in 2016. We did better in 2020, but you’re not allowed to say that because if you say that, they go after you. We did better by millions and millions of votes, but neither one of them compared to what’s happening now. We’ve never seen the enthusiasm and the love that we have now. This has really been incredible. If I didn’t think we did well last time, I wouldn’t have done this because it’s a little tough life. It’s not the easiest.
(07:14)
You get shot at. Other things happen. Other routine events happen. But we’re going to do it for one reason. I wouldn’t have changed it. They asked me just a little while ago. A reporter said, “Sir, if you had to do it again, would you do it again?” I said, “Absolutely, because we’re going to make America great again, and that’s better than my life.” These guys know. We know. They know. Thank you. Thank you very much.

USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA-

Donald Trump (07:59):

What an incredible crowd. Nobody’s ever had crowds like this, nobody ever. The fake news knows it. That’s a lot of fake news back there. That’s a lot of fake news. The public understands this, and so does every legal scholar, expert, luminary, including people like Andy McCarthy, Jonathan Turley, Alan Dershowitz, Mark Levin, Steven Calabrese, David Rifkin, Greg Jarrett, Katie and Andrew Cherkasky. Elie Honig of CNN even knows it.
(08:39)
They’ve said very powerfully that this is a case that should have never been brought. It’s an embarrassment. Every legal scholar of note has said this stuff shouldn’t be happening. It’s a weaponization of government. I greatly appreciate the words, if necessary. They also said the decision will be postponed, if necessary. First of all, there is no if necessary. We did nothing wrong. We’re never going to let them do this. Somebody else wouldn’t have taken it.
(09:07)
I was thinking, “How many people?” I was with some people on the plane, and they said, “How many people would have taken this? Most of them would have left. They would have said, ‘I’m getting out of this business.'” But not me. I don’t know. I don’t know. Not me. We’re up against very bad, evil people. It’s an evil force. We have people on the outside, and we have people on the inside. You have people, countries, China, Russia, Kim Jong Un.
(09:35)
We have lots of people. They’re tough, and they’re smart, and by the way, a lot smarter than what we have now. We have a bunch of dumb people. We have the dumbest leaders in the history of our country and the history of the world. But you know what? They look at us, and they say, “What the hell is going on?” Did you see? Three days ago, it started again. The Justice Department said, “Russia may be involved in our elections again.”
(10:01)
You see that, Mr. Congressman? Great congressman from Texas, you see that? Russia. It’s Russia. The whole world laughed at them this time. Two and a half years, not a phone call made to Russia, not anything to do with Russia except stopping their pipeline and lots of other things that these people approved. They said just the other day, the attorney general, “We are looking at Russia.” And I said, “Oh, no. It’s Russia, Russia, Russia all over again.”
(10:31)
But they don’t look at China, and they don’t look at Iran. They look at Russia. I don’t know what it is with poor Russia, this very … But you know what? Russia would have never happened if I were president. Attacking Ukraine would have never happened. I knew Putin. I knew him well, and he endorsed … I don’t know if you saw the other day. He endorsed Kamala. He endorsed Kamala. I was very offended by that. I wonder why he endorsed Kamala. No, he’s a chess player. He endorsed Kamala.
(11:09)
Should I be, Congressman? Should I be upset about that? No? Huh? Was it done with a smile, Ron? Was it done with a smile? I think it was done maybe with a smile. I don’t know. Who the hell knows? Nobody’s going to figure it out. They’re about 19 steps ahead of us. But this whole Russia thing, nobody was tougher on Russia in history than Trump. The person that knows that better than anyone is President Vladimir Putin. He knows it better than anyone.
(11:38)
I’ll tell you what. I will have that war finished and done and settled before I get to the White House as president-elect. I will get that done. We’ll get it done. It’s a horrible, horrible war. The deaths are far greater than you hear. You don’t hear what’s happening over there. They’re being decimated. You don’t hear what’s really happening over there. We’re going to get it done very quickly. I know both of them. I know Zelenskyy, and I know Putin. I’m going to get it done very quickly.
(12:09)
Do you ever notice? I don’t even think we try. We just give billions and billions of dollars. Does anyone ever talk to Russia about get this thing finished? Nobody talks. We don’t have any communication, nothing. We’re run by stupid people. Stupid, stupid people. We found that out at the debate with Joe. How did that work out? And we’re going to find it out again on Tuesday night. Is anybody going to be watching?
(12:44)
She’s a threat to democracy. They always say, “Donald Trump is a threat to democracy.” I’m not a threat. I’m the opposite. I’m keeping democracy. What they are, she’s a defunder of police. When somebody on the far left is in charge of defund the police for 12 years and then they switched three weeks ago or something, “Oh, we love our police.” They don’t love the police. They’re radical left Marxists, and that’s what she is.
(13:15)
It’s not even believable. It’s not believable. Defund the police. No fracking. No, we’re not going to frack. You go back a couple of years. We will never frack. There will be no fracking in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania will never frack. Now you say, “Oh, yes, we will frack.” The whole thing is a con job. She got in. She was last. They had 22 people or something running. How Biden won, I will never know. To me, it’s one of the greatest miracles. To me, it’s a great miracle.
(13:49)
But how the hell that guy won? But he won. In this one, he got 14 million votes. She got no votes, and then they put her in anyway. The bosses put her in because she’s controlled by them. But she will be the worst president. He is the worst president in history. She will be worse than him. She will be worse than him. Trump is never wrong. I am never, ever wrong.
(14:17)
But just to finish off on the weaponization, probably most of the people have heard. Just yesterday, the top spokesman, one of the top people in the US attorney’s office in Manhattan, that’s the very respected Southern District, very, very highly respected, was heard saying and was quoted exactly, quote, “Honestly, I think this case is nonsense.” Now, this is the boss of the whole thing. Every real estate person in New York does what Trump did. Nobody’s ever been charged with this before. It’s a perversion of justice.
(14:52)
He said that the DA’s office was, quote, “Stacking charges against Trump and rearranging things just to make them fit the case.” I think it is. This is the boss. I don’t know why they don’t do something. They ought to drop it. They shouldn’t delay it. They should drop it. Drop all of it. Drop all of it. I’ve been indicted more than Alphonse Capone. I say it all the time. He’s sort of the ultimate. He’s the ultimate criminal. I got indicted more than him.
(15:22)
My parents are up there. They’re great people. They’re looking down on me right now. “I can’t believe this has happened to my son. He’s been indicted more than Al Capone.” He would take that tough man sitting right in the front row. Stand up. Look at him. He’s tough as hell. He would take him out to dinner if he didn’t like him. You were gone. You would never be found again. You’d be in the foundation of a building. You would form the foundation of a building someplace in Wisconsin.
(15:46)
No, Alphonse Capone led a very vicious, violent life. But according to the statistics, I am a much worse person than Alphonse Capone. I don’t think so. But he also said, this gentleman said the New York justice system is, quote, “like the Wild West. They’re like idiots. They don’t care. They’re all political.” And he said that the persecution in Georgia by Fani Willis … You know about Fani Willis. Fani. It’s pronounced Fani, F-A-N-I. That’s fanny. But she likes it Fani.
(16:22)
When she became the whatever she became, DA, she became the DA, she said, “My name is Fani.” Fani Willis and her boyfriend, right? Wade. Lover boy Wade, remember? Remember lover boy? We hired him. We gave him almost a million dollars because of his tremendous talent at this particular section of the law. He never even heard of it. He was never involved in it. She gave him a million dollars, and she’s got no problem. I don’t know. Maybe she does have problems.
(16:53)
But it’s a persecution of very good people. Forget me. I don’t care about me. I care about 20-something people. She wanted to take down senators because a couple of senators called and said, “What the hell is going on over there? What’s happening in Georgia?” They wanted to indict senators to find out what the hell is going on. Great innocent people, great patriots have been indicted by Fani and her boyfriend, and it’s a disgrace.
(17:21)
You had people that are in their 80s. “Would you sign here?” Thomas Jefferson did the same kind of things. Alexander Hamilton, lots of people all throughout the ages. Hillary Clinton wouldn’t acknowledge the election. All of these senators like Shifty Schiff, can you imagine Shifty Adam Schiff? All of them, they disputed the 2016 election. It’s okay for them to do it, but if we do it’s a serious, serious crime.
(17:53)
These people are sick. We got to get them the hell out of there. We have to win this election. Have to win this election, right? He knows. That guy knows. That guy knows. He said, just in ending this, that the … It’s just so good. I have to say the whole thing because it’s so good. I mean this is one of the top people in justice in the country and the boss, and he said, “The persecution in Georgia by Fani Willis is a mockery of justice. It’s a joke. The whole thing is disgusting. They’re just out to get him,” meaning Trump.
(18:28)
They’re just out to get me. I think that’s true. I don’t think that’s true. I know that’s true. But they couldn’t have picked a worse target because it’s made me more popular. Can you believe that? I think I’m the only person in the history of government that got indicted and my poll numbers went up. You know why? Because you know that it’s fake. It’s corrupt just like Russia, Russia, Russia was corrupt, just like their job numbers last week were corrupt.
(18:56)
Did you see? They added 818,000 fake jobs on to try and make their numbers look better, and they got caught by a whistleblower. Thank you, whistleblower. Thank you very much. That’s incredible, right? That’s incredible. 818, Jeff, and they were going to announce it because usually you cheat for 5,000, 6,000. Them, they cheat for 5,000, 6,000, I’ve heard. Never has anybody seen 818,000, and they were going to announce a correction right after the election. But fortunately, a whistleblower came in and leaked it out, and that was a great thing and should be … If that were a Republican instead of a Democrat, they’d be out of office now for what they did. That was a fraud. 818,000 jobs. That’s a fraud. If Comrade Kamala Harris gets four more years, you will be living a full-blown banana republic ruled by an anarchy and a tyranny. You’re going to have something. It’s not her. It’s the people that surround her. They’re scum. They’re scum, and they want to take down our country.
(20:04)
They are absolute garbage. Hey, how about the J6 Committee? So the J6 Committee of political thugs and losers gets together, and they investigate J6 for years, destroyed the lives of many people, and now it was revealed fairly recently that they destroyed and deleted all documents, all evidence, all proof. They don’t have anything. You know why? Because a lot of it pointed to Nancy Pelosi. It was her fault because she’s supposed to be in charge of security and she turned down thousands of soldiers or National Guard.
(20:45)
She turned them down, and it was so obvious. All of the stories, many of those stories were fake stories. They were all made up, and we caught them because the Secret Service, frankly, said that stuff wasn’t true. They deleted and destroyed documents. Now, I think that’s a criminal act. Isn’t it a criminal act? What the hell happened? When is something going to happen? How come it always happens to a Republican but doesn’t happen to them?
(21:08)
They deleted and destroyed every ounce of documents and evidence that they did over a year and a half because it came out badly for them, and they should pay a big price for that. They should pay a big price. The moment we win, we will rapidly review the cases of every political prisoner unjustly victimized by the Harris regime, and I will sign their pardons on day one. I will sign it on day one, day one.
(21:43)
We will completely overhaul Kamala’s corrupt Department of Injustice and turn the Injustice department back into the best law enforcement agency on the planet. Instead of persecuting Republicans, they will focus on taking down bloodthirsty cartels, transnational gangs, and radical Islamic terrorists, which words they won’t even say. They won’t even say any of those words. Second, I will bring back free speech in America because it’s been taken away.
(22:17)
They’ve taken away your free speech, and the fake news threat is a threat to this country. They are just horrible. These are horrible people, not everyone. I mean I know most of them up there. Some are good. Hello, Brian. Some are good, and most of them are just absolutely terrible human beings. They know what’s going on. You know what they’ll write today? But look at this crowd. It goes from corner to corner. I flew over, and I said, “That’s a lot of people down there.”
(22:43)
You know what they’ll say today or tomorrow when they write? “Donald Trump spoke today in Wisconsin before a small crowd of people, a small gathering, a small gathering of people.” They are just so bad. I don’t know. It’s really hard to turn it back around unless … They used to be like the police force. They’d write the truth, but they’re no longer the police force. They’re the police force for opposite. They’re a police force for bad. They’re bad. They’re bad people, and they’re very dishonest.
(23:12)
A lot of people don’t understand. When you’re a politician like these people, like me, like others, and you happen to be a Republican or somewhat conservative, they write just the opposite of what the facts are. If you’re driving a cab, if you’re an accountant, if you’re a lawyer, if you’re something other than that, you don’t know the details. When we know the facts, then the story gets written the exact opposite of what it is. You start to lose faith in the press, I will tell you.
(23:40)
But I will sign an executive order banning any federal employee from colluding to limit speech, and we will fire every federal bureaucrat who is engaged in domestic censorship under the Harris regime. We will do that. Third is I will expel warmongers. We have these people, they want to go to war all the time. You know why? Missiles are $2 million apiece. That’s why. They love to drop missiles all over the place. I had no wars.
(24:09)
You remember Crooked Hillary used to say, “Look at him. Look at him. He’s going to cause wars.” No, no. My personality stopped wars. She said, “Look at his personality. He’s going to cause wars.” My personality stopped wars. We had no wars, other than I finished wars that they couldn’t finish. I defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate, et cetera, and did it quickly. We did it in four weeks. They said it was going to take five years. We did it in four weeks.
(24:38)
We have the greatest military. I got to tell you, they’re not woke. Don’t worry about it when you hear they’re woke. Guys like Milley and some of these guys that were on the top, he’s gone now, which is a great thing. He’s the one that said, “Leave all the equipment in Afghanistan. It’s cheaper.” He told me that, too. That’s when I didn’t listen to him anymore. He said, “It’s cheaper to leave an airplane that costs $150 million brand-new than it is to fly it out

Donald Trump (25:00):

… out with a tank of fuel, jet fuel. It’s cheaper to leave it behind. I said, “This guy is really bad. He is really bad.” You know it’s amazing though, not one person from that horrible tragedy of Afghanistan, not one general, not one leader in any way got fired, not one person. Biden never fired anybody because they have the goods on him. So I fired people like crazy. I love to fire people. I love to fire people that didn’t do their job. I fired a lot of people that didn’t do … I fired him. You didn’t do your job. I’m sorry. Say hello to your family. You’re fired. Get out. We got to get some …
(25:38)
I will expel the warmonger from our national security state and carry out a much needed clean up of the military industrial complex to stop the war profiteering and to put always America first. We put America first. We’re going end these endless wars. Endless wars, they never stop. You ever seen these wars? They go on for 14 years, 20 years. They’re fighting ISIS for 21 years. These people are something. We knocked them out in two months. One month, actually. We had a good general there. General Raising Cain. General Raising Cain. We have great generals. We have great leaders. We have great military and they are not going woke. You could put them in a room for two years and scream woke crap to them and they’d walk out and they wouldn’t be changed. They’re not going woke. Don’t worry about our military.
(26:35)
Fourth, to curtail the power of federal bureaucrats and save your thousands of dollars, we will cut 10 old regulations for every one new regulation. And at the suggestion of a great guy, Elon Musk, has anyone ever heard of him? Huh? No? Elon. Oh, there’s a rocket. Oh, look, a rocket is flying. It’s Elon. He’s very good at what he does. He’s going to have to save them. They have two people up there. Boeing had a little … I shouldn’t say, there’s a beautiful Boeing plane there, but Boeing had a little hard time as you heard. So they’re going to save … Elon is going to send up a rocket. He looks forward to it. That’s all he thinks about is things like that. I said, “Elon, what’s taking so long? Let’s get going.” But you watch, he’ll get that problem solved. What a terrible problem. It’s embarrassing.
(27:26)
That’s what’s happening with our country. Everything is embarrassing. We don’t win anymore. We don’t win anymore. We used to win all the time. We won with me. We won everything with me. We won everything. Remember I came to office and they told me … They greeted me with the following statement, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” I said, “Wait a minute. We have no ammunition?” “No, sir. We’ve given it all away to our allies.” Allies, by the way, they are allies, but not when we need them. They’re only allies when they need something. If we were ever attacked, none of these countries or very few of them, that we talk about all the time, none of them would come. We were just attacked by such and such a country. Listen, we need your help. They wouldn’t take your phone call. But we give away billions and billions of dollars. Now, I was greeted with a statement that, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” And I built and rebuilt the greatest military in the world. And the first thing I did was ammunition. I got ammunition from everywhere as fast as you could. And I said to him, “Mr. Congressman, what the hell are you saying, we have no ammunition? Even if it’s true, you don’t talk about it.” Can you imagine, President Xi, thank goodness he was in a good mood. He’s listening that we have no ammunition. Do you think he likes that sound? That’s a beautiful sound to him. I said, “Why would you say it?”

Audience (28:49):

Medic. Medic.

Donald Trump (28:54):

Medic, please. Doctor. Thank you. Thank you very much. Take your time. Thank you, Doctor. We get the greatest service here. It’s amazing the way they just are right on it. Amazing. And some people are out here for three days, three days, so it’s really incredible that things like this don’t happen more often actually, but they always turn out to be good. They’re excited. They’re excited by what we’re doing because we’re taking our country back from these lunatics. Take your time, Doctor.

Audience (29:32):

We love you, Donald.

Donald Trump (29:34):

Donald Trump (29:51):

Thank you.

Audience (29:57):

Thank you, Donald Trump.
(29:57)
We appreciate you.
(29:57)
We love Donald.
(29:57)
Love you.

Donald Trump (30:06):

I don’t want to say too many thank-yous because you saw Kamala at the convention when she got up. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank, thank, thank, thank. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. I said, “What’s wrong with her?” What the … so I don’t want to say too much. Is that right, fellas? I guess every once in a while I’ll say thank you and I mean it, thank you. But my thank you is meaningful, I will tell you. Thank you very much.

Audience (30:44):

We love Trump. We love Trump. We love Trump.

Donald Trump (30:44):

Thank you very much.

Audience (30:44):

We love Trump.

Donald Trump (30:45):

Thank you very much.

Audience (30:45):

We love Trump. We love Trump. We love Trump. We love Trump. We love Trump. We love Trump.

Donald Trump (30:54):

Everything good? Everything good? Everybody happy? We have a good, strong person back there, is getting up. Yes. Okay. You tell me when. You tell me when, you in the red shirt with those big muscles in your arms as big, beautiful, beautiful person. Let me go. Should we go? You tell me when gets far back. These are the greatest people that will do this because they love the country. Is that okay?

Audience (31:29):

We love you.

Donald Trump (31:46):

Is that what the okay? Is that what the okay sign is? She’s okay?

Audience (32:12):

Everyone say a prayer.

Donald Trump (32:12):

Say a prayer. Yeah. Say a prayer. We need more prayers in this nation, I can tell you right now. That’s the other thing, they want to shut down your religion and they’ve done a pretty good job of it, to be honest with you. Thank you, Doctor. Good doctors in these crowds. We have a lot of doctors in these crowds. There’s always plenty of doctors. They’re good ones too. In Butler, two of the doctors, they saved two people’s lives that they thought were gone. We had Corey, the great firefighter, Corey, and he was gone. But the doctors saved the other two and they thought they were gone. They were amazing. Amazing doctors.

Audience (33:20):

One more set for Trump.
(33:20)
Teachers for Trump.

Donald Trump (33:45):

Take your time, Doctor. We have time, right? Right. We have time.

Audience (34:00):

Hispanics for Trump.

Donald Trump (34:02):

That’s right.

Audience (34:02):

We’re Americans.

Donald Trump (34:09):

We’re getting a good sign I think. Is that a good sign? We’re getting a lot of good signs. That’s great. Good. Got some good news back there, Ron, huh? Good job. I watched your speech today. Beautiful. Thank you.

Audience (34:30):

I love you, Trump.

Donald Trump (34:44):

Yes? Good. Thank you very much. Thank you. And just make some room for them so they can get out and hopefully come back before were finish because we can stay here all day as far as I’m concerned. We’ll stay here all day. Thank you very much. Doctors, thank you very much. We appreciate it. Anything happens let us know.
(35:09)
But at the suggestion of Elon Musk, I will create a government efficiency commission to conduct a complete financial and performance audit for the entire federal government. And we will cut the fat out of our government for the first time meaningfully in 60 years. We’re going to cut the fat. There is so much fat you won’t even know it’s gone.
(35:35)
Fifth, we will drain the government education swamp and stop the abuse of your taxpayer dollars to indoctrinate America’s youth with all sorts of things that you don’t want to have our youth hearing. Ultimately, we’ll … And you know what we’re doing here. I say it all the time. I’m dying to get back to do this. We will ultimately eliminate the Federal Department of Education and send education back to Wisconsin and back to the States. We’ll send it back to the States so that Ron Johnson can run it, okay? We’ll send it back here.
(36:17)
Mr Tiffany, we’ll get to our Congressman Tiffany involved. He made a good speech, too. We are at the bottom of every single list in education, you know that? We are at the bottom of every single list, and yet we’re number one in terms of cost per pupil. So, you know the expression I used once, twice, three times before, and it was very effective actually, what the hell do we have to lose, right? We’ll send our education back to the States and some states will do a fantastic job. Some won’t. And it’s the same ones that are laggards right now. I don’t want to name them because why would we want to embarrass Gavin Newscom and some of these people. Gavin Newscom. Why would we want to embarrass him?
(37:01)
By the way, speaking of California, she destroyed, as you know, Kamala destroyed the greatest city in America, San Francisco. She destroyed it. Totally destroyed it. Then she became attorney general of the state. She destroyed the state of California. Now, she’s running for president. We’re not going to let that happen.
(37:20)
Six, we will not tolerate so-called equity policies that punish Americans based on race or gender. America will return to the merit principle which has just been approved by the Supreme Court of the United States. You work hard and you will be very successful. We’re back to the merit system. Nobody thought that was ever even possible. We need merit. There are so many people that are left out in the cold and that’s not going to happen anymore. You work hard, you work diligently, you go to school, you do what you have to do, but it’s based on merit again. You haven’t heard that in many, many years.
(37:57)
And seventh, working with Robert F. Kennedy, Junior, you know Bobby. RFK, Jr. That was a meaningful endorsement. That was a great endorsement. We will take on the corruption at the FDA, the CDC World Health Organization, and other institutions of public health that have dominated and really are dominated by corporate power and dominated really by China. The World Health Organization, they called COVID totally wrong. And I looked into it. We were paying them $ 500 million a year. China was paying them for 1.4 billion. We don’t really know what we have because so many people have come into our country. We have no idea what we have. But let’s assume we have 350 million, including 20 or 25 million criminal migrants, in many cases, criminals. We have some of the worst people in the world coming into our country. Some of the worst criminals in the world are coming into our country. But we have 350 million people let’s say. They have 1.4 billion. They pay 39 million. We pay 500 million. Do you think that’s a good deal?

Audience (39:06):

No.

Donald Trump (39:08):

So I pulled out of it. And they came to me and they wanted me to go back in, they wanted us to go back in. And I kept saying, no, no, no, I don’t want to do it. And it became actually a very popular thing. I hate to say this, but politically, people really liked it because they knew how we were abused by them. It’s run by China, it’s not run by us. We pay 500 and it’s run by China who pays 39 million. So they wanted to come back, and I said, “Well, how come China is paying 39 million, they have 1.4 billion people? And we’re paying for a much smaller number of people. We’re paying 500. We will make the same deal as we made with China.” Well, I said, “That would mean we’d be paying about 8 million,” right? They said, “No, we will make the same, we’ll let you come in for 39 million.” And you know what, I turned them down. Not for that. I turned them down for other reasons because they weren’t good and they were dominated by China.
(40:02)
But Biden came in, this stupid person came in, and he approved $590 million. Now, he knew what was going on. He knew that … Well, he probably didn’t. He really … do you think he knew? I don’t think he knew. Do you think somebody said, “Sir, we can do it for 39?” It’s not the biggest number when you’re talking trillions all the time. But it’s indicative of stupidity. And she’s worse than him. He is a smarter person than she is.
(40:34)
Oh, they’re waiting for the debate. If I destroy her in the debate, they’ll say, “Trump suffered a humiliating defeat tonight.” No matter what. Although, with Biden, one of the CNN people said that, about my part, they said, “The Donald Trump performance tonight was the single greatest debate performance I’ve ever seen.” Two days later, all they did is talk about how bad he was. They didn’t talk about me. They didn’t talk about me anymore. But no, it’s a crooked system, but we’re going to make it a very legitimate system again. We can do that and I think we can do it pretty easily with people like you have over here. I think we can actually do it pretty easily.
(41:18)
We will establish a panel of top experts to investigate what is causing the decades-long increase in chronic health problems and childhood diseases, including the autoimmune disorders, autism, obesity, infertility, and much more. And Bobby is going to be very much involved in that. We’re going to get him involved because that’s what he likes. That’s what he’s great at. Isn’t it great to have a Kennedy with us? Isn’t that nice?
(41:47)
And this is really … I mean, I don’t want to disrespect the rest of the family, but this has been the dominant Kennedy for the last 25 years. He’s a great guy. I’ve known him a long time. He’s a great guy and he really wants what’s good for the country, and to have his endorsement is a very important thing. And Tulsi endorsed us too, almost simultaneously, and we love Tulsi. She’s been fantastic. She’s a woman of great common sense, actually. I’ve watched her for a long time. She has great common sense.
(42:15)
I will ask Congress to pass sweeping reforms to prevent foreign influence, peddling, bribery and corruption like we have seen with a certain family in the United States. The Biden crime family, that’s the family. What the hell is happening with that family, Ron? What’s going on with that family? The night he spoke at the convention, Congress found out that he stole $27 million, nothing happened. Nothing happens with these people. He stole $27 million and he was speaking at the convention. They were saying what a wonderful president he was. The worst ever in history.
(42:52)
He made a State of the Union speech, the last one, it was so bad. And I turned to CNN and MSDNC, I wanted to see how bad they’d report on it because, it had to be bad, and I turned, and one of them said, “Not since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has a speech been made so brilliantly or delivered so well.” He was coughing in his hand all the time. He’s coughing, then he walks out and shakes everybody’s hand. Some people actually didn’t want … They went, “Hello, sir. Hello, sir. It’s wonderful to have you up there, sir.” So can you imagine, though?
(43:30)
Franklin Roosevelt was a great speaker in a certain way, a very elegant person, came from a very elegant neighborhood, so to speak, very, very rich and entitled, but different from these people you have today, but very beautiful speaker. And they compared him to Franklin. Not since Franklin Roosevelt. Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Has anybody made a state of the union like that? And I said, this is really terrible. This is really terrible.
(43:56)
And finally, I will support modifying the 25th Amendment to make clear that if a vice president lies or engages in a conspiracy to cover up the incapacity of the President of the United States. If you do that with a cover up of the President of the United States, it’s grounds for impeachment immediately and removal from office, because that’s what they did. That’s what they did. Think of it, if he didn’t go to that debate, he’d still be running. He’d still be running.
(44:34)
To every citizen who is sick and tired of the parasitic political class in Washington that sucks our country of its blood and treasure, November 5th will be your Liberation Day. November 5th, this year, will be the most important day in the history of our country because we’re not going to have a country anymore if we don’t win. It will be the most important day in the history of our country. I used to say that about 2016 because the border was bad, but the border was bad. It was like 5% of what’s going on now. It was fine. And I fixed it very quickly and beautifully. And then I couldn’t talk about it. I kept saying I want to talk for the next election where we got millions more votes. I couldn’t talk about it. They said, “Sir, people don’t want to hear about the border. It’s in great shape. You fixed it.” I said, “I want to talk about the border.” They said, “Sir, I’m telling you nobody cares,” and it’s true. I used to talk about the border, they didn’t care because I fixed it.
(45:33)
But this border is so much worse. This border is at a level that there’s never been a border in the history of the world that’s been where 20 or 25 million people have poured in and nobody has any idea where they’re coming from.
(45:47)
Here in Wisconsin, you also need to defeat a radical left senator named Tammy Baldwin, who’s bad news. Baldwin voted with Biden almost 100% of the time, giving you open borders, horrific inflation, the Afghanistan disaster. That’s the most embarrassing day, I think, in the history of our country, right? He’s nodding. I agree. And everything else, all of these problems that we have, all of the open borders and the people pouring in. All of it. The energy, we can solve quickly. Everything we can solve. But we have to do something. We have millions of people coming … I mean, they’ve poured in. They’re here. They are here.
(46:34)
The border has been a little bit tougher lately because there’s an election. That’s the only reason. So the numbers are a little bit better than they were three months ago. But that’s only for purposes of … The fact is, these people, these 20 to 25 million people are already in our country. What they’ve done to us, it’s suicidal. It is suicidal. What they’ve done to this country, nothing like that has ever … It’s an invasion of our country.
(47:01)
But running against Tammy Baldwin is a true American Patriot. He really is. He’s an incredible guy. I don’t know, nothing is easy. You beat these people that are in Washington for so long and many of them are no good, but they are hard to beat. They are hard to beat. She’s no good. I mean, I was president for four years, I’m not even sure if I ever met her. She doesn’t do anything. She just votes the party line and then she gets the party support. She doesn’t do anything for Wisconsin.
(47:32)
When I gave you the big boat contract, I gave you the biggest boat contract in years, and a lot of people didn’t want it to go here. Everybody wanted it. I gave it. She never called me. She was the one person that should have been calling me. She never called me. I gave it to you for other reasons.
(47:49)
But we have somebody that’s running, number one, he’s central casting, you have to say. This guy is central casting and he’s smart and he’s tough, and he’s a hero and he’s a success, and he’ll make an incredible senator for you and your wonderful people, who I know so well in Wisconsin. Eric Hovde is great. Come on up, Eric. Come on up. Come on, Eric.

Mr. Hovde (48:19):

Thank you, Mr President. Let’s give President Trump a big Wisconsin hello. All of us are here for one reason. And it’s the reason why this man is going through all that he’s gone through. He has been put through hell, attack after attack. Why I’m going through this, why you’re showing up here, we love our country. We love America. And what the Democratic Party has become today are a bunch of progressive socialists that are destroying our wonderful country. They have turned our country upside down. What was right has become wrong, and what was wrong has become right. They’re damaging our country economically.
(49:19)
Under President Trump, your wages increased 7.7%, one of the highest growth rates ever. Under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, they’ve declined by 2.2% because of all their inflation and reckless spending.
(49:37)
Under President Trump, the border was almost closed and he would have gotten the job done. Under them, who knows how many people flooding our country with criminal elements and fentanyl killing our young people. And then they push these crazy ideas like boys playing in girls’ sports, men going

Mr. Hovde (50:00):

… going into women’s bathrooms, or transgendering our kids. That’s right. Now, what they are experts at is lying. Kamala Harris and Tammy Baldwin are Expert liars. President Trump, Tammy Baldwin runs ads acting like she worked with you and getting things done in this state. I mean, it’s priceless. Kamala Harris is now trying to steal your ideas. No tax on tips. They’re trying to act like they are pushing aback against the invasion of our southern border. We’re going to be tough on the border, right? Where have you been? They’ve pushed to defund the police. They never stood with the police. Now they’re trying to act like they’re tough on law enforcement. Everything they’ve said has been a lie, and on top of it, they’re corrupt. They are corrupt. Tammy Baldwin rails against Wall Street, and yet she lives on Wall Street with her Wall Street executive partner and taking money hand over fist.
(51:11)
So that’s what we’re up again. Now, folks, as President Trump said, we have 59 days. This is the time. We can’t go another four years what they’re going to put us through. I’m going to tell every one of you, you have to walk away from here today. You have to grab every neighbor you know who’s in the middle, every family member that you know that’s in the middle. Every friend, you got to sit down, you got to talk to them, and you got to get them to come over to our side for President Trump and me to bring this country back. So are you ready? Are you ready to fight for your country? Are you ready to save the American dream? Let’s go get them. Thank you everyone. Thank you president Trump.

Donald Trump (52:04):

[inaudible 00:52:07] Thank you, I really appreciate it.

Mr. Hovde (52:04):

Today, I wore a tie for you.

Donald Trump (52:04):

I know. Thank you very much.

Crowd (52:04):

USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.

Donald Trump (52:20):

Thank you very much, Eric. Great speech.

Speaker 1 (52:21):

Great mustache.

Donald Trump (52:29):

Eric, thank you very much. That was great. He’d be a great senator. He’ll be with another great senator, a friend of mine for a long time, Ron Johnson, who’s here and made a wonderful speech. Thank you Ron. Ron made a wonderful, wonderful speech and you have a congressman from Texas that’s here. He is very special. He’s been with me from day one. He would be with me even if I did a lousy job perhaps, but he likes the job I’ve done. He literally is camped out in Wisconsin. His name is Troy Nehls and he brought his brother. I believe they’re twins. You certainly look like twins, huh? He’s better looking than you, actually.
(53:11)
But Troy is amazing. His brother’s Trevor, and what Troy has done is incredible. He’s literally very popular in Texas. He’s a very powerful, wonderful congressman in Texas and he’s come here and he’s staying here and he’s working so hard, and I said, what are you doing? He says, we got to get you elected. If you win Wisconsin, you’re going to win the whole thing. This is a big deal. Wisconsin’s a big deal. So I remember that Troy, I know it. I’ve been hearing all about Troy’s doing meetings and speeches and everything and it’s amazing. He’s back in Texas. They love him even more for what you’re doing, because they know exactly, we’re doing very nicely in Texas to put it mildly. We’re winning by about 16 points or something, but this is a big one, so thank you very much. I appreciate you both very much.
(53:58)
Thank you. And a man who I watched his speech, he did a very, very good job. Tom, Tiffany, where’s Tom? Tom? Great job, great speech. Thank you. I watched it from the plane, Tom. Great. Thank you. Very popular guy. Very good guy. Very great congressman. Wisconsin GOP Chairman, Briar. Where is Brian? Brian Schimming. Brian, thank you very much. He’s doing a, are we winning, Brian? I think so, right? You’ve been fantastic. Thank you. Brian. Right from day one. Door County GOP Chair Stephanie Soucek. Stephanie, thank you. Thank you, Stephanie. Great job. Pierce County GOP Chair Stephanie Potton.
(54:49)
Thank you. Thank you, Stephanie. Two Stephanies. And Marathon County GOP Chair, where are you? Kevin, where are you? Kevin, thank you very much. Thank you very much Kevin. Also with us is famed country singer and she wrote some songs that have been top of the line and a winner of awards all over the place. Gretchen Wilson, where’s Gretchen? Gretchen, thank you very much. Great job. Great job. Do you want to come up Gretchen? Okay, come up. Come up. Come up. What the hell? It’s a Saturday. We have all day, right? Come on. Thank you.

Gretchen Wilson (55:40):

It’s an honor to meet you.

Donald Trump (55:40):

Thank you, it’s a great honor, thank you, Gretchen, very nice.

Gretchen Wilson (55:40):

I have notes. Is that okay?

Donald Trump (55:40):

Yes, it sure [inaudible 00:55:41]

Gretchen Wilson (55:41):

Hello again, Wisconsin. My name again is Gretchen Wilson. I’m a Midwesterner. I come from a very small town in Southern Illinois. I grew up very much like Senator JD Vance. I had to work hard and fight my way out of poverty just like many other Americans have done, but this is what I was taught to do, to earn my way. Since then, I’ve done the impossible. I am now a Grammy award-winning country music artist, a producer, a songwriter, and most importantly, a mom. Now, back in the day, my family were all Kennedy democrats, but that’s when the Democrats were on the side of the people. Once I started paying attention to what was really going on, I realized the Democratic Party left us. As a songwriter, I pay close attention to words, the words that are being used and the words that are not being used.
(56:51)
I urge all Americans to pay close attention to what you are hearing and not hearing from the media, because the issues that are most important for our survival are what we’re voting on. I’m here today to entertain you, but I’m also here today to show my support for the only team in this race that is telling you the truth. My story isn’t really that rare, but the American dream that I have been fortunate enough to find will most certainly be lost forever if we do not show up and vote for freedom in November. It is on us. Let’s make sure we the people do all we can to save our country by voting for President Trump and JD Vance. Thank you very much for your time.

Donald Trump (57:48):

Thank you, Gretchen. [inaudible 00:57:49] Beautiful words, thank you.

Gretchen Wilson (57:48):

[inaudible 00:57:49]

Donald Trump (57:54):

Thank you, Gretchen. Great. That’s great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it Gretchen. As borders are, Kamala Harris let in over 20 million, they’re now saying the number could be 25 million illegal aliens from 168 different countries. Most people don’t even know that you have that many countries, coming from prisons and jails and insane asylums and mental institutions, and terrorists at a level that we’ve never seen before. I told this a few times. We were, during the border patrol is fantastic, and ICE, and our whole thing with the police officers, they’re all, these are people that are brave and great, and they really want to do their job, but they came out with the border patrol, a study on terrorism, and they said in 2019, my year, they said, not one terrorist came into the country. Now I don’t really believe that, it can’t be that good. It can’t be, because now we have thousands coming in.
(58:49)
But the fact that they’d even say that, and they didn’t do it for me, they just did a report. They said, not one terrorist 2019, check it out. They said, not one terrorist came into the country. Now we have thousands and thousands and thousands of terrorists pouring into our country at record levels, and it’s going to end very badly. It’s going to end very badly. We got to get them the hell out of here. We got to get them out of here fast. What they’ve done in allowing maybe 25 million people into our country, it should be illegal. They’re destroying, it should be illegal, and maybe it is illegal. They’re destroying our country. They’re ruining our country. In Aurora, Colorado, entire apartment complexes are being taken over by armed Venezuela gangs with weapons the likes of which even the military doesn’t see. They’re terrorizing residents and they’re just menacing the whole state.
(59:43)
But they are menacing that community and the people are petrified, even the sheriff, he’s trying his best, but he’s got a small force by comparison, this is like a military force, and they’re vicious violent people. By the way, Venezuelan crime is down 72%. Crime is down all over the world because they’re sending their criminals, not just South America, from all over the world they’re sending their criminals. They’re sending people in jail for murder and drugs and everything else. They’re sending them into our country. They’re getting rid of them. Crime’s down all over the world. Our crime is through the roof, and you haven’t seen the migrant crime yet. It’s started and it’s vicious, but you haven’t seen the extent of it yet. They’re just getting settled in. Colorado is a total mess with a governor that has no idea what to do. He has no idea. He’s confused. He’s afraid of the migrants, but he doesn’t want to say it because that’s a bad thing to say. If you’re a Democrat, they put you right out of business.
(01:00:44)
He fears the policies of Kamala, but doesn’t want to lose his base or his job. He’s afraid to say anything about it. Colorado began the threat to democracy against me where they tried to unconstitutionally remove me from the ballot. I was the leading person in the whole country, leading everybody by a lot, and they said, let’s remove him from the ballot. And then they say, I’m a threat to democracy. Think about that. But Colorado was the one that did it at the behest of the governor, probably. Many people in Colorado were absolutely angry at it. They didn’t like it. Even Democrats and liberals, they said, that’s terrible. You can’t do that. Democrats did it. The concept of taking the number one person in the Republican Party by far, and taking them off the ballot so that the Republicans don’t even have a nominee, because this was very far down the line.
(01:01:39)
The case for me was won at the United States Supreme Court quickly and unanimously, and the governor, Jared Polis had no idea what to do or say, never apologized, never did anything. They’re radicals headed up by a radical governor in Colorado that has no clue how to solve this influx of crime into a state. And by the way, Colorado’s one state, it’s much worse in other states. But in Colorado they’ve taken over. I mean in Colorado, they’re so brazen. They’re taken over sections of the state, and getting them out will be a bloody story. Should have never been allowed to come into our country. Nobody checked them. Nobody checked were they criminals? Were they from jails? We have them pouring out from jails. We have the worst criminals in, all of these countries, 168 so far are registered, 168 countries. They’re in our country. And they said, if you come back, you’ll be executed.
(01:02:39)
You’ll be killed immediately. Not going to be easy, but we’ll do it. But they have no clue how to solve their influx of crime in Colorado or anywhere else. But far more importantly, heading this governor’s way are numbers of bad people that nobody will ever believe. That’s just a little small group of people that are taking over. These people are tough. I always say, they make our criminals look like nice people. At the time it happened, people said, I would win Colorado. Colorado’s traditionally not a Republican state, but I was actually tied and leading in polls in Colorado because people were so incensed at what this governor and his cronies had done by trying to strip the Republican Party of their candidate. So if I don’t win Colorado, it will be taken over by migrants and the governor will be sent fleeing, because the people of Colorado should really do something, that would be a classic.
(01:03:37)
They should do a major protest vote in favor of Trump to reject the threat to democracy that they caused by an attempt at ballot removal. And Illinois is really the same thing. And Maine, another one. I mean I don’t understand. I did very well in Maine, but they did that. The governors did that. Illinois is one of the worst-run states in the country, headed by a governor, J.B Pritzker, whose family threw him out of the family business, so he became governor instead, and his state is going to hell. It’s horrible what’s happening. So if you live in Chicago and your state is going to hell, vote for Donald Trump, just vote. We’ll do a good job. We’ll clean it up. We’ll get rid of that horrible crime. Do you know in Labor Day weekend, Chicago had 117 people shot, 17 died? This is worse than Afghanistan.
(01:04:36)
This is worse than any place. It’s a war zone. Other states should also vote for Trump in protest because their way of life has been changed in America. Protest it. Go back to the Democrats in four years, but you won’t because we’ll clean up this mess and you’ll say, we’re never voting for a Democrat. We like Trump and his friends, migrants in crime are here in our country at levels never thought possible before, never even thought possible. You’re not safe even sitting here, to be honest with you. I’m the only one that’s going to get it done. Everybody’s saying that. I’m starting to believe it myself, but they’re saying the only one that’s going to get it done, and I will tell you, I’m going to get it done. And so go out and do that protest. If you’re Maine, if you’re in Illinois, if you’re in any state, because you’re being overrun by criminals, you’re being overrun by people.
(01:05:29)
They’re not being checked. They’re not being vetted. They’re taking over our country. They’re forming armies in our country. And Aurora is just one example of many locations. Other places are probably even in worse shape, we just haven’t heard about them yet. And a lot of governors don’t like talking about it, like this guy Polis. He said, no, no, don’t talk about it. We don’t want the world to find out. The world has found out. The world has found out. They have all the pictures. They have all the tape that you want. I’ve never seen anything like it. They walk in, they throw people out of their apartments, they take over the whole building. Now they take over another building. They’re in the real estate business. Isn’t that nice? They were in jail two months ago. Now they’re in the real estate business in Colorado just two days ago, right here in small town Wisconsin.
(01:06:16)
What a beautiful place. However, a member of a savage Venezuela gang was arrested for sexually assaulting a woman and attacking viciously a child. He’s charged with suffocation, child abuse, sexual assault, and many other things. Bad guy, shouldn’t be in the country, came out of jail, came out of jail in his country. I will get these monster criminals out of Wisconsin. I will get them out of our country. We’re going to get them out fast. We’re going to get them out fast, very fast. They’ll soon be back on the streets and jails of Caracas, Venezuela and other places from where they came. Think of it though. Venezuela crime is down 72%. People are saying, oh, isn’t it wonderful, Venezuela? In fact, if they win, we’re never going to lose touch with each other if they win, but we won’t come here. It’ll be too dangerous. We will have a meeting.
(01:07:15)
We will have a rally in Caracas, Venezuela, because it will be safe by comparison to Wisconsin. So we’ll all hop in a flight. We’ll go over to Caracas, Venezuela or one of hundreds of other countries that are safer than the US because our country is a very unsafe country now, and we’re really subject to what these people want to do. And these are violent people. These are people that were criminals at the worst level in their cities all over the world. 22 people out of the Congo in Africa. It’s not just South America. People think it’s Honduras and Guatemala, El Salvador, Mexico.
(01:07:55)
It’s not, it’s countries all over the world. They’re coming in. 22 people from the Congo in Africa. Where are you from? From the Congo. Oh, that’s nice. Where do you live? Jail. Oh, what did you do? It’s none of your business. That’s what they told the people. It’s none of your business. You can imagine what it is. But from Africa, from the Middle East, from Europe, from Asia, they’re coming in from everywhere. They’re getting rid of their criminals. They’re bringing them into the United States of America, our beautiful country, our now failing country. It’s a failing country under these lunatics. And they’re bringing them in at levels that nobody’s ever seen before. Ron Johnson sees it. He sees it all the time and he gets sick over it. But we’re going to do something about it, Ron. We’re going to get it done. We have no choice.
(01:08:46)
It’s not like we have a choice, not like we can say, oh, well, we’ll live with it. You can’t live with it because you’re going to be killed. These are killers, but from all over the world. You take a look at the crime statistics, you take a look at the jail statistics, the jails are being emptied out, the mental institutions are being emptied out, and insane asylums. And then the press, when I say Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the press says, oh, why did he mention that? They’re wise guys back, there just wise guys. They say he rambled and started talking about Hannibal Lecter. What does that have to do? That’s a representative of people that are coming into our country. Dr. Hannibal Lecter. He will have you for dinner. You know that? He will have you for dinner. No, but this is what’s happened. This is what’s happening at levels that nobody can even imagine.
(01:09:34)
Millions and millions. JD Vance is doing a phenomenal job today. He said 25 million. He’s doing a great job. I picked the best athlete. I had great people, and great people. We have so many wonderful people. Marco was incredible and Tim Scott was incredible. And you have a governor in a certain place that has a lot of oil. You know who I’m talking about. How good was he? And you have just great places, and great people, and I got to know so many. I picked JD, JD, and I could have picked anyone. They would’ve been great. But JD had an incredible life. He had a mother who was very addicted to prescription drugs and not a lot of help from the father. And he went to, he was a great student, however, very smart. He went to Ohio State, graduated at the top of his class in two years.
(01:10:28)
I said, two years. That’s pretty good. I never heard of that. Then he went into the military, then he came out, got accepted to Yale Law School, which is very hard to do without a father, without a father that has connections. Very hard to do, almost impossible. The reason he was accepted was that he was really smart. He was smart as hell. And then he worked, I guess, essentially on Wall Street or Wall Street alternative, or equivalent, and did very well. And then he ran for office. I endorsed him and he became a senator from the great state of Ohio. And he’s doing amazingly well, but he’s a brilliant guy. And the press went after him for about the first week, and then they gave up, because he has the answers.
(01:11:12)
He’s conservative, but he really is like all of us. We’re all sort of conservative, but what we really are is we have common sense. We have common sense. Common sense is more important, Ron, than anything else. We need common sense. We’d like to have borders. We don’t want crime. We want good schools. We want nice housing. We want low interest rates. It’s called, we don’t want wars. Ideally we don’t want wars. Everyone thought I’d be a warmonger. I was the opposite. But I did scare people away from having wars. And you know what I did? I used tariffs. I heard two countries were going to have a war. I called them both. I said, here’s the story. You have a war. You’re going to have to pay a 200% tariff to do business in the United States. And they’d both say, the leaders would say to me, almost simultaneously, we’ve decided to make peace. I stopped so many wars. They went to Viktor Orbán, the fake news. They went to Viktor Orbán and they said, why is the world such a mess right now? It’s flaming up in the Middle East and Israel. And what’s happened with Russia, Ukraine. Why is it? They said, you need Trump back in. He said, nobody understood Trump. China was afraid of him. Russia was afraid of him. I stopped the Nord Stream pipeline, Nord Stream 2. And then they say, I was very friendly with Russia. I got along good with sort of everybody, but everybody paid up. They had to pay up. We changed so many trade deals that was so bad. USMCA, we made that one. That was a great one from the worst trade deal we ever had. NAFTA, the worst trade deal any country probably has ever had, but we did a really good job.
(01:12:47)
But JD, we’re very proud of him. And he made a speech this morning and I heard it was great, and I think you will agree, Ron. He’s doing a fantastic job. As Vice President, Harris cast the tie-breaking votes that caused the worst inflation in American history costing a typical family $28,000. Think of that. Yesterday it was announced that we lost 438,000 full-time jobs in August. We lost 400, almost half a million jobs in August. We lost 24,000 manufacturing jobs, nearly 6,000 auto manufacturing jobs. And if I’m not elected, you will not have an auto industry at all. Volvo today announced they’re getting away from the electric. Other companies announced, we have paid trillions of dollars in subsidy for making these cars. And the market’s not there. That’s not there. It’s a shame, and I’m a big fan of electric cars. I think it’s great, but it’s got a market.
(01:13:45)
But I also want gasoline-powered cars, and I want hybrids. I want everything. Hydrogen is maybe coming. We want everything. The real unemployment rate rose to 7.9% in August. Did you know that? 7.9%. Our country’s going down. Last month alone, American-born workers lost 1.3 million jobs, and migrants gained 635,000 jobs in a single month. Every job that we’ve gained has been replaced, not by American citizens, but by illegal migrants. Did you know that? Every job that was created over the last fairly short period of time was taken by illegal migrants. And I will tell you this, the black population and the Hispanic population are being decimated by these people coming in unchecked, unbalanced. They’re coming in and they’re taking the black population and the Hispanic population jobs. And next is going to be unions. You watch the unions suffer. The autoworkers are not going to exist in a year and a half or two years because of what that fool did who’s the head of the autoworkers. He’s a fool. Since the start

Donald Trump (01:15:00):

… the start of this year, nearly 1 million Americans joined the unemployment roles. Nobody knows that. And, now, Kamala is pushing the largest individual small business tax in American history. And she said, “70 to 80% tax is probably a good idea, a bold idea that should be discussed.” 80%. Good luck with your small business. She and sleepy Joe Biden waged war on American energy, opened up the Russian pipeline, Nord Stream 2 after I had closed. It was done. It was closed. As soon as he came in, he approved it. But he shut down the Keystone XL Pipeline. Keystone, he shut it down, 48,000 jobs, and it was a very important pipeline actually, but we’ll get it open. But think of it. I shut down the biggest pipeline in the world, the Russian pipeline going to Germany and all over Europe. I shut it down. It was done. He gets in. He approved it. He approved it, but he shuts down the pipeline in this country, the XL Pipeline.
(01:16:02)
She reentered the horribly-unfair-to-the-United-States Paris Climate Accord. It sounds so nice. The Paris Climate Accord is such a nice name. Oh, isn’t that beautiful? We want the Wisconsin Accord. We want the people of Wisconsin, not the people of Paris. That Paris Accord was going to cost us $1 trillion. In other countries like China, it was considered third world. China. It’s a developing nation. They didn’t have to pay anything. India didn’t have to pay anything. Russia didn’t have to pay anything. France didn’t have to pay anything. Nobody had to pay. Only the stupid United States. We paid $1 trillion. And I closed it down and, as soon as he got back up, he opened it at even worse terms.
(01:16:48)
Kamala Harris and the Communist left have unleashed a brutal plague of bloodshed, crime, chaos, misery and death upon our land. And it’s only going to get worse as Vice President Harris has presided over a 43% increase in violent crime, including a 58% increase in rape. She supports to fund the police and, during the 2020 riots, she encouraged her followers to donate to bail criminals, looters, arsonists and murderers. She was trying to get the murderers out of jail. Right? You’re shaking. Right? Everybody now knows it. And this is a person that wants to be President of the United States. And she didn’t get a vote. As California Attorney General, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon and rape of an unconscious person as totally nonviolent crimes. Oh, that’s nice.
(01:17:45)
Kamala supports states being able to take minor children and perform sex change operation, take them away from their parents, perform sex-change operation and send them back home. Can you imagine you’re a parent and your son leaves the house and you say, “Jimmy, I love you so much. Go have a good day in school,” and your son comes back with a brutal operation? Can you even imagine this? What the hell is wrong with our country? Her running mate, Tampon Tim, did you see he signed a bill where tampons will be in every boy’s bathroom. Isn’t that nice? And he’s a whack job. You know they have a standard phrase that JD, who’s very solid, and I happen to be a very… I have other problems perhaps, but I’m a very solid person. But JD is solid. I’m solid.
(01:18:45)
They said this was just a sound bite. They gave it to all the fake news. The fake news, they’re weird. No. He’s weird. He is really weird, this guy. Can you imagine? I’m weird? You know they do soundbites and they give them… They gave one the other day a manufactured… The vote was manufactured. It’s not a term that’s used politically. Every network headed up something about the vote was manufactured. They follow the lead of these people. But we’ve got the lead. You know what? We’ve got the people.
(01:19:18)
We got to stop the cheating. If we stop that cheating, if we don’t let them cheat, I don’t even have to campaign anymore. We’re going to win by so much. In the meantime, too big to rig. Too big to rig. But he even signed… Tampon Tim even signed a law that allows abortion in the ninth month and babies to be executed after birth. In other words, the baby is born. And what do you do if the mother decides she doesn’t want the baby? You execute. That’s not an abortion. That’s an execution. And nobody wants that. There are six radical left states that allow that, too, that nobody wants it to happen. Nobody wants to see it happen where they’re allowed to execute the baby after birth, and nobody talks about it.
(01:20:04)
And we did a great thing when we got Roe v. Wade out of the federal government, got it back to the States, and, now, the states are all voting. And like Ronald Reagan, I happen to go with the exceptions. I think it’s important. But, other people, you have to go with your heart, but most… I’d say most people, 85% Republicans, they go with the exceptions for rape, incest, life of the mother, but… the three exceptions, but nobody wants to happen eighth month, seventh month, ninth month, but after birth, and you have after birth. And more people, more states are even planning on doing that.
(01:20:42)
Nobody wants that. And, now, what we’re doing is, because of what we’ve done, we’ve got, they wanted… All the great legal scholars wanted it out of the federal government. Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, everybody wanted it out because it didn’t belong there. They wanted it to go back to the States. And now the States are all voting. And, frankly, some of those votes are coming out very liberal if you look at Ohio, if you look at Kansas, if you look at some of the states. But the people are voting, and they’re voting. We put it in the hands of the people and they’re voting. And that’s the way people have wanted it for many, many years. And I’m just happy that we had Supreme Court justices that had the courage to do that because that has torn our country apart for 52 years and, now, the people are voting. From the moment we take back the White House from Comrade Kamala Harris, I believe we are going to have the four greatest years in the history of our country. We’re going to turn it around fast. Starting on day one, I will seal the border and stop the migrant invasion of our country. We will carry out the largest deportation operation of criminals in the history of America. We will defeat inflation, and we will make America affordable again. We will make America the dominant energy producer in the world by far. That’s called “Drill, baby, Drill.” Right? “Drill, baby, drill.”
(01:22:13)
And, remember, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country. In 12 months, I will cut your energy costs in half. That means, Wisconsin, we will cut it in half, and that includes your heating, air conditioning, electricity, gasoline for the cars. We’ll cut it in half, and we’ll do it easily. It won’t even be… I think we’ll do better than that 12 months. You can hold me to it. Hold me to it. I want you to hold me to it. We’re going to cut it in half.
(01:22:41)
I will turn the United States into a manufacturing superpower more than it has ever been. And other countries that make us pay a heavy tax to do business with them will be charged the same tax when they send their product into the United States. And we did it to a pretty strong extent when I was president, and we were going all the way that we had to solve the COVID problem, but we will be doing that. It will be called the Reciprocal Trade Act. It’s reciprocal. So, if China or any other country charges us a 100 or 200% tariff or tax, then we will likewise charge them a 100 or 200% tariff or tax in return. And my message is simple. Make your product here in America and only in America.
(01:23:34)
So we’re going to charge tariffs to all these foreign countries that are coming in and ripping us off and taking our jobs and destroying our manufacturing. And it’s what they do. We’re going to do it the same as they do. And some of these people that are making decisions in Washington, they’re very suspect, I can tell you. Not this group. This group. That’s why they’re here. They hate what they see happening. We’re not going to be taken advantage of anymore. Just as we made great inroads in progress four years ago, nobody ever made such progress as we. We had the greatest four years. We rebuilt the military. We had the largest tax cut in history, the largest regulation cut in history.
(01:24:15)
We had no wars. We had no wars. We didn’t get into any wars. Who would think, here I am, we didn’t? You know why? Because they were afraid of us and they respected us. They know not to mess with wars. And as I said, and I say it over and over again, Ukraine and Russia would have never happened. Israel would have never been attacked on October 7. Iran was broke. They were broke. Now you know they’re after me, so I should say, “Oh, I love Iran very much.” I don’t care. I got to do the right thing. Iran was broke. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for Hezbollah. They had no money for terror. Any of the many 28 different terror organizations, they had no money. They had no money whatsoever. They wouldn’t have ever even thought about doing Israel, all of the things that have happened.
(01:25:01)
And you know what else wouldn’t have happened? Inflation. You wouldn’t have had any inflation. Inflation was caused by energy going through the roof because these people were so stupid when they took over my energy policies. And energy was going through the roof, and then they went immediately back to my energy policies, Ron. They went immediately back, but what they don’t understand is, by now, I would’ve had energy at four times the amount that we had four years ago. And we were four years ago energy independent.
(01:25:33)
Who would believe that? Now, we get our energy from Venezuela. Did you see? They took his plane the other day. They took Maduro’s plane. Maduro is the dictator in charge. They took his plane. I said, “Oh, that’s so serious.” Now we can get a nicer plane because we buy our energy. So we give them billions and billions of dollars, and they take back a stupid old plane. This is the thinking we have in our country. We shouldn’t be buying oil from Venezuela. It’s unbelievable. But we’re not going to watch our wealth and our jobs get ripped away from us and sent to foreign countries. And Wisconsin will be one of the biggest beneficiaries just like I gave you the Marinette shipbuilding contract that everybody in the country wanted. Every state wanted it.
(01:26:21)
I’ll probably lose a couple of states because I gave it to Wisconsin. I’ll probably lose some states because I gave it to Wisconsin, but my plan is that, if you open your factory in Wisconsin or Pennsylvania or Michigan or Minnesota or anywhere else in the United States, you don’t pay a tariff or a tax. But if you move your production outside of the United States and send it back here, you have to pay a very substantial tariff.
(01:26:51)
We’re going to supercharge our country. We will charge other countries when their product is sent into our country. And why shouldn’t we? That’s exactly what they do. That’s what made China strong. When Elon goes and wants to send his cars into China that are made in the US, they say, “We don’t want them. You have to build your factory in China, then we’ll accept you.” Well, we’re saying to China, “You want to build cars? You want to send cars here? You’re going to build your factories in the United States. You’re not going to send them through, take our jobs, take everything else. You got to build them in the United States. You can open up a beautiful brand-new factory with American labor.” The result will be that everybody in the world will want to produce right here in the good old USA. We will be able to build ships again. We’ll be able to build planes again. We’ll be able to build our military again, all from within, all from within our country.
(01:27:46)
Do you know, when we build a plane, the F-35 fighter jet, I bought a lot of them for countries all over the world actually, but I bought a lot of them? We have parts made in all different countries and then they’re assembled here. We want to make the parts here. What would happen in case of a war and two of those countries were fighting and we say, “By the way, you can’t get the wings anymore?” The wings are made in Turkey, and other parts are made in other countries. It’s so crazy what they’ve done. And they did that to help out other countries. It’s now time for us to help out our country.
(01:28:21)
In the words of a very great but highly underrated President, William McKinley, “I am a tariff man standing on a tariff platform,” and he said that throwing open our market without protection was, quote, it destroys the dignity and independence of American labor, diminishes its pay and employment, decreases its capacity to buy products of farm and commodities of the merchant. It will bring widespread discontent. It will revolutionize values. It will take away more than half of our earning capacity of brain and brawn. Worse than that, it will take away from the people of this country who work for a living. And a majority of them live by the sweat on their faces. It will take from their heart and from their home, and it’ll take from their hope. Their final thing is their hope. It will be total self-destruction. This is the man that wanted tariffs. He wanted tariffs to be taken from foreign countries.
(01:29:22)
And you listen to some of our stupid people, and some of the very stupid people in Washington, DC, “We don’t want to charge tariffs. That’s not… It’s going to increase inflation.” China paid us hundreds of billions of dollars and we had almost no inflation. This group that came in, they had the highest inflation in the history of our country. We took in billions and billions of dollars from foreign countries in the form of tariffs that I hadn’t even gotten started yet. We’ll be a rich nation again. We’ll be able to do what we want to do. We have to do the tariffs. We have been treated so badly mostly by allies. If you want to know the truth, our allies treat us actually worse than our so-called enemies. But we have been treated so badly on trade and other things on military. We protect them, and then they screw us on trade. We’re not going to let it happen anymore. We’re going to be a tariff nation. It’s not going to be a cost to you. It’s going to be a cost to another country.
(01:30:21)
I heard Kamala the other day, Comrade Kamala. She said, “Oh, if you do that, he’s raising your taxes.” No. No. No. I’m not raising your taxes. I’m raising China and all of these countries in Asia and all over the world, including the European Union by the way, which is one of the most egregious. They don’t take our cars. They don’t take our farm product, and we have a $300-billion trade deficit with them. And they’re going to have to pay a price now because we’ve been supporting them for a long time and it’s no longer sustainable.
(01:30:57)
So I’m a tariff president. I’m not a tax- increase president because we’re going to lower your taxes when I’m back in the White House. We will pass large tax cuts for workers and also no tax on tips. No tax on tips. I will fight for you and fight for the ability. We are going to protect Social Security. We are going to protect Medicare, and we’re not going to have any cuts. We’re not going to have age increases. She’s going to have to. And a lot of these migrants that are coming in are going on to Social security and Medicare. Your programs are going to be destroyed. You’re not going to be able to get in your hospitals. You see the lines of people. You can no longer get in your hospitals. You feel sick. You want to go to your hospital. You have hundreds and even thousands of people trying to get into hospitals. They’re ruining your life. They’re ruining your lifestyle. They’re ruining your way of life.
(01:31:52)
I will have no tax on Social Security benefits for our seniors, because you’ve destroyed our seniors with your inflation. Inflation has destroyed our seniors and their social Security. We will terminate the Green New Scam and spend that money on roads, bridges, real infrastructure and paying down debt, not fake infrastructure that has caused massive inflation and has been of no benefit to our country. And I will settle the war in Ukraine. I will end the chaos in the Middle East, and I will prevent World War III. And I’m the only one that can do it. I will prevent World War III.
(01:32:35)
And if I don’t win this election, Israel, with Comrade Kamala Harris at the helm of the United States, is doomed. Israel is doomed. That’s a tough statement. Israel will be gone. One year, two years, Israel will no longer exist. I better win. I better win, or you’re going to have problems like we’ve never had. We may have no country left. It may be our last election. You want to know the truth? People have said that this may be our last election. You got to get out and vote. This could be our last election. It’ll all be over.
(01:33:09)
And you got to remember, I don’t want to say this because they say it’s braggadocious, but if you look at the record, it’s true, Trump is always right. I hate to be right. I hate to be right. I’m always right. I hate to be right. I don’t want to be right about the things that I predicted, but I predicted what was going to happen at the border. I predicted all of the inflation. I predicted everything that’s happened to our country. I predicted Israel. Putin would’ve never gone in, but I said, if I’m out, he’s going to attack Ukraine. But he would never have done it if I were there.
(01:33:43)
We will rebuild our cities including Washington, DC. Our cities are a mess, and they’re very dangerous places. We’re going to make them safe clean, and beautiful again. And we will keep the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And it is currently under major siege. Many countries are leaving the dollar. They’re not going to leave the dollar with me. I’ll say, “If you leave the dollar, you’re not doing business with the United States because we’re going to put a hundred percent tariff on your goods.” “Sir, we would like very much to get back to the dollar immediately. Thank you very much.”
(01:34:15)
It’s so easy. I don’t know. It’s so sad because nobody… Biden doesn’t know he’s alive, and she’s worse. This is how we will end the era of inflation, mayhem and misery under Kamala and Crooked Joe and unleash safety, prosperity and peace for Americans of every race, religion, color and creed. Together, we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates and low inflation so that everyone can afford groceries, a car and a home.
(01:34:44)
We will stop the invasion, end migrant crime, support our great police, strengthen our wonderful military, build a missile defense shield around our country, keep critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools. And we will keep men out of women’s sports.
(01:35:17)
Did you see the Olympics? You had two boxers that transitioned from men to women. I wish them well. They transitioned, and they were fighting. It was boxing for the gold medal, and the first match was a beautiful, young, Italian boxer, was very talented, very good, said to be a real threat for the medal, and she met a transitioned person. Boom. He gave her a little jab. Boom. She backed up. “Whoa. What was that?” She said, “I’ve never been hit that hard in my life.” A jab is like the light one before you hit the right. Then, boom, another jab. She said, “I can’t… I give up.” Then there was a second boxer. The same thing happened. Congratulations. They both won gold medals. How about that? They both won gold. Congratulations to them. It’s so demeaning to women. I don’t understand. Who would want men to be able to play? The volleyball player got hit the other day recently with a smash from a transitioned person. She said, “I’ve never seen anything like it at the ball camp.” She was knocked unconscious, probably won’t play again. The weightlifting records tell, for years, they held up, they couldn’t. A quarter of an ounce here, a quarter of an ounce there, they couldn’t do it. The record is broken by hundreds of pounds.
(01:36:43)
We got to get back to sanity in this country. We have to get back to sanity. We will defend the Second Amendment, restore free speech, and we will secure our elections once and for all. Everyone will prosper. Every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with joy, opportunity, and hope. But for that to happen, we must defeat Comrade Kamala Harris. And we are going to stop the country-destroying liberal agenda once and for all. We’re going to do it. We have to stop it. We’re going to save our country.
(01:37:16)
Our country, if it doesn’t win this election, I believe is finished. I believe it. We cannot come back much. They will have a hundred million of these people in here, with another four years, a hundred million people. If you think you have a nice house, have a migrant enjoy your house because a migrant will take it over. A migrant will take it over. It will be Venezuela on steroids.
(01:37:39)
So get everyone you know and vote. We want a landslide that’s too big to rig on November 5th. We will save our economy. We will rescue our middle class. We will reclaim our sovereignty and restore our borders. We will put America first, and we will take back our country. Together, we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again.
(01:38:15)
Thank you, Bobby. Thank you, Bobby. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. We will make America free again, and we will make America great again.

Donald Trump (02:16):

Thank you very much. I’m thrilled to be back with the hardworking patriots of the great state of Michigan, United States. I also want to thank Alro Steel CEO, Randy Glick. Just met Randy and he’s fantastic. The job the family’s done, he’s done, it’s beautiful. And all of the talented workers here at Alro Steel, I hope you’re all happy. Are you happy with the company? I think yes? I think. Great company. And congratulations on 76 years of manufacturing in Michigan. And you had your best years four years ago, but you’re going to have even better years coming up, I can tell you that. You’re going to have even better. I’m here today with a simple message for the American autoworker and for the American worker: Your long economic nightmare will very soon be over. It’s going to be over. Going to turn it around. With your vote, we will defeat comrade Kamala Harris, and we will bring back the American dream bigger, better, stronger, and just better. Bigger, better. We love the American dream. You don’t hear about the American dream. When’s the last time you heard about the American dream? They don’t talk about it, although they copy everything else I do, so I guess that’ll be next. They’ll be copying. They’ll be saying, “Oh, the American dream.” She doesn’t know what the American dream is.
(03:41)
Over the past four years, Kamala and crooked Joe Biden have presided over an economic reign of terror, committing one financial atrocity after another. As Vice President, Kamala cast the deciding votes that caused the worst inflation in American history. You’re all victims of it. We all are. Everybody is a victim of it. It’s a nation buster costing the typical family $28,000. Under her policies, household wealth has plummeted by $33,000 per family. The cost of the typical monthly mortgage has really tripled and you can’t get the money.
(04:19)
So we will go from 2% to 10%, but you can’t get the money at 10%. I guess they want more than that, but you just can’t get the money. Credit card debt has ballooned by 40% and they have the highest numbers in history right now. As about three days ago, the highest number in history. Now, Kamala says she wants to talk about the future, but she’s been there for three and a half years. She only wants to talk about the future because the past has been so… The job they’ve done, let me tell you, he’s the worst president in the history of our country and she’s the worst vice president and she’s the worst border czar in the history of the world, and she’s the one who gave us every single disaster that our country is facing right now.
(05:05)
Look at Afghanistan. She said, “I was the last person in the room.” What a horrible, horrible event that was. Kamala’s made middle-class life unaffordable and unlivable, and I’m going to make America affordable again. In addition to making it great again, we’re going to make it affordable again. And that’s going to be starting on day one. Isn’t it amazing? They go three years and now they say, “Oh, we’re going to do this. We’re going to do that.” The only good thing that she’s… flip-flopping. She’s the greatest flip-flopper. Things that she never even thought of. She probably goes back to her room and gets sick to her stomach when she says what she has to say because she’s a Marxist, she’s a fascist, and she never believed him. And now she’s saying, “Oh, we want to build a strong border.” Where has she been for three and a half years as we took in 20 million people, many of them horrible criminals?
(06:02)
My vision is for a middle class that is once again the envy of the entire world. It’s going to happen. It’s going to happen fast.
(06:14)
Thank you.
(06:14)
Workers like you and communities like this should be able to afford a nice house, a new car, and a growing family on a single income all while enjoying the highest standard of living on earth, right?
(06:29)
Thank you. Americans deserve safe streets, secure borders, great schools, healthy children, bustling factories, and a nation that is confident and a nation that is strong. That’s the future that I intend to deliver and I will deliver. And you had the best economy in the history of our country just a short while ago, and now you have what they call inflation, what that has done to this country. And frankly, they’ve done also worse. And you’re going to end up in World War III with these people. I’ll tell you what, we’ve never been so close to World War III.
(07:06)
And with the power of weapons, I always say this isn’t two army tanks running back and forth shooting at each other. The power of weapons today, very dangerous, very bad. We have people… We don’t even… Do we have a president? He just got back from California. He was supposed to go to the White House. He never got there. He went to Delaware and he’s laying on a beach sleeping all day long. No, seriously, who the hell wants to sleep and who wants to sleep in public? He’s sleeping. Do you think President Xi of China is at a beach sleeping? Do you think Kim Jong Un is sleeping from North Korea with his nuclear weapons all over the place? They don’t sleep so much. And we have a guy sleeping.
(07:49)
And she’s… Look, she’s incompetent. She can’t do an interview. It’s been months. I just did an interview backstage. Was a very terrible person, but she was okay actually, NBC fake news. It was NBC fake news. She asked me about all sorts of things. She asked me about abortion and I handled it very nicely. Because you know what? That’s so overplayed. We have abortion. We have the whole thing brought back into the states where it belongs. That’s where everybody wanted it for years and years and years and they’re voting on it. And I happen to believe in the exceptions Ronald Reagan did, for life of the mother, rape, incest, the exceptions. Probably 90% of the people do.
(08:34)
I was just telling this reporter the real problem and the real radicals on that issue are the Democrats where you can have an abortion in the ninth month. And in six states you’re allowed to kill the baby after the baby is born. And one of those states is Minnesota, where this tampon Tim comes from. Kill the baby after the baby’s born. So that’s no longer abortion. That’s called execution. You’re allowed to execute the baby after the baby… They’re the radical.
(09:06)
Kamala is promising communist-style price controls, free taxpayer-funded healthcare. Not that you’re going to want. Nobody in this room is going to want it. For all illegal aliens mass amnesty and citizenship for the millions and millions of migrants she let’s in. She wants to give citizenship to people that have come here illegally. They didn’t come through the system. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. They have to come in legally.
(09:35)
We’re taking people that are murderers and drug dealers. She wants to give them amnesty. I tell you, I don’t get it. But all of this will destroy Medicare and will destroy your social security. She called for the abolition of ICE. You know ICE? These are great patriots. These are tough people. I’m looking at some of these people right in the front row, they’re tough as hell, but you don’t want to be in ICE. You don’t want to walk into MS-13 gangs and start slugging it out. These guys are seriously tough and they love our country. Somebody’s got to do it.
(10:09)
I took them out by the thousands. Now they don’t want to take them out anymore. They want to let ICE… The worst gang probably in the world, the meanest, the nastiest. They slice up people with knives. They’d rather use a knife than a gun because it’s more painful. They killed two young students walking to school, two beautiful young sixteen-year-old girls walking to school. They sliced them up in Long Island. And they want to let these people stay. And we’re not going to let them stay. We want to get them the hell out of our country.
(10:40)
Kamala sponsored a bill to blow up the entire U.S. healthcare system and force every American into a socialist government-run program with rationing and deadly wait times. You go there and they say, “That’s good. We’re going to be all set for you. Come back in three months.” She endorsed a 70 to 80% tax rate increase. Look at this. She thinks the rate, actually the rate could be as much as 80%. She says, “I’ll think about that.” Well, I won’t think about it. I won’t think about anywhere near it. In fact, we’re going for a tax cut. We gave you the biggest tax cut in history and that gave us tremendous numbers of jobs. And we actually took in more income the following year after the cut because our country was booming like it had never boomed before.
(11:26)
She supports abolishing cash bail so that when you murder somebody, “Oh, don’t worry about it, you’re free to go.” No cash, no nothing. And then they go murder somebody else. And in some cases, much more than one person. And she endorsed the Marxist crusade to defund the police. Do you know that she was the leader of the defund the police? Does anybody in Michigan… I said, “Why don’t I just walk up…” I don’t have to waste a lot of time. You’re all fans, right? Is anybody here not going to vote for Trump? I’m just kidding. Raise your hand if you have the courage to do that. I think pretty good.
(12:03)
No, but I said, “Why do I have to make a speech?” All I have to do is say she was the leader of the defund the police movement. And then I say, “Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much” and leave. Because when you hear that… No, she’s a Marxist. Her father’s a Marxist. He’s a Marxist professor. It’s very nice.
(12:23)
This election is not a choice between Democrats and Republicans. It’s a choice between communism and freedom. That’s what it’s about. And nobody really knows her. They were doing something, the Man on the Street, they said, “You know Harris?” Everyone’s saying, “Who the hell is Harris?” Nobody knows who Harris is. “What’s the vice president’s name?” They have no idea what the name is. Now the name Kamala, it’s a little complex because about 19 different ways of pronouncing it. But Kamala is… At least it’s a name you sort of remember. You can’t use Harris because nobody knows who the hell Harris is. Who’s Harris?
(13:03)
We want somebody they know. And one of the reasons they don’t know, she did a lousy job. She was considered the worst vice president in history. I don’t know who does this stuff, but she was considered the worst. Kamala will turn America into a Third World country. Will happen. It’s already getting there, I hate to tell you. When you look at our borders, when you look at our elections, our rigged elections, when you look at all the crap that’s going on, we’re turning into a Third World… When you look at how they go weaponize against me by doing absolutely nothing wrong.
(13:38)
I got indicted, I think nine different times. Nine times. I never even knew what an indictment was for my whole life. All of a sudden, the last year, I think I had nine indictments, far more than Alphonse Capone, who was quite well known in Chicago and the environs. He liked killing people, but he had nothing like me. Nine times. And every time they see me going up in the polls and we’re leading in the polls and I think we’re leading by a lot… The polls are rigged too. The polls are rigged too. They say Donald Trump is tied. Tied. We were up massively by Biden. How would you like to be me? I spent a hundred million dollars on beating Biden. We had a debate and everybody said, “This guy’s shot.”
(14:27)
They never give me credit. They say he was shot. Maybe I did a good job. Somebody said, “That was the greatest debate performance I’ve ever said.” And then, you know what… That I’ve ever seen, said, it was a CNN person said, “This is the single greatest debate performance I’ve ever seen.” Two days later they forgot about that. They said he was terrible. But that’s all right. Whatever it takes.
(14:49)
But I spent a hundred million dollars on fighting him. We weren’t fighting anyone else. We weren’t fighting a vice president. We didn’t even know who the hell she was. And then all of a sudden they say, “Joe, you’re losing badly. You got to get out.” He was losing by a lot. But they went up to him. They said, “Get out.” That’s like you’re in a fight and you have a fighter and he’s doing great. And they say, “Listen, we’re going to take the opponent out. We’re going to throw another guy in to finish it off.” That’s what they did really. It’s never been done before.
(15:15)
And she was last online and she came in last. I think there were 22 people. She was the first one to get out. And she got out, she had no votes. She had no votes. She went to… Was supposed to go to Iowa. She quit before Iowa. That was the first state. She never made it to Iowa. And now she’s running, and what about those other 20 or so people? They did much better than her. And they’re saying… They’re sitting home watching television, but they’re having a big discussion now because they don’t understand why she refuses to sit down for just an interview. And they’ve got a lot of friendly… It’s much easier being a Democrat because you see all the fake news back there.
(15:58)
If you’re a Democrat, they say, ” He just gave the greatest speech that we ever heard. Not since FDR has there been a speech.” I saw this with Biden. He made a State of the Union Address. It was so bad. Oh, it was so bad. I saw her make a speech. It was so bad. And after they get off, “This was one of the greatest performances we’ve ever seen in our country.”
(16:21)
With me, I make a speech, I speak for two hours. Everybody loves it. I got thousands of people, by the way, outside trying to get in. They never said, “Trump’s a great speaker.” I don’t even want that, but I must be a great speaker. I must. We got thousands of people. No, we got thousands and thousands. Boy, if I were a Democrat, they’d say he’s the greatest that ever lived. He made Abraham Lincoln look like nothing. But no, I don’t care about that. I care about winning for our country. I care about making America great again, and that’s what we’re going to do.
(16:59)
So we’re pleased to be joined today by some really great winners, champions, patriots, and one of them is Lisa McClain, Congresswoman. Where’s Lisa? Hi Lisa. You are doing amazing. I’ll tell, don’t be fooled by her. She’s a very nice person, but she’s brutal when it comes to your state, when it comes to jobs, right, Lisa? And she’s proud of it too.

Lisa McClain (17:26):

Absolutely.

Donald Trump (17:26):

Yep, she is. Thank you. Great job. And another man that I picked out of a large group, I said, “This guy’s got what it takes.” He’s a highly respected person. He’s running for the U.S. Senate, and I think he’s going to win. I just saw a poll where he’s leading by a little bit. It’s not an easy race. It’s not an easy race, but the other one is going to be just a disaster. She’s going to vote everything that whoever it would be, except me, they won’t, but hopefully we’re not going to need it. But she’s a disaster. Mike Rogers is

Donald Trump (18:00):

… one of the most respected people in Washington and he will be, I believe, your next senator. Great friend. He’s actually one of the most respected people in Washington, and he came out of a large group of Republicans that all wanted the same job. He ran a great race. Won easily. He had my endorsement. That helped. But he did. He won easily and he’s got great gravitas. Your next congressman, and you’re going to have a great congressman who I think is going to win, Tom Barrett. Tom. Thank you, Tom. Great job. I heard you’re doing well, Tom. Good. Running against somebody that’s not good. Not good for your state, not good for our country. Michigan House Republican leader, Matt Hall. Are we going to win, Matt? He gave me a good summary. I said, “You’re going to win, sir.”
(18:59)
They have these fake polls. They’re almost as bad as the fake writers, the fake news. “We interviewed 49 Democrats for a poll. We interviewed 49 Democrats and 21 Republicans.” It’s a little thing on the bottom. I’m surprised they even put it. It probably must be a law, but they put it. 49 Democrats and 21 Republicans, and the race is tied. They said tied. How the hell can it be tied? So tied means I’m leading by like 14 or 15 points. I don’t know, but it’s fake news. It’s as bad as they are with a pen. I’m telling you, it’s really bad. They can make those polls sing. They can make them do whatever they want. Michigan Senate Republican leader, Eric Nesbitt. Eric, thank you. Great job. What a beautiful young daughter. What a beautiful young daughter. Great. Thanks, Eric. Thanks very much.
(19:56)
We also have some people of great distinction. Justice David Viviano is here with us. David. Thank you, David. Highly respected justice. Thank you, David. Judge Patrick O’Grady. Patrick is here someplace. Where’s Patrick? Another one. Highly respected. So whatever you’re doing, keep it going. Good. And Tudor Dixon, who really ran a good race. Where is Tudor? Hi, Tudor. She’s a great person, loves this state and loves the workers. I knew her father. Her father was in the steel business. Successful guy. I knew him as he was leaving our planet. He was very sick and leaving, but he loved his daughter. He was so proud of you, so he’s up there watching. Thank you very much, Tudor. I appreciate it.
(20:54)
And Brian Pannebecker, who’s a friend of mine. This guy. Where is he? Where’s Brian? Where is he? Do you want to come up? Come on up here, Brian. This guy, he thinks the United Auto Workers have the worst leader and that they’re crazy. They’re going to be driven out of business. All the business is going to China. Within two, three years, you’re not going to have auto workers in this. If they vote for Trump, we’re going to bring in factories at levels that you’ve never seen before. We’re going to get the auto workers’ jobs back like it was 30 years ago and 40 years ago before everybody left. We’re going to get it back at levels that you’ve never seen. Brian, say hello, please.

Brian Pannebecker (21:39):

Thank you, Mr. President. And the last time you called me up on stage in Grand Rapids, it was the first rally that you’d held since the assassination attempt. And honestly, I was speechless. But tonight, I want to say a couple of things real briefly. I represent the Auto Workers for Trump organization, which was a Facebook group. I started that group. I started that group. Thank you. There are some auto workers here, I’m sure. Lansing has got a lot of them. But unfortunately, a lot of them have lost their jobs. Listen, Chrysler and General Motors have already gone bankrupt once, but if we allow electric vehicle mandates to be put on this industry by the federal government, they’re going out of business again. We got to fight against that. And this guy standing right here is the only person who will do it. We cannot allow the federal government to put mandates on the auto industry to build electric vehicles when the consumers do not want them.
(22:41)
So I’m asking everybody, I’m asking auto workers and I’m asking everybody that supplies the auto industry, get 10 or 15 of your friends, make sure they get out and vote. Our very survival depends on it and we can’t allow it to happen. So vote Trump and J.D. Vance and we’ll turn this country around. He’s done it once. Unfortunately, he’s going to have to go back and do it again. Thank you.

Donald Trump (23:10):

As he’s speaking, look at the arms of this guy.

Brian Pannebecker (23:13):

Cut it out.

Donald Trump (23:14):

Look at that-

Brian Pannebecker (23:15):

Cut it out.

Donald Trump (23:17):

He’s really great and a real patriot. And it’s true. They’re building, I don’t know if you know, numerous of the biggest auto plants in the world right now in near-

Brian Pannebecker (23:26):

In Mexico.

Donald Trump (23:27):

… right near the border in Mexico, owned by China. They think they’re going to build the cars and send them in. And with this administration, they won’t even know what’s happening. They’ll take every single job. You’re not going to have any auto workers within two years, maybe three years. Nobody’s going to be making cars here. I told them, “If you do that, we’re going to put tariffs on a 200, 250%. You’re never going to sell one car in this country.” And they didn’t build them. And then as soon as I left, because of a bad situation that happened, because we did great in this state too.

Brian Pannebecker (23:58):

Yeah, you won it.

Donald Trump (23:58):

But a bad situation that happened. Corrupt, bad situation. You have to keep your eyes open this time. But they used COVID to cheat. Very simple. They used COVID to cheat. But I told them, I said, “You do it, you’re not going to sell any cars.” As soon as I was gone, they started construction and they’re almost finished, and that’s going to wipe you out. They’re the biggest plants anywhere in the world. A friend of mine builds plants and I think he’s building these. I said, “I want to see some big plants. I want to go and tour some of the big auto plants.” That’s all he does. Honestly, he’s a great guy. Can’t walk across the street. He can build a plant like nobody.
(24:33)
He said, “Sir, you’re going to have to come to Mexico.” I said, “No, I want to see one in the United States.” He said, “The big ones are being built in Mexico.” That’s no good. And we’re not going to let it happen. They can build their plant. They’re not going to have any cars coming into this country. If they want to build a plant, they can. They’re going to build it in Michigan, or at least some in our country. Thank you.

Brian Pannebecker (24:56):

The UAW members realize this now, and I’m doing a rally at a different auto plant every week. I started in June. We’re going to go all the way to November and we’re talking to the auto workers as they come off their shift and go into work. And 70 or 80% of are voting for Donald Trump, because they know their jobs depend on it.

Donald Trump (25:18):

Wow. He’s a dynamic guy, isn’t he, huh? Really, look, I didn’t know Brian. He just knows that we had four great years, but I got an award years ago in Michigan. I got Man of the Year a long time ago. In fact, the fake news said I never got it. I never got it. I made it up. I didn’t make it up. And then they found out that I actually did get it. I was lucky. They found out who it was. It was a chamber of commerce someplace. And I gave a whole speech. This was probably 15 years ago, 17 years ago. I gave a speech on why are you letting them steal your auto manufacturing business? And it only got worse and worse and worse, and I stopped it. And then as soon as I was gone, they let it happen. And these plants that are being built all around the world are going to take all of your business. And I’m a big fan of electric cars, but they’re limited. They don’t go far. They’re very expensive, and they can all be made in China because they have the material.
(26:14)
But we have more liquid gold under our feet than anybody else. It’s called gasoline for what we talk about. And we want to build gasoline propelled cars, but we also want to build hybrids and we want to build electric cars. Elon Musk, I think he’s great, and he endorsed me very strongly. I said, “Listen, I’m all for electric cars, but not all of them because they really don’t go far yet.” But they’re incredible. The job he’s done and the job that others have done a great, and it’s called a market. You have to be able to buy what you want to buy. There’ll be another form of car. They talk about hydrogen now. They talk about all sorts of things, but it’s called a market. But we can’t do that. They want to put, and immediately, all electric cars, but we don’t have enough electricity to supply ourselves right now. You go out to California, which was destroyed by Kamala. Destroyed. She destroyed the city of San Francisco. And I own a big building there. I shouldn’t talk about this, but that’s okay. I don’t give a damn because this is what I’m doing.
(27:22)
I should say it’s the finest city in the world. Get the hell out of there. But I can’t do that. I don’t care. I lost billions of dollars. Somebody said, “What do you think you lost?” I said, “Probably two, 3 billion. That’s okay. I don’t care.” They said, “Do you think you’d do it again?” And that’s the least of it. They always say that, I don’t know if you know, Lincoln was horribly treated. Jefferson was pretty horribly. Andrew Jackson they say was the worst of all, that he was treated worse than any other president. And I said, “Do that study again, because I think there’s nobody close to Trump.” I even got shot. And who the hell knows where that came from? No, these are bad people. They’re sick people. We have people on the outside, the countries. But if you have a smart president, the countries will be an asset, not a liability. That includes China, that includes Russia. If you have a smart president.
(28:19)
But we don’t have a smart president right now, by the way. You can end up in World War III. This period of time better happen fast, because we have nobody running our country. We have nobody at the Resolute Desk. There’s nobody. The two of them. She’s no good, and he’s sleeping. In fact, I’m going to go back to the name for him Sleepy Joe instead of Crooked Joe. Did you see they found last week, Brian, he took $28 million? They say his family took 28 million and nothing happened. That was the night he made his brilliant speech, which was all about Trump. Everything they do, they talk about Trump. They talk about Trump I think 347 times. They talked about the border once. They talked about crime twice. They talked about all of the things that you should be talking about not at all. But they talk about Trump.
(29:13)
And look, we did something that they’re very angry about. We beat somebody that should have been beaten in an election that we weren’t anticipated to win. But I thought we were going to win, because I came to Michigan the night before. We had 49,000 people. She came to Michigan the night before because she was told she may lose it. And this was an upset, so they had a fast tour. She had like 300 people. I said, “Why would we lose?” We had the crowd you wouldn’t have believed it. Half of you were probably there. But we’re also joined by a very incredible service member. I presented him with a thing called the Congressional Medal of Honor. And he is a fantastic man, and he’s a good-looking guy. I don’t know. He looks better than he did when I presented. Something’s good. He’s doing good. Specialist Five James McCloughan. Where’s James? James. Thank you, James. Look good. Good head of hair. Look at him. Got that good Irish, Scottish, whatever hair. Look at that guy. Stand up. Just stand up. Come here. I’m proud of him.
(30:26)
I wouldn’t have done what he did. I know what he did. What he did. I always say there are two awards is the Medal of Honor, and oftentimes it’s posthumously where they’re not there. Oftentimes they’ve died in battle and they’re getting the award. And then you have the civilian version, the Presidential Medal. And I always say, I’d rather get the Presidential Medal because the guys that came in, other than you and a few others, oftentimes they’ve suffered greatly. They’ve suffered greatly or they’re not around. But it’s our highest award and it’s an honor to have you here, and I’m very proud that I was able to give you the award. Thanks, James.
(31:11)
In four short years under my leadership, we passed record tax cuts, record regulation cuts, and built the greatest economy in the history of the world. I ended NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made. You people had to suffer with it for years. And replaced it with the USMCA, that’s Mexico and Canada, which they say is the best trade deal ever made. Actually, the best deal I made probably was with China, but I don’t talk about it because once COVID came in, that was the end of China. Once they did that to the world, not to us, to the whole world, $59 trillion of damages and millions and millions of people. And it came out of Wuhan, the lab. It came out of the labs, and that’s where I said it came from. And it was incompetence. It was a mistake. I believe it was a mistake.
(31:59)
A lot of people don’t think so. A lot of people think they did it because I was getting hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs from China. No president had ever gotten anything from China. I got hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and saved a lot of jobs by doing that, because they ended up not being able to do what they were doing. And I saved the steel industry also, as you know. Those are the guys that like me the most. But now I see U.S. Steel, the great U.S. Steel, U.S. Steel is being sold to Japan. I don’t like that. Can you imagine U.S. Steel? That was the greatest company in the world 70 years ago, 60-something years ago. U.S. Steel is going to be sold to Japan. I wouldn’t let it happen. I just wouldn’t let it happen. Such a big benchmark that shouldn’t be going to Japan. They should rebuild it. They should do whatever they have to do. We’d work with them, we’d make it great again, just like we’re going to make our country great again.
(32:58)
But it’s energy, because they came in and they wanted to terminate everything I was doing and the prices were going through the roof for gasoline and everything. So they said, “Put it back. Put it back.” So it all came back, or most of it came back, maybe not to the same, but pretty close. They said, “Go back.” After the election, if they’ve won, it’s all gone. But what they don’t say is they’ll say, “Oh, but we have the similar to Trump.” And that’s sort of true, but what they don’t have is they don’t have ANWR. They gave up ANWR, the biggest site anywhere in the world in Alaska that I got done. Ronald Reagan couldn’t get it done. But really, most importantly, what they don’t have is we were going to be four to five times bigger by now. So when they say they had it back, they only had it back to where I was. We were going to have so much energy coming out of the ground, so much liquid gold. We were going to pay off debt. We’re going to reduce your taxes further.
(33:54)
I mean, we have more liquid gold than Saudi Arabia. We have more than Russia. And we were going to use it. And you know where we’re getting a lot of our energy now? Venezuela. It’s tar. You know that? It’s tar. And you know where it’s refined? There’s only one plant in the entire world that can do it. It happens to be in Houston, Texas. So for those of you that don’t like particles going into the air, take a look at that mess. And we have clean, beautiful stuff. We have the best. We have the best, we have the most, and we don’t use it. We go to electric or we go to something else. You almost say, “Do they hate our country?” because it’s so incompetent. “Do they hate our country?” The first thing I will do to make middle-class life dramatically more affordable is to end Kamala’s war on American energy, terminate her green new scam, and drill, baby, drill. We’re going to drill, baby, drill.
(34:53)
Since Harris took office, more than 50 power plants have been shut down. Many of these were great plants, but they didn’t like the way they were fueled up. Many of them are needed to create electricity. It starts from somewhere. It doesn’t start from electricity. And by the way, just a little side note. AI is a big deal. For us to compete successfully with China and others on AI, we’re going to need twice the electricity that we currently produce. Can you believe that? We’re not going to be even close. The only guy that can do that is a guy like me. I opened up plants. I opened up two plants in Louisiana that went through 14 years… LNG plants. They went through 14 years of approvals and were turned down. I got it done in one day. One day. We got it opened.
(35:43)
Those owners, whoever they were, they were actually people going to spend $16 billion. It’s the Empire State Building on its side times three. The longest, biggest buildings you’ve ever seen. All they had is pipes inside. I said, “What the hell kind of a building is

Donald Trump (36:00):

… this, but you know what? Billions of dollars. And they got turned down. I got it approved. And one of them, one day, the owner or the head of the company couldn’t believe it, he said, “I got a call.” I guarantee you, a consultant somewhere that represented them. So I did a great job. I didn’t speak to consultants, I just got it done. And now they’re up and they’re roaring, and they’re just fantastic.
(36:20)
Under Kamala’s radical power plant rule, issued by the EPA, all coal-fired power plants will be forced to close in the next few years. What are you going to do? Gutting more than one-sixth of the power. And really, we’re going to go to a very weak form of producing power. We don’t have energy that can power up those big massive plants that we need, including the ones right here in Michigan. You don’t have the energy.
(36:46)
Wind is wonderful if you like high cost, if you like having to replace the windmills every nine years. They wear out, and they’re very intermittent. And they do kill a hell of a lot of birds. If you want to see a lot of dead birds, go to a windmill and just look underneath. You’ll see birds all over the place. The same rule has frozen virtually all new investment in large natural gas projects, setting us up for a horrible shortage of at least 30% of our electrical grid capacity in the future. So we’re going to have much less in the future.
(37:17)
We’re closing down all our plants, just like trucks. They want you to make electric trucks. And the truckers come to see me, “Sir, they don’t work.” One man had 29,000. He said, “I started with nothing. I have 29,000 trucks.” And he said, “I’d buy trucks, and every year, they got better. They got more efficient. They got stronger. They got more beautiful. I started building apartments in the back of the cabs, right? You know what that is?” He said, “Sir, you’re rich, but you would’ve loved some of these apartments.”
(37:48)
I said, “No, thanks, but that’s okay. No, it’s beautiful. This stuff is fantastic.”
(37:53)
“We had four or five companies.”
(37:55)
I said, “Which one did the best?”
(37:56)
He said, “They all do good, sir, but now they want us to go to electric trucks. And I’ll have to stop six times on the way to California from New York. Six times. And sir, they weigh two and a half times more than a gasoline or than a diesel-powered truck.”
(38:13)
And I said, “So what does that mean?”
(38:14)
He said, “That means you’re going to have to rebuild every bridge and every major roadway in the country, just because of the weight. And they’re very inefficient, and the battery is much bigger than the tank.” And he was telling me, the battery would take up at least half of the area right now that they use for hauling.
(38:31)
I said, “So when you tell people that you’d have to rebuild every bridge in America, that you’d have to rebuild the roads, the tank, that you have to stop six times from New York to California?”
(38:41)
He said, “With a load of diesel, a good truck can go all the way, and even start their way back. That’s how good it is.” And he said this, it was amazing, because he said it right from the heart. He said, “If they make us do this, I’ll be out of business. We’ll all be out of business. Your supply chain will be a disaster if they made us do this. Every year that I bought a truck, it was better. They got better, better, better. We will have gone back 70 or 80 years. We’ll have trucks that don’t go far. We’ll have trucks that don’t work well. We’ll have trucks that can carry a very small payload, because of the size of the batteries and the weight.”
(39:22)
So I said, “Well, when you tell these officials this, what do they say?” They say, “We don’t care. You’re going all electric.” So let’s see, do we have any children? If you had a child, a beautiful boy in the green shirt… And he’s not so little, he’s a big boy, he’s going to be a big one, but… If you said to a child, “It doesn’t go far. It weighs too much. The payload’s no good, and lots of other problems, and they’re much more expensive,” he would say, “Let’s stay with diesels.” Right?
(39:58)
These guys say, “We don’t care.” Then they want to make our Army tanks all electric. And the problem is they don’t go far. They’re the wrong torque. And you know where they want the battery? Because the battery’s massive. You pull a wagon, a child pulls away, they want to build a wagon at the back, so it pulls the battery along. So they want to be environmentally friendly as we blast our way into a country that we hate. We want to take on these countries and be environmentally friendly. These people are deranged. They’re deranged people.
(40:32)
I will be the American energy president. I’ll be a president for a lot. I’m going to be the automobile manufacturing president, too. You watch. And it won’t even be hard. I can do it with a pen. I can do it with a pen. Come in and build your plants in the United States, preferably here. But come in and build your plants in the United States of America. And if you don’t, you’re not allowed to sell cars here, and we’re going to tax you at 150 or 200%. I did that with steel. And people are going to flow in.
(41:05)
And the head of your union, who’s absolutely terrible, I mean, give him an IQ test. This guy doesn’t know what is happening. He’s horrible. Sean Fain, he’s horrible. What a terrible job. He sold out the union, and they automatically endorse Democrats for many, many years. But if you look at your car industry now and 25 years ago, it’s like a different world. What you’ve lost is so bad. We can get it all back. We can get so much of it back, because you’re still the big market.
(41:35)
And that’s why we have to do it fast, because we have to remain the big market. The way we’re going with this country, we’re going to lose that. We’re going to lose our currency values. We’re going to lose the dollar standard. If we lose the dollar standard, that’s like losing a war. If we don’t have the dollar standard, we are a Third World country. My goal will be to cut your energy costs in half within 12 months after taking office. So we can do that. If you have the oil supply, which we have more than anybody, your heating and air conditioning, electricity, gasoline, all can be cut down in half. Your gasoline, I had it down to $1.87. I had moments when it was much lower than that.
(42:14)
To achieve this rapid reduction in energy costs, I will declare a national emergency to allow us to dramatically increase energy production, generation, and supply, which Comrade Kamala has destroyed. She’s destroyed it. Starting on day one, I will approve new drilling, new pipelines, new refineries, new power plants, new reactors. And we will slash the red tape. We will get the job done. We will create more electricity, also, for these new industries that can only function with massive electricity. And we’ll get it done.
(42:54)
And nobody else is even going to come close. They won’t even try. And if they did try, nothing would happen. Under President Trump, America’s future will be energy abundance, energy independence. And soon we will be energy-dominant. We’re going to be dominant, much more so than Russia. We started off number three. By the time I left, we were number one by a lot, and we were going to be doubling and tripling them up. The cutting of ANWR was a shame. Ronald Reagan tried to get it. He couldn’t get it. Every president, they all tried to get ANWR in Alaska. I got it. They think the size of Alaska in terms of what’s under there.
(43:33)
And in the first week in office, he terminated it. I got it all done. There were all sorts of drilling. Took him a year and a half. They got everything perfect. They were all starting in Alaska to drill. And what a shame that is. ANWR could have been maybe the biggest site in the world, but we’re going to get it back. It’ll be back very quickly. I promise you that. Because I know the roadmap. I know that roadmap very well. People said, “I can’t believe you got ANWR. Ronald Reagan couldn’t get. Nobody could get it.” And it was easier then, because now you have the environmental stuff.
(44:05)
We want more babies, to put it very nicely. And for this same reason, we will also allow new parents to deduct major newborn expenses from their taxes, so that parents that have a beautiful baby will be able. So we’re pro-family. Nobody’s ever said that before, but the IVF treatments are expensive. It’s very hard for many people to do it, and to get it. But I’ve been in favor of IVF right from the beginning. If you talk to them, they’ll say, “Oh, he really doesn’t like…” They even have the ads, like I’m against it. It’s just the opposite.
(44:44)
By comparison, they’re against it, but I’m totally in favor of it. But we’re going to do what I just said. We’re going to pay for it, and it’ll help families, because a lot of families can’t use it. And a lot of these same families have been hurt so badly by their inflation. They cause the inflation. And we are going to pay for the IVF treatments, fertilization. They’re going to pay for it. We’re going to take care of it.
(45:07)
And another key driver of inflation is the migrant invasion Kamala Harris has created on our Southern border, which is causing immense inflationary pressure on housing and essential goods. There’s never been anything like coming into our country. Border Czar Harris, now she’s saying, “I was never named the border czar.” Yes, she was, but just say she was in charge of the border. We don’t have to call her a czar. She wasn’t really a czar. I think a czar is a compliment. Border Czar Harris will import millions more illegal aliens, and give them free housing and groceries.
(45:41)
And I will send the illegal aliens back home, where they belong. We have no choice. We have no choice. We cannot afford this. If they got in four years, you’d have over a hundred million people from all over the world. And remember this, crime rates are going down in all these countries, because they’re sending us their criminals. They’re sending us their drug dealers. They’re sending us their people that are in jails.
(46:05)
And I don’t have to go in a crazy way. That’s common sense. I would do the same thing. If I was running some nice country in South America or all over the world, the Congo in Africa, 22 people came out of jail recently. They sent them here. “Where do you come from?”
(46:19)
“Congo.”
(46:19)
“Oh, that’s nice. Where are you from in the Congo?”
(46:23)
“Jail.”
(46:23)
“Oh, what did you do?”
(46:27)
“We don’t want to say.” You can imagine. Let me just tell you, welcome. They’re your citizens. And they’re doing this all over the world. Tom Homan told me… Who’s great, by the way, he’s really great. Brandon, Jed, all these guys, Paul, all these guys, they’re incredible people. But the border patrol people are incredible. What they put up with from these incompetent lunatics that don’t even talk to them… They said, “We have, as of last week, this year, 169 countries represented by people coming illegally into our country.”
(47:04)
A hundred. Most people don’t even know you have that many countries. Some of those countries, we don’t even know the languages. A different language. We don’t have anybody in our country that even speaks it. But they’re pouring in. And many of them are the worst people in those countries.
(47:18)
And their crime rates are going way down. In Venezuela, their crime rate has plummeted, because they’re sending their killers. And if you saw that skit today, it was a skit. Well, I’ve seen it all. I guess I didn’t really think too much about it, other than how bad it is. In Venezuela, did you see the gang of Venezuelans today? They took over a building. They literally took over the building, walked in with machine guns, gang members from Venezuela.
(47:44)
You haven’t seen even the beginning of this migrant crime. We’re going to have a migrant crime. And just remember, they have a hat. It said, “Trump was right about everything.” And I have to say, I pretty much was right about everything. You are going to see, unfortunately. I wish I wasn’t. I wish I wasn’t. And be careful with World War III. I don’t want to be right about that, and I’m not going to say, but I will tell you, we’re close.
(48:11)
October 7th would’ve never happened, because Iran was broke with me. They had no money for Hezbollah. They had no money for Hamas. Russia would’ve never, ever attacked Ukraine. We would’ve had no inflation. You wouldn’t have had that horrible, embarrassing mess, that horrible, horrible mess in Afghanistan. So many things, this country would be a totally different country now. And I will end deadly sanctuary cities in the state of Michigan and all across the country. Nobody wants them. Nobody wants them.
(48:43)
So just in concluding, here is what we know about Comrade Kamala Harris: She just doesn’t care about the American people, especially hard-working people or middle-class Americans. She just doesn’t give a damn about you. She does not care about the deaths, sex slavery, drugs, or criminals coming across our border. She’s been vice president for almost four years, and she did nothing to stop the invasion of our country. She says that that’s not her job, but it is her job. The President of the United States gave her that job. She just didn’t do it, and she won’t do it now. She does not care about the middle class struggling over inflation, the cost of gasoline, electricity, and she doesn’t care about the cost of food. She does not care if you lose your job, or cannot find another comparable job. She doesn’t care. She does not care if you have to run up your credit card to levels that are unsustainable. She does not care if you and your family are struggling. And she did absolutely nothing to fix it.
(50:02)
She’s the vice president. She just does not care. She does not care about women’s rights, because she supported destroying women’s sports and athletic scholarships. She wants men to play in women’s sports. She’s one of the leaders, men should play in women’s sports.

Audience (50:20):

No.

Donald Trump (50:20):

She’s far further left than Bernie Sanders. Think of it. Nobody wanted Bernie Sanders to be president. She’s much further left than Bernie Sanders. Rated number one. She makes Pocahontas look like a conservative. Do you know who Pocahontas is? Yes, Elizabeth Warren. She said her mother said that she had high cheekbones, and therefore, she’s an Indian. No, I don’t think so.
(50:42)
Actually, that’s a very racist statement that she said, isn’t it? If I ever said that, that would be trouble. No, she said, “My mother said I was Indian because I had high cheekbones.” And then she put down on every application that she’s an Indian, she’s an Indian, getting jobs all over the place. But we knocked her out of the presidential race pretty good, too. That’s Pocahontas. They said, “We want you to apologize to Pocahontas for using that term.”
(51:12)
I said, “I will do that.” People were shocked, because I don’t give up too easy. And I did apologize to Pocahontas, the real Pocahontas. I said, “Pocahontas, I’m sorry I got you tied up with this person, this crazy person. Sorry, Pocahontas. I’m sorry, Pocahontas.”
(51:36)
But Elizabeth Warren is not nearly as radical left as this person, Kamala, but nobody knows Kamala because she doesn’t do anything. She does not care about protecting little children from sex change operations, because she chose Tampon Tim as her running mate, who believes the state, not mothers and fathers should have the final say on sex change operations for their children. Do you know that? The state’s allowed to decide whether or not they’re going to do a sex change operation on their children.

Audience (52:08):

Boo.

Donald Trump (52:10):

Kamala Harris wants to outlaw your car and truck, and force you to buy electric vehicles. Whether you like it or not, she couldn’t care less. And you can’t afford to do that, because again, they don’t go far, but they’re much more expensive. She does not care how it impacts you and your family. Kamala Harris does not care about senior citizens, because she believes illegal alien should receive Social Security and Medicare, which she knows will bankrupt those insurance programs, making it impossible for you to receive your pension and your healthcare, which you paid for your entire life, you’ve been paying for. People are going to take it away, those people that are coming in.
(52:50)
Remember, they’re living in luxury hotels, and our veterans are dying on the street. You know that. They’re dying on the streets under the hotels. You have pictures last night, veterans dying on the street, and other citizens, but veterans dying on the street. And inside the hotel, nice and high in nice rooms. Government’s paying a fortune to keep illegal aliens that came into our country, many of them criminals. There’s something wrong with the thought process.
(53:18)
She wants to destroy your private healthcare, even if you like it, even if your employer contributes to it. And she wants Washington, DC to make your medical decisions. She wants Washington to decide what procedures, medicines, and care you should receive. Whether you like it or whether you don’t, she doesn’t care. Kamala Harris has had nearly four years to show us who she is. She is an uncaring politician with a radical ideology. She is a Marxist, just like her father. Despite her campaign of lies and flip-flops, we know who Kamala Harris is. She’s the greatest flip-flopper of all time.

Donald Trump (54:00):

She’s copying every policy of Trump. Well, let’s make her MAGA, I don’t think so. Does anybody want to make Kamala MAGA? I don’t think so. We’ll send her a red hat without MAGA on it. We know by her actions and we know by her inaction, we know she does not care about working people, about the middle class, about the American citizen. She does not respect you. Ask the families of the 13 incredible service member heroes who died during the surrender of Afghanistan, which was surrendered by Kamala and Sleepy Joe, whether or not Kamala Harris cares about our young people and our military, those incredible parents and sisters and brothers.
(54:50)
They asked me to go yesterday to Arlington, and I did. And while I was there, I was there for a long time. It was very tough to get to because I was not in a good position to get there. It was very far away, but I did. And I got there right on time, and I spent a lot of time there. And while I was there, those families had asked me to be there, as they said. Three families plus one soldier who was horrifically injured, both legs and an arm. And they asked me if I would be there, so I went.
(55:20)
And while we were there, they said, “Could you take pictures over the grave of my son, my sister, my brother? Would you take pictures with us, sir?” I said, “Absolutely.” I did. And then I said farewell, I said goodbye. And last night I read that I was using the site to politic, that I used it to politic. This all comes out of Washington, just like all of these prosecutors come out of Washington. They all come out, they send their prosecutors into the DA’s office. They send them into the Attorney general’s office. These are bad people we’re dealing with.
(55:58)
So I go there, they ask me to have a picture, and they say I was campaigning. The one thing I get is plenty of publicity, I don’t need that. I don’t need the publicity. But these are great people. And when you think about it, Joe Biden killed their children by incompetence. It should have never happened. Kamala killed their children, just as though they had a gun in their hand, by gross incompetence. And not one general or incompetent bureaucrat was fired for the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, and then they accused me of having a picture taken at the tombstone with a family because they loved the president. They love me and I love them. I got to know them.
(56:50)
Ask the cops in the street trying to protect you from murderers and rapists and thugs if Kamala Harris cares about law abiding citizens, remember to fund the police. Ask the families of women raped and murdered by illegal aliens and the teenagers cut to shreds by gangs from El Salvador and Venezuela if Kamala Harris cares about you. She destroyed San Francisco. Harris has opposed school choice for poor inner-city kids. She has opposed police in schools to protect our children. She has defended stocking school library shelves with filthy graphic books, horrible books. She refused to prosecute pedophiles who molested children when she was DA and AG in California. Does this sound like someone who cares about your children?
(57:41)
Kamala Harris has failed you. She has failed totally as vice president of the United States. She’s been a total failure. Nobody even knows who she is. She’s broken trust with you. She’s done nothing for the middle class, nothing for working families, and she’s done absolutely nothing for hard working people. Your eyes don’t lie. You see it. You know it. We all see it. She’s the sitting vice president of the United States, and yet nobody knows who the hell she is. She does not give a damn about you. This is the real Kamala Harris, and now she wants to get a promotion. Did the worst job.
(58:24)
All she had to do is take care of the border, that would be okay. Just take care of the border, she couldn’t even do that. She never even went there. She went to a location that you’d like to go to to have dinner with your family. She never even went to the border effectively, think of it. Never spoke to anybody. All of those great border agents, did you ever speak to her? No, nobody ever spoke to her. Well, I’m here to not give her a promotion, I’m here to give her a demotion. Because she can hide. She can lie through her surrogates and the corrupt media, and they are very corrupt, remember that. But the truth is coming out, and it will come out. The American people are smart. They are not to be manipulated by Hollywood, the fake news media and advertising. And as you deserve a president who respects you, talks to you, and who levels with you, puts it right on the level, and who always has your best interests and has your back. I have your back, I have your heart, and I have every other part of your body. All of us today are part of the greatest political movement in the history of our country. This is the greatest movement in the history of our country. We did something, we really broke them up. This was getting bad, we broke them up. They’re not happy about it, they’re nasty. But this is the greatest MAGA, make America great again, the greatest movement in the history of our country. Outside, they won’t ever report that, they don’t ever report it. Outside you have thousands and thousands of people that couldn’t get in, they don’t get seats like you guys. They didn’t get the seats that you got, believe me. But you have thousands and thousands of people outside, as far as the eye could see, as we’re driving up. With your vote, we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates, and low inflation so that everyone can afford groceries, a car, and a home.
(01:00:22)
We will stop immediately the horrific invasion and migrant crime, support our police, build a missile defense shield all around our country like other countries have. We make them here, it’ll all be made right here, and it’ll be made also in Michigan, a lot of it. And Ronald Reagan wanted that many years ago, but the truth is, at that point we didn’t have the technology. Now we have great technology. You see that other countries have it, we don’t have it. We’re going to have the best of all. We’re going to have a missile defense system, going to be built in the United States, installed all over and around our country. We’re going to restore peace through strength, which is what I did. We had no wars when Donald Trump was president. Now we have nothing but wars.
(01:01:13)
Prime Minister, Viktor Orban of Hungary, he said, “The reason that the world is a mess, because Trump is no longer president. When Trump was president, they were afraid of Trump.” I don’t want to use that term, but he did. He said, “They were afraid. China was afraid. Putin was afraid.” I stopped Putin’s pipeline in Europe. I’m sorry, Vladimir. I can’t let you do it. I stopped it. It was stopped cold. And then when Biden got in, the first day he approved it. Then they said, “Trump was weak on Russia.” Putin said, “If you’re weak on us, I’d hate like hell to see if you’re strong on us.” But the war would’ve never happened, it would’ve never ever happened. But Viktor Orban said, “You bring back Trump and the whole world is going to be a safer place.” We’re going to keep critical race theory and transgender insanity out of our schools. We’re going to keep men out of women’s sports and we’re going to return our society based on merit, which the Supreme Court has given us the right to do, based on merit. We’re going to go back to a merit system. If you’re good at something, that’s what you get. The Supreme Court approved that. That was courageous. We will defend the Second Amendment, we’re going to do something that I think is very important, we’re going to restore free speech. And we will really, truly restore. We’re going to fix our elections so that our elections are going to be honorable and honest, and people leave and they know their vote is counted.
(01:02:48)
We are going to have free and fair elections. And ideally we go to paper ballots, same-day voting, proof of citizenship, very big, and voter ID. Very simple, very simple. One day voting, one day. You ever see these things? Everyone’s talking about November 5th, but forget November 5th, it starts on September 6th in various states, North Carolina, but various states. Delaware, it starts on November 6th, goes months and months, voting. Why are those boxes being moved around? Why are those ballots being moved? Why are they not there? “Sir, we’re fixing the air conditioning of that particular…” It is so bad. It is so out of control. Everyone under President Trump will prosper, every family will thrive, and Michigan manufacturing will dominate like never before. You’re going to dominate like never before.
(01:03:46)
But for that to happen this election day, you must tell Comrade Kamala, “Comrade, you’re doing a horrible job. You’ve been a terrible vice president, a horrible, horrible border czar. You’re not a border czar, you’re a border patsy.” You were played by every country in the world. The worst job we’ve ever seen, probably the worst vice president we’ve ever had. He certainly was the worst President. Comrade Kamala, you are fired. Get out of here. You’re fired. Get out of here. Get out of here.
(01:04:26)
It’s amazing they can have support, I don’t get it. Who would support somebody that wants open borders? Who would support somebody that wants men in women’s sports? You see the boxing in the Olympics, two transitioned people, they transitioned from men to women, did you see? Fighting, a young, beautiful Italian boxer, top boxer, they thought big things from her. And then bing. A left jab, just a jab. She go, “Whoa, what? I just got hit with a horse.” Again, bing. She said, “I’m out.” She quit. She couldn’t take it. Two punches.
(01:05:03)
The second one likewise got into the ring with a couple of very talented women, just beat the hell out of them. They both won the gold medal, shockingly. Are you shocked? You’re not shocked. In fact, you would’ve bet everything. You would’ve bet 100%. The odds were pretty good. And then you have people like Kamala. How about weightlifting? Weightlifting record set many years ago, they’d put one eighth of an ounce on each side. Eighteen-year-old record. They go out there. They’re strong women, they can’t quite make it though. Guy comes out, “Have you lifted before?” “No, no. How do I do it?” “Just put your hands on the bar, try and…” “You mean like this?”
(01:05:48)
The whole thing is crazy. And nobody wants to complain. The women, like the swimmers, they don’t like to complain. They’re really afraid to complain, because they’ll be accused of bad things, bad things. But look at the swimmers that come out there, Olympic swimmers. They look left, they look right. They see people that they were growing up with, great swimmers, and then they look over and they see this huge… It was Wilt Chamberlain but slightly bigger. And she says, “Well, look at the size of this person. I don’t recognize the person from California, from the California swim groups that I participated in for 10 years before I got to the Olympic trials.” And this person blew them away. In fact, it was very sad. They got passed so fast, the wind was so tremendous that she suffered wind burns. They had to take her out of the [inaudible 01:06:48].
(01:06:47)
No, we joke about very serious subjects. It’s so sad, but really what’s sad is that people that would want something like that. And it’s so demeaning to women, don’t you think, it’s so demeaning to women. We love women, that’s so demeaning to women. Never had anything like it, but you have to watch the fights. It just says it, it says it so simply. You watch these two fights, it was like they didn’t even have to do anything. Olympic gold, they won Olympic gold. They transitioned. So get your friends, get your family. Register, volunteer, and get out. And you got to vote. And Pete, you are doing a great job, by the way. I see you sitting there. You are doing a great job. Pete Hoekstra. I’m glad I remembered to introduce him. He would’ve quit just before the election. He’s doing it. We’re doing good, right? Yeah, he was a great congressman. He was the one we earmarked, right Mike? We wanted Pete. And I hear you doing a fantastic job, we appreciate it very much.
(01:07:52)
On November 5th, we will save our economy. We will rescue our middle class. We will put America first, and we will make America great again. We’re going to make America greater than ever before. We’re going to bring back your car industry. We’re not going to just keep it a little bit that you have left. You lost most of your industry. We’re going to bring back your car industry. We’re going to let them build plants, but they’re not building them in Mexico, they’re going to build them in the United States of America. And they’re going to be fired up by our auto workers. And we’re going to bring them back in numbers that nobody can believe, and I can do it so easily. We were all set to do it, and then we had the COVID disaster come in.
(01:08:31)
And we did a great job, never got the credit for the ventilators, the therapeutics that we did, the robes, everything. But what China did was very bad, very bad. But we’re going to bring it all back to this state. You’re going to have the greatest state in the world for auto-making. You’re coming back with auto-making, because that’s what you do and that’s what you do best. And a lot of these people, even if it’s just job related, auto worker related, this is what they want to do. And they want to be here, they don’t want to have to move. But you’re not going to have any place to move because other jobs are going to be gone too, they’re taking away all our jobs.
(01:09:09)
We’re not going to let it happen. We’re going to make America great. We’re going to make America the production capital, manufacturing capital of the world, and it’s going to happen very fast. I hope you’re going to go out and vote for me, because honestly, if you don’t, our country is finished. Thank you. God bless you. God bless America. Thank you everyone.","Potterville, Michigan","2024-09-03",5,7,0,4,2,0,2,1,1,0
"26",26,"Trump Speaks at Turning Point rally in Glendale, Arizona","https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-speaks-at-turning-point-rally-in-glendale-arizona","Kari Lake (00:01):

And I thought to myself, so is this what Frank Sinatra sang about in New York, New York? This was Trump Tower. This was New York City. If we could make it there, you can make it anywhere. Jeff and I were there. We were led into his office, and behind a large beautiful desk sat a larger-than-life Donald J. Trump. He welcomed us. He welcomed us, and immediately we launched into a recap, and he remembered a recap of a Turning Point event that we had both attended about a month earlier. And he talked about the huge, loud, incredible, warm applause that I had received when he called out my name from you, the people of Arizona. And he said to me, I’ll never forget it, he said, “Kari, that wasn’t a poll that you hire a pollster to do. That was a real poll. That was the people telling me who they support.”
(00:56)
And then he began asking a few questions, questions about how the campaign was going, polling, about policy. And I’ll be honest, I was able to answer all of them with no problem, except for one, a very important question that took Jeff and me completely off-guard. And my husband, I don’t know where he is. Are you out here, Jeff? Somewhere? Come here, hon. Say hi to Jeff please. Do you remember what the president asked us?

Jeff Halperin (01:43):

He asked us how long we’d been married.

Kari Lake (01:48):

That’s what stumped us. Jeff forgot. And to Jeff’s benefit, I also forgot. We turned to each other and we started counting and doing the math and we came up with the figure 23 years. So we’ll never get that wrong again, will we? I love you. I love this man. Thanks, hon. Three weeks ago, Jeff and I celebrated our 26th anniversary. It feels like the first year, doesn’t it? So let me get through this story. So what was supposed to be a 15-minute meeting had turned into an hour-long conversation with Donald Trump. At the end of it all, the president rose. He shook our hands. He told me he would support me and endorse me. It was the greatest birthday gift I’d ever received. Really great. Long story long, I spent my 52nd birthday in New York City with the greatest president. I’m spending my 55th birthday here in Glendale with all of you and the greatest president. And Arizona, I look forward to spending my 56th birthday in Washington D.C. with the greatest president representing you, the greatest people in the entire country.
(03:27)
Decades ago, like many of you, on my 18th birthday, I registered as a Republican, inspired by a man named President Ronald Reagan, whose very powerful words still guide us. I think one of his most famous speeches, he said, “You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We’ll preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we’ll sentence them to take the last step into a thousand years of darkness.” That speech was called A Time For Choosing, and that’s exactly where we stand at this moment. We’re at a crossroads and we have choice right now. We either save this country and our best days are ahead of us, or we plunge into a thousand years of darkness.
(04:17)
Guys, we’re going to save this country. Ronald Reagan spoke those words on behalf… Did you know this? He spoke those words on behalf of Arizona’s favorite son, Senator Barry Goldwater, a man whose senate seat I would be honored to fill. I really would. Back then, the media called him extreme. The media called Reagan extreme. They called Trump extreme. They call me extreme, and they call each and every one of you extreme. Yep, because we are onto their corrupt system. Can you imagine calling a middle-aged mom like me a far right extremist?

Speaker 3 (05:10):

We love it.

Kari Lake (05:15):

She said, “We love it.” You know what? So far I have been right about everything, and the only extreme thing about us and me is that I’m extremely worried about my children’s future. I am. I’m extremely worried about what my opponent, Ruben Gallego, will do to the state that we love. I’m running against the most radical man to ever run for office in Arizona history. Have you seen Ruben’s commercials? Honestly, they should come with a laugh track because they are an absolute joke. They really are. For a decade in Congress, this man was a card-carrying member of the Progressive Caucus, a man actually to the left of Bernie Sanders and to the left of The Squad. And now he’s bombarding our airwaves with ads meant to make him look like a cross between Mr. Rogers and G.I. Joe, when in reality he’s just Nancy Pelosi with a scruffy beard. Now, guys, if you don’t mind it, I’m about to lay out some hard truths about my opponent, Ruben Gallego. And I’m not telling you this to be mean. I’m really not. I’m telling you this because the people have got to know before they vote who this guy is. His ads leave out a whole lot of despicable treatment of women. His ads don’t tell you about the time that he harassed and threatened a 20-year-old female intern, and when she complained about it, she was fired. His ads don’t tell you about the fact that his fellow Democrats down at the state legislature gave him the nickname The Troll because of how creepy and degrading he was with women. And his ads don’t tell you about the time he told the Latina woman that because she was a Republican, she wasn’t a real Latina.
(07:35)
Can I hear it for our incredible conservative Latina women? We got a house full, including my daughter right down there. His ads don’t tell you frankly about the most unforgivable act against a woman, when he walked out on his pregnant wife when she was nine months pregnant. Days before she delivered their firstborn child, he served her papers and he ran off to sleep with a D.C. lobbyist. That’s despicable. I can promise you, if Ruben Gallego will abandon his family to jump in bed with a lobbyist, he will abandon Arizona in favor of D.C. lobbyists every single vote.
(08:38)
If his treatment of women isn’t enough to keep him out of the US Senate, then his voting record ought to be. I want to talk about his votes. He supports open borders. This is actually shocking. He told donors, when it comes to the border, it’s not his expertise. He called the border wall, which is keeping us safe in some areas, dumb and stupid. And he voted against the SAVE Act. That means he wants millions of illegals to vote in this upcoming November election. Bad idea, Ruben. He voted for sanctuary cities. He supports amnesty. He’s weak on law and order. I don’t even think he likes our police officers. He actually called them the bad guys. He did. The direct quote, in case the media wants to fact-check me, he said, “The bad guys are the ones behind the police line.” How dare you, Ruben. How dare you.
(09:48)
He marched at defund the police rallies, and then he threatened ICE agents. He’s weak on the economy. He voted for legislation that resulted in this 40-year-high inflation. That’s why we can’t afford anything. And when it came to the very short period of time that he worked in the private sector, he was a director for a bank that built immigrant families out of their life savings. At another company he worked for, under federal investigation during Ruben’s time for Medicare fraud… Guys, I’m telling you all this because the fake news media won’t cover him. Let me tell you, if I had one of those digs against me, they would be all over it, and they won’t cover him. If Ruben Gallego is willing to defraud Medicare, he’s willing to cut Medicare. He ripped off our seniors before he will do it again. I want you to know what it comes to Medicare and Social Security, our seniors paid into it and they lived up to their end of the deal. Uncle Sam needs to live up to his end of the deal. Let me be perfectly clear. When I’m in the US Senate, any politician that tries to lay a finger on your Medicare or your Social Security will have to go through me. And worse yet, they’re going to have to go through President Trump, and that guy’s bulletproof. Arizona, we’ve got to reject the dead-end Biden-Harris agenda that Ruben Gallego voted for a hundred percent of the time. We can’t take four more years of this. But the good news is we don’t have to take four more years of it. The problems we face are massive, but the solutions are so simple. America First policies. Strong economy, safe border, safe streets, energy dominance, record low inflation, mortgage rates, unemployment. When we win, we’re going to bring back that hot job market that President Trump introduced. Frankly, the only people I want to see out of a job are the human smugglers, the drug smugglers, the child traffickers, the cartels. And I’d like to see the propagandists in the media on the unemployment line.
(12:46)
Arizona, we deserve clean, safe, and secure neighborhoods. We deserve to be prosperous again and our children deserve a shot at the American dream. And I’m going to be a little bit selfish right now. I’m not a career politician. I’m a mother of two beautiful children. My son is 19. Let’s hear it for our boys, our strong young men. We need you guys. I’m worried about my son and daughter’s future and I’m worried about your future as well. I’m a fed-up mama bear who recognizes that President Trump is the only person who could lead us out of this nightmare and restore the American dream. And that’s why we elected him in 2016 and in 2020. Are you ready to elect him again in 2024? Arizona, vote Trump for president and Lake for US Senate. We know President Trump stands for American greatness. I will stand for Arizona greatness. So here’s my promise to you starting on day one. I will work with President Trump to secure the border and finish the wall.

Multiple speakers (14:21):

Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall.

Kari Lake (14:26):

That’s right. That’s right.

Multiple speakers (14:46):

Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall.

Kari Lake (14:46):

From the Gulf Coast all the way to the Pacific Ocean, 16 million people have poured across our border during the Biden invasion. In order to save our homeland, we got to send them back to their homeland. We will begin the largest repatriation operation this world has ever seen. We will define the drug cartels as foreign terrorists and we will use every ounce of energy our law enforcement and military has to put them out of business for good. That’s how we end human smuggling. That’s how we end child sex trafficking.
(15:46)
That is how we end the scourge of fentanyl. The number one cause of death right now for our young people is fentanyl poisoning. Too many sons and daughters and sisters and brothers and loved ones are being wiped out by these cheap, counterfeit, poisonous pills. 290,000 young people are gone under border czar Kamala Harris and Ruben Gallego. Gone. Under their reign of incompetence, we’ve lost a generation of young Americans. This is our future. This generation is our future and we want it to be strong. So my message to young voters, and they’re all over this place, I will be your biggest advocate in Washington D.C. I will do everything I can to help you guys start a family, own a home, and live the American dream.
(16:51)
I have one favor to ask you though. I want you guys, when you think of that American dream, to dream big. Really, really big, okay? Because the future is going to be bright. The future coming your way is going to be very, very bright. Now, a couple more promises. Before I vote on any legislation, first of all, I plan to read it, okay? And then I’m going to ask myself a few questions. Will this make Arizona safer, stronger, more affordable? Will it make our country more secure and prosperous? And is it constitutional? And if the answer is yes, yes, yes, yes and yes, then I’m going to vote yes for it. It’s pretty simple. I will support legislation that calls for the death penalty for any criminal who kills a police officer in the line of duty. And my message to law enforcement, any of you in this crowd, let me hear from you if you’re in this crowd and your law enforcement. And their families. Any family of law enforcement here?
(18:20)
I’ve got your back, because you always have our back. I’ve got your back. And that’s why the law enforcement unions around this state have endorsed me. I got a message to moms and dads. This is one’s really near to my heart. I will crack down on any school pushing gender insanity on our precious children. We’re done. We’re done. We’re done. God did not put our kids in the wrong body. The people pushing this sickness are in the wrong job. I will support education that focuses on teaching the fundamentals, along with skills training so our kids are ready for the jobs right out of high school. And I will help save girls’ sports and save women’s athletic scholarships. Girl power. Democrats always say trust the science. Well, I do, and the science shows there’s only two genders.
(19:52)
Okay. Finally, we’re going to address the water issue in Arizona and the American Southwest. We’re going to identify new sources of water and explore desalination options, including piping fresh water into the West. And we’re going to make California do more to collect water runoff and snow melt. Arizona’s tired of being punished for California’s recklessness. We need a return to common-sense America First policies. We’re going to take our first step toward that when we vote in Arizona. Ballots hit mailboxes October 9th. Yes, we have voting season here. And election day is November 5th, and we all have a part in saving America. Vote early if you want. Sign up to be a poll worker and a poll observer. Go to tpaction.com/100 and sign up to be a ballot chaser. Can you do that, guys? And if you know somebody who lives outside of Arizona who wants to come and help our state, Turning Point Action will pay for their hotel for the month of October so they can come in and chase ballots. Invite your friends in.
(21:23)
We all have got to get involved. No one is too young. No one is too old. Charlie said it. By the way, is Charlie Kirk great? He’s amazing. Charlie said it. We welcome all Republicans. All Republicans. Independents and disaffected Democrats too. This movement, it’s called America First. We’re not just Republicans first. We welcome everybody. This is about bringing America together. Our founding father, Benjamin Franklin, was 81 years old when he said, “We have a republic if you can keep it.” We are in the “if you can keep it” part. And at 43 years old, John F. Kennedy famously said, “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.” We got to step it up and save our country right now.
(22:25)
As one of the greatest leaders in humankind who’s about to take the stage always says, let’s make America great again. We will do it. Arizona, vote Donald J. Trump for president, vote Kari Lake for US Senate, and vote Republican up and down that ballot. And when you do, we will make Arizona great again. We will make America great again. I love you all. God bless you. God bless President Trump. And God bless state 48.

He brought manufacturing back to America. Small businesses flourished. He did what he promised. He put America first.

And I won’t forget the men who died who gave that right to me.
(27:00)
And I’d gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today.

Because there ain’t no doubt I love this land. God bless the U.S.A.

Where’s pride in every American heart, and it’s time we stand and say.
(27:54)
That I’m proud to be an American where at least I know I’m free.
(27:54)
And I won’t forget the men who died who gave that right to me.

Donald Trump (29:39):

Well, thank you very much and a very big hello, Arizona. Hello, Phoenix. I’m thrilled to be back in this incredible state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. That’s what you are. You built our country. 74 days from now, can you imagine? 74 days. Then we gently move into that beautiful White House and we take over our country and we make it great again. We’re going to win Arizona. We’re going to defeat comrade Kamala Harris, and we’re going to win back our beautiful White House. We’re going to win it back. We’re going to win it back in record force. Everyone here tonight is part of the greatest political movement in the history of our country. This is the greatest political movement. It’s called Make America Great Again. And it’s right now bigger and better and stronger than it ever was before. We won in 2016, and we did much better in 2020.

Donald Trump (31:00):

A lot of people don’t understand that, but we understand it. Millions and millions more votes, but those two are nothing like the spirit that we have now. It’s amazing, and that’s because we’ve seen how bad government can be. That’s why. It’s combinations of a lot of things, but the job they’ve done in destroying our country is unbelievable and people have seen it and because of that, there’s never been anything like this. Right, Carrie? Right? Our movement is not about Democrat versus Republican. It’s about patriotism and common sense. You have a common sense with a Party of common sense. You say what you want, nice to say conservative, but really, with a Party of common sense. We want fair elections, free elections. We want strong borders. We want a great military. We want great education. We want a nice home at low interest rates or low taxes and no regulations.
(31:58)
That’s why we’re welcoming support from millions and millions of disaffected Democrats and they are joining like wildfire. Now, it’s a little different than it was. We had somebody, I was up 18 points and they said, “Joe, you can’t win. You’re getting out of the race.” “No, I want to go and give it a shot.” “No, Joe. You’re getting out of the race, Joe, and if you don’t do it the nice way, we’ll do it the tough way, Joe.” And he said, “Okay.” And now I have a new opponent. This never happened before. We spent $100 million and a lot of time on defeating him, and as soon as he was gonzo… It all started with the debate. The debate, all that time, all that effort. A friend of mine said, “You did a terrible job in the debate.” I said, “Why do you say that? Everybody said I was brilliant.” They said, “No, you got him out of the race with that debate.”
(32:57)
It’s all right. We have to do what we have to do. Right? We have to do what we have to do, and now we have somebody that in theory should be easier to beat, in theory because she’s a radical left Marxist and everybody knows it, but we’re welcoming the support from millions of disaffected Democrats, independents, moderates, old-fashioned liberals who still believe in little things like borders. I was there yesterday. That’s a scary place. ” Sir, it’s about time that you get out of the sun. Sir, we’re going to have to get you out of here, sir. Let’s get the hell out of here.” She was the border czar. She presided over the worst border in history, not American history, world history, democracy, liberty, and of course, always the right of free speech. We don’t really have free speech right now. The press, look at all of them. Look at all of them. Look at that. Wow. Man. That’s a lot of press. That’s a lot of fake news. That’s a hell of a lot of fake news.
(34:09)
Gone forever is the old Democratic Party of FDR, JFK. That’s right, even Bill Clinton. Kamala Harris’ Democrat Party is the Party of free healthcare for illegal aliens, communist-style price controls, defund the police. All her life, she wants to defund the police. A little while ago she changed, didn’t she? Huh? Banning gas-powered cars and sex changes for minor children without parental consent. How about that one? How would you like that? Without parental consent. Can you imagine, your kid comes home without parental consent? “What happened to my baby? What happened?” The true divide in American politics today is between these far-left fascists, led by Harris and her group, and you know who her group is, and citizens of all political backgrounds who love our country, share traditional American values, the values that you have right here in this great state, and look past our differences to unite around a thing called our great American flag.
(35:25)
And we should speak to our great Congressmen and Congresswomen. They ought to make it illegal to burn the American flag. If you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. That’s all. One year. You burn the American flag because in Chicago at the Democrat [inaudible 00:35:52], they were burning flags all over the place. You burn the American flag, they say it’s unconstitutional to do that. I think it’s constitutional. You burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. Nobody’s going to be burning the American flag anymore.
(36:10)
Our opponents worship the deep state. We want to obliterate the deep state, slight difference. Thank you. Our opponents join with warmongers and neocons to wage endless wars, these wars that never end. We don’t even know who the hell the country is that we’re fighting. We believe that America is strongest when America is at peace. We want peace through strength. That’s what we want, like we had four years ago. We didn’t have any wars, except we wiped out ISIS very quickly. It was supposed to take five years to beat ISIS. I did it in three weeks.
(36:56)
They support coercive COVID vaccine mandates and want to fire you. If you don’t obey, you get fired. We oppose these mandates as a fundamental violation of our God-given rights. We don’t want the mandates. We don’t want the mandates. They want to arrest their political opponents and silence those who disagree. We reject censorship in all forms and we believe in freedom, open debate and fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law. Our opponents slander us as a threat to democracy. “Trump is a threat to democracy.” No, they’re a threat to democracy. How many times have you heard? It’s a talking point for them. Right, Deb? It’s a talking point. “Donald Trump is a threat to democracy.” And those guys say it too because they’re the same thing. They’re like a part. They’re a subsidiary of the Democrat Party.
(37:59)
Meanwhile, they rig their primaries, they force out Joe Biden, they force him out of the Party. Joe Biden got 14,000,000 votes in an unconstitutional coup, and they appoint a nominee who never got a single vote. And when she ran against this guy, and I’m no fan, he was the worst president in the history of our country. He let in millions and millions of people through her, let in millions of people who destroy our country, but we’re going to get those people out. The people that came in here from jails and prisons and mental institutions, but they threw them out. They ran against each other for the primary and she never even made it to the first state. The great State of Iowa, never made it. And now she’s the one running. A little strange, isn’t it? You see, that’s really a threat to democracy if you get right down to it, right? In our movement, we know that democracy does not mean rule by the Democrat establishment. It means rule by the American people.
(39:09)
Tonight, I’m very pleased to welcome a man who has been an incredible champion for so many of these values that we all share, and we’ve shared them for a long time. I don’t think too many of you people have heard of him. He’s very low-key. He’s a very low-key person, but he’s highly respected. He is a great person. I’ve known him for so long, for the past 16 months. Robert F. Kennedy Jr…

MUSIC (39:40):

There goes my hero. Watch him as he goes. There goes my hero. He’s ordinary. There goes my hero. Watch him as he…

Donald Trump (39:40):

Man, whoa. And he deserves it. He deserves it.

Audience (39:41):

USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA…

Donald Trump (39:41):

For the past 16 months, Bobby has run an extraordinary campaign for President of the United States. I know because he also went after me a couple of times. I didn’t like it, and I mean this sincerely. Had he been allowed to enter the Democrat primary, he would’ve easily beaten Joe Biden, but they wouldn’t let him in. They put up rules. I’ve never seen rules like he had to have 65% of the vote in order to run. Little things like that. His candidacy has inspired millions and millions of Americans, raised critical issues that have been too long ignored in this country, and brought together people from across the political spectrum in a positive campaign, grounded in the American values of his father, Robert Kennedy, a great man, and his uncle, President John F. Kennedy.
(41:50)
And I know that they are looking down right now, and they are very, very proud of Bobby. I’m proud of Bobby. You want to know the truth? And I don’t think I’ve ever introduced anyone that got applause like he just got. I must tell you, it’s true. I don’t think I’ve ever introduced anybody that got applause like that.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (42:19):

Amazing.

Donald Trump (42:19):

Amazing. Still.

Audience (42:19):

Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!

Donald Trump (42:47):

Amazing. Soon after I was, I can’t even believe I have to say this, nearly assassinated in Pennsylvania last month, Bobby called me to express his best wishes. He knows firsthand the risks incurred by leaders who stand up to the corrupt political establishment. When you stand up, you bring on some trouble for yourself, but you have to do what’s right. You have to do what’s right for the country. I will tell you, we are both in this to do what’s right for the country. That’s one thing I can tell you. He lost his father and uncle in service to our country, and Bobby himself was subject to repeated threats to his safety during the course of his campaign while being denied protection by the Harris-Biden administration.
(43:41)
And this is a tribute in honor of Bobby. I am announcing tonight that upon my election, I will establish a new independent Presidential Commission on Assassination Attempts, and they will be tasked with releasing all of the remaining documents pertaining to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. And they will also conduct a rigorous review of the attack last month. But I tell you, I have never had more people ask me, “Please sir, release the documents on the Kennedy assassination,” and we’re going to do that.
(44:39)
I also want to salute Bobby’s decades of work as an advocate for the health of our families and our children. Nobody’s done more. Millions and millions of Americans who want clean air, clean water and a healthy nation have concerns about toxins in our environment and pesticides in our food. That’s why today I’m repeating my pledge to establish a panel, top experts working with Bobby to investigate what is causing the decades-long increase in chronic health problems and childhood diseases, including autoimmune disorders, autism, obesity, infertility, and many more. We want every child in America to grow up and to live a long and healthy life.
(45:35)
So I just want to ask Bobby to speak for a little while. I’ll stand aside. I’m going to stand aside, but I can only tell you I’ve known him a long time. We’ve been a little bit on the opposite side of the equation, but I will say this, he is a brilliant… I still think of him as young. He’s not that young. I always call him young, but he’s not that young. But he is a phenomenal person, a phenomenal man who loves the people of this country as much as anybody can love the people of this country. So Bobby, please say a few words. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (46:28):

Thank you. Thank you, President Trump.

Audience (46:42):

Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (46:42):

Thank you. A few hours after the assassination attempt at Butler, I got a call from a safe food advocate named Kelly Means, who’s been fighting for many years to try to end the corruption at CDC and FDA and USDA. And these institutions, these regulatory agencies are actually run by the big food processing companies, the big ag and the chemical companies, yet they’re supposed to regulate. And he said to me that he’d been advising me for many years and on my campaign, and he told me that night that he was also advising President Trump. And he asked if I would talk to President Trump? And I said, “Of course.” And about a few minutes later, I got a call from the president and we talked. We had a very good talk. And then he invited me to come see him the next day. And I went to Minneapolis and saw him. We met again a couple of weeks later in Florida and we talked not about the things that separate us because we don’t agree on everything, but on the values and the issues that bind us together. And one of the issues that he talked about was having safe food and ending the chronic disease epidemic. Our children are now the unhealthiest, sickest children in the world. Don’t you want healthy children? And don’t you want the chemicals out of our food? And don’t you want the regulatory agencies to be free from corporate corruption? And that’s what President Trump told me that he wanted. He also told me that he wanted to end the grip of the neocons on US foreign policy. He said he didn’t want any more $200-billion wars in Ukraine that we could use that money back here in the United States. And the best way to build a safe America is to rebuild our industrial base and rebuild the middle class in this country. And don’t you want a president who’s going to get us out of the wars and who’s going to rebuild the middle class in this country? And he told me that he wanted to end the censorship because the whole basis of American democracy is the free flow of information, and we know that a government that can silence its opponents has license for any kind of atrocity. And can you think of any time that you can look back in history and say that the people who were censoring were the good guys? They’re always the bad guys because it’s always the first step down that slippery slope to totalitarianism. And don’t you want a president who’s going to protect America’s freedoms and who is going to protect us against totalitarianism? And I want to ask you again, don’t you want a safe environment for your children? Don’t you want to know that the food that you’re feeding them is not filled with chemicals that are going to give them cancer and chronic disease? And don’t you want a president that’s going to make America healthy again? Thank you all very, very much, and God bless you, and God bless America.

Audience (52:09):

USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA!

Donald Trump (52:33):

Wow, that was something, huh? That was something. Fantastic guy. He did well, and the polls are good and all, but you have to remember, we have sort of like a two party system. It was designed that way and it’s awfully tough. And as well as he did, he’d be at 10 and 15 and 16 points sometimes. That’s a lot. That’s a lot. But if he were in a regular system like as a Democrat or perhaps as a Republican, but not against me, of course, but if he were in a regular system, there are a lot of people that maybe liked him the best, but they said, “We can’t vote.” So with all of those votes he was getting, he has a lot of votes that he could have gotten, I think he’s going to have a huge influence. We’re leading now, but I think he’s going to have a huge influence on this campaign. Actually, much bigger than you’d see in the polls, and those numbers are big to start off with. But Bobby and I will fight together to defeat the corrupt political establishment and return control of this country to the people.
(53:48)
And to all who supported Bobby’s campaign, I very simply ask you, join us in building this coalition. It’s a beautiful coalition in defense of liberty and safety, prosperity and peace. It’s going to be an incredible coalition and the relationship has been so good for so long. I have no doubt it’s going to work and work well, but we have to win. We have to take our country away from these people that are going to destroy our country. We won’t have a country left. So thank you very much. We need your vote.
(54:24)
As you all know, this week, the Democrats held their Convention. You probably saw at their Party. The media says the big message from their Convention was that we need to turn the page from the failures of the last four years. Do you believe it? They forgot they’ve run it for the last four years. She was saying last night, “We will stop the abuse. We will stop the high taxes.” I said, “You could have done it three and a half years ago.” In fact, you could leave that nice auditorium that you’re in and go to the White House right now. You want to have a strong border? All you have to do is say to the incredible Border Patrol, ICE, law enforcement, “Close the border now.” You don’t need bills. I did it, and we had the best border in history.
(55:25)
Put up that chart. Put it up. That chart, I love that chart. I love that chart. Put it up. I love that chart. Not everybody realizes, but that chart is very meaningful, even beyond the numbers that are on the chart. It shows the least numbers of illegal immigrants pouring into our country. Again, prisons, from mental institutions, terrorists, where the bottom arrow is. But you know what? That chart is meaningful in many ways. Some people understand what I’m talking about. I love you, darling. I love you. I’m going to sleep with that chart tonight, Deb. I’m going to sleep with that chart.
(56:19)
But isn’t that a beautiful site? Look at that. Look at that arrow. And then look what happens when… That was my last week in office, and look what happens after I left. It’s like a rocket ship. Look at that. Isn’t that terrible? No vetting, no checking. We have no idea who they are. They just pour into our country by the millions and millions and millions. We need to turn the page of four years of calamity and failure. They have had calamity and failure, and say, Kamala, you’ve done a horrible job. You’ve been the worst vice president in the history of our country. Kamala, you’re fired. You’re fired. Get out. Get out. Get out, Kamala. She’s the only person ever to get a nomination of a Party without getting one vote. She didn’t get one vote.
(57:22)
Hey, maybe she’s smarter than we think. You could look at it that way. As vice president, Kamala cast the deciding votes causing the worst inflation in decades, costing the typical American household, $28,000. Think of this. Higher prices. It was inflation, $28,000. As borders are, she flooded America with savage, illegal alien criminals who have been raping, pillaging and killing our cities and our towns. Three years ago this week, she was the final vote on the catastrophic Afghanistan withdrawal. And we were withdrawing, but we were going to withdraw with dignity, with grace and with strength. We would’ve been out faster, but we were going to keep [inaudible 00:58:15]. But that was the most embarrassing event in the history of our country, leading to horrific war and humiliation all over the world. When Putin saw that, he invaded Ukraine. It brought a lot of people back because they said, “The United States is run by incompetent people. The United States is no longer respected. It’s no longer strong.” That’s what they said.
(58:40)
A lot of these things that you’re seeing now wouldn’t have happened except for the horrible, horrible event of Afghanistan. I was dealing with the leader of Afghanistan, Abdul, and I said, “Abdul, you can’t kill our people.” He was killing our people. And I had a strong talk with him. I’m not going to get into it exactly. We went 18 months without one soldier being sniped at or shot at, not one soldier injured or killed. And then we had a tremendous election where we did probably 10,000,000 or 12,000,000 more votes that we got the first time. Most presidents don’t get as many votes the second time because people get bored, but they don’t get bored with me. They get bored. No, they get bored.
(59:37)
Like Barack Hussein Obama got far fewer votes the second time, and he won, he won. Have you heard of him? Barack Hussein Obama. Remember Rush? Rush Limbaugh, “Barack Hussein Obama.” He was nasty to me. He was nasty. Michelle was nasty. They’re all nasty, nasty people. They were very nasty. I was surprised. And I was sort of nice to him. I said, “No, I like him.” Good. It didn’t matter. They were nasty to me. And of course, last night, Kamala mentioned my name, I think 21 times. She didn’t mention the border. She didn’t mention inflation. She didn’t mention anything but my name over and over and over again. She blamed me for the border. I haven’t been there in four years. You saw it. I had the safest border, the best border we’ve ever had. She blamed me for the border. They lied so much. They lied about everything. She said, I was involved with something called Project 25. I don’t even know what the hell it is. No, they really were nasty. And then they say to me, “Sir, please stick to policy. Don’t stick to personality. You should be nice to people, sir. You have to be nice.” I call them up. My geniuses, they get paid a fortune. Actually, not that much, but I call up my people and say, “They’re knocking the hell out of me and you say I shouldn’t get personal. I have to get personal, don’t I?” I have to get personal. I have to get personal. They get personal, but I’m going to do my best. So they’re allowed to get personal with me, but I’m not allowed to get personal to them. They call me names that are so bad. Our great First Lady says, “But you’re not that way, darling.” They love our great First Lady, I will tell you. They do, they do. “But

Donald Trump (01:02:01):

But darling, you’re not that way. I said, “I know that,” and if I say something just slightly out of order, like, “She didn’t do a very good job last night,” please never, ever mention her look or anything like that. If you ever say, “She didn’t look really great,” that’s the end of your political career. So I wouldn’t say a thing like that.
(01:02:24)
How about her opening where she said, “Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.” I said, “What the hell is wrong with her, Deb?” Debbie Lesko. She’s a winner.
(01:02:42)
Is that Sheriff Joe? Oh. That’s Sheriff Joe. Look at that. A legend. And our Sheriff Joe’s looking at these clowns where they have no idea what they’re doing, where people come in by the millions. He had nobody come in. Remember, he dressed everybody in pink? Remember that, right? Is that right, Joe? They had to dress in pink. I mean, it wasn’t the worst. It wasn’t bad. I mean, you got a lot of killers that had to dress… Pink underwear, pink undershirt, and a pink outfit because he didn’t want them coming into our own country.
(01:03:51)
Do you remember Arizona when Sheriff Joe was at the border? You didn’t have people coming in. I think for the one year he had one person come in, but they got him. Now we have 3 million people coming in through your border. Your border. Oh, through the whole thing. It’s ridiculous. It’s not… Joe, it’s an honor. And I’ll tell you, people didn’t treat you right. You are a legend and you did a job like nobody else. It’s true.

Audience (01:04:29):

Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe.

Donald Trump (01:04:39):

Great going, Joe. And we love your wife. He lost his wife a few years ago and she was a hell of a woman, right, Joe? But she’s looking down at you and she’s proud of you. She’s saying, “You did very well with this group of people.” But I’ve known you for a long time. It was nobody like him. He understood the border better than anybody, and he ran it fairly. Very fair. But he ran it strong and they respected him. They didn’t even try. So thank you very much, Joe. Your wife is, she’s proud of you. She’s proud of you, very proud of you.
(01:05:14)
We’re grateful to be joined tonight by the founder of Turning Point Action, a gentleman named Charlie Kirk. Thank you, Charlie. What a job he does. I said, “Charlie, do me a favor. We got this thing won, but do me a favor: make sure they don’t cheat.” The only way they can do anything is if they cheat like hell and we’ve been victims of that. “Make sure they don’t cheat, Charlie. We don’t need the votes. We just want to make sure that they don’t cheat.”
(01:05:49)
Hello, Sheriff. How are we doing? How are you guys doing? Good, thank you. We need every sheriff to get over there, every law enforcement official, because we got the votes. We got to make sure everything’s on the up and up. Charlie and his team of people. I mean, he’s got hundreds of thousands of young people. It’s actually quite discriminatory.
(01:06:14)
Charlie, have you ever been sued by old people for not accepting them? He’s got the youngest looking group of people and their warriors. They’re unbelievable. The job Charlie has done is incredible. Thank you, Charlie. Thank you, Charlie. The job he’s done, it’s really incredible.
(01:06:36)
Also with us is an incredible congresswoman who has decided to go on to a certain board. Do you know what I’m talking about? The most important board maybe in the whole country, and she’s going to make sure everything’s on the up and up. Debbie Lesko. Debbie, thank you, Congresswoman. Thank you, Debbie. You make sure, Debbie. She just won a big election by a massive… Boy, you won that election easy. She won it pretty easy.
(01:07:07)
Another person who’s a friend of mine, he’s a warrior for a long time. He’s great. He loves his state, he loves our country. Andy Biggs. Congressman Andy Biggs, thank you. Thank you.
(01:07:25)
And two other warriors, a young one and a little bit older one, but boy, they are tough. You don’t get tougher than Eli Crane and Paul Gosar. Paul Gosar. Great. Thank you, Eli. Great, great. Beautiful. Great people.
(01:07:46)
And the next congressman from Arizona’s, eighth District Abe Hamadeh. Wow, it’s going to be good for a long time. He’s a young gentleman. Great Abe. Great job, great job. Great heart. He went through a tough one. Arizona GOP Chairwoman. She is doing a job. Gina Swoboda. Gina. She is doing a job.
(01:08:18)
And a very good friend of mine, the next senator from Arizona. I really believe this. Look, she’s running against… We don’t have to do a… I was going to bring her up. I was going to say, “Come on, Kari, speak,” but she just spoke for half an hour. What the hell am I going to do here?
(01:08:39)
But I will tell you, she’s running against a guy who’s a rubber stamp for, it used to be Biden. Now who the hell knows? I don’t even know. Do we know who it is? A rubber stamp for somebody.
(01:08:55)
But Ruben Gallego is horrible. He’s an open borders maniac. He’s a defund the police maniac. He shouldn’t be allowed to even run in this election against her, because Kari Lake is incredible. She’s incredible, she’s tough, she’s smart, she’s got heart, and she should be your next senator. I hope you win this sucker because you are winning.
(01:09:29)
You’re running against a guy that cannot carry your shoes. I’m being nice. You know the expression, “Can’t carry her shoes?” And you’re going to have a big victory, and we’re going to work together, and we’re going to make sure we win this state. I say this presidentially: if we win this state, which we’re expected to, we’re leading and all of that, we win the presidency and we have to take Kari Lake with us. Go get ’em. Go get ’em Kari. Go get ’em, Kari.

Audience (01:10:07):

USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.

Donald Trump (01:10:07):

Very important. And honestly, we all know Kari. She’s been a newscaster for 22 years. Everybody knows her. She’s never had a problem. She’s solid as a rock. This guy is a freaking loser. He’s a loser. So with that, we’ll go on. But good luck, Kari. We love you. Special.
(01:10:57)
Since Democrats didn’t talk about Kamala’s horrendous record last night, we will. For nearly four years, Comrade Kamala Harris… I use that term. I don’t know if it’s good. Is it good or not? Tell me. Let’s do a poll. Let’s do a poll. I love these free polls. Instead of spending $250,000 to a pollster that doesn’t even poll. You know what they do? They take your money. They say, “Let’s see, all right. 49 to 50.” It’s one of the greatest businesses in history.
(01:11:27)
I get a free poll here. Do you like the name? She’s a radical. Left lunatic, okay? She’s a defunder of the police. She wants to defund all the things that we talk about. Do I call her Comrade Kamala Harris or do I not? Ready? Ready? What do I do there? You tell me. You could tell me better than anybody. Okay, ready? I’ll say yes or no. Yes? No?
(01:12:11)
Comrade Kamala Harris has overseen a nation-wrecking border invasion. This is a nation-wrecking… It’s an invasion. One of the ways… I built hundreds of miles of wall, I was there yesterday. I looked up and down, I said, “Man, I built a lot of wall,” and we could have put up 200 miles more, but they didn’t want to do it. And that’s when I said, “You know, I think they really want to open borders,” but we built much more wall than I said I was going to build, and you couldn’t see the end of it yesterday. You couldn’t see the end. We had a news conference.
(01:12:51)
But it’s a dangerous area. It’s a dangerous area because of her. Because of him, but he put her in charge. Whether she’s borders or… And that’s what she was called. Only recently did she say she doesn’t have that.
(01:13:03)
But you know what? She has been the worst manager, and the border patrol never even… They never even met her. She’s in charge of it. They never even met her. And you suffered the price. She’s allowed at least 20 million illegal aliens into our country, including millions and millions of unvetted fighting-age men from 159 countries.
(01:13:29)
You know, it’s no longer just South America. They come from Africa, the Congo, a lot coming from jails in the Congo. Let me tell you, these people, the nice thing, they make our criminals look like the nicest people on Earth. That’s how tough they are.
(01:13:46)
They come from the Middle East. They come from areas that we’re fighting. They come from enemy terrain. They come from all over the world, and they do come from South America, but not only from South America. 159 different countries in the last year, and they’re totally unchecked and unvetted. Every single year she’s been in office, she has set an all-time high illegal border crossings record: triple and quadruple what the year before, where I’d have like 150,000 and she’d have two and a half million. What she has done to this country, nobody can tell you.
(01:14:26)
You know, she destroyed San Francisco as the district attorney. She destroyed California. You know that. This is a woman that’s going to take… She destroyed California. She had a policy: if you steal less than $950, you’re allowed to keep it. You could go. We’re not going to prosecute. So criminals are walking into stores. Mean, nasty guys, rough guys, and they take calculators and they calculate. ” Let’s say, I want to get up…” They walk out, then they walk back in. The whole thing.
(01:15:05)
This is who we’re going to have running our country? I don’t think so. And nobody lies like her. She’s a liar. She makes up crap. She’s the one going to raise… You know, she said, “Donald Trump is going to raise…” You know why she said I was going to raise? Because I’m going to put tariffs on other countries coming into our countries, and that has nothing to do with taxes to us.
(01:15:29)
That’s a tax on another country, and I did it with China and we had no inflation. I had no inflation. I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China, and not one other president took in 10 cents. They were all, “Oh, China. We’re afraid of China. We’re afraid of China.”
(01:15:49)
According to a new DHS report, Kamala Harris also lost, and this is impossible to believe, listen to this: 325, 000 migrant children are gone. They’re missing. She allowed them to be trafficked into our country. Many of these children are now in sex slavery or they’re dead. Probably mostly dead. They will never see their homes or their parents again. They were swiped out of their homes. They were taken out of their homes. This is a government number, 325,000 children: sex slaves or they’re dead. Many are dead.
(01:16:37)
Hamas has so little respect for Kamala and Joe Biden, crooked Joe Biden, that the hostages that they’re talking about all the time, I believe they’re largely gone. I believe they’re largely gone. So sad. When you look at what happened, when you look at that attack on October 7th, I believe they’re gone.
(01:16:58)
And the reason they’re not negotiating, it says, “Hamas has decided not to negotiate,” because what they want back are the hostages, and I think those hostages, for the most part, aren’t around anymore. And so they said, “Oh boy, we can’t really negotiate because we don’t have the hostages.” The hostages are largely gone. How sad. How terribly sad.
(01:17:22)
If they feared and respected Joe Biden and Kamala, they would never have killed those hostages. They would’ve never attacked. They would never have attacked when I was president. Iran was broke. Iran was broke. I told China, “If you spend any money on buying oil from Iran, you’ll never do business in the United States again, and we’re going to put a 200% tariff on Iran.” And Iran was broke and they had no money for Hamas and they had no money for Hezbollah.
(01:17:53)
You can check your numbers. Look at it. My last year, they had no money. We had no terrorism. For four years. I didn’t have any terrorism. Did you notice that? None. And when they asked Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, very strong guy, “What is the reason that things are so bad now?” The Middle East is blowing up. Russia is blowing up with Ukraine. There’s war starting all over the place. Looks like bad things could happen in Taiwan with China. What’s the reason? He says, “You got to get Donald Trump back as president. You won’t have any problems.” That’s what he said.
(01:18:30)
It’s true. It’s true. They respected your country. They respected your leader, but they respected our country. Now they laugh at our country. Our country has become a joke. She’s provided deportation immunity to the vast majority of criminal aliens living inside the United States, and is importing MS-13 gang members, known as the most violent gang of them all, into our cities and into our high school. Think of it: they’re coming into our high schools.
(01:19:04)
Kamala has set loose thousands of Venezuelan gang members who, according to law enforcement bulletins, have been given a license to shoot American police officers. You know that right? Under Harris, ICE deportations are at the lowest level in history, the history of our country. She supports deadly sanctuary cities.
(01:19:27)
Now, of course, she’s flip-flopping on everything. You do know that, right? You know that Joe? She’s flip-flopping on everything. Debbie, right? She’s a flip-flopper. Andy, she’s a flip-flopper. She flip-flops on everything, because she was polled. She said she didn’t do too well. That’s probably why she was the first out out of 22 people.
(01:19:48)
I can’t get over it. She was the first failure and now she’s running. Oh, we’re going to beat her. I look forward to the debate, too. I do look forward to the debate. I look forward to it.
(01:20:06)
She called for abolishing ICE. These are great patriots who are tough as hell. You need tough people. She’s compared ICE agents to the KKK. She wants to repeal the federal law that makes illegal immigration a crime, making illegal immigration totally legal. It’s okay to come into our country.

Audience (01:20:26):

Boo.

Donald Trump (01:20:27):

She wants to release all of the thousands of criminal illegal aliens that are locked up in detention centers, and these are the toughest of them all. She wants to release them into our country. We have detention centers for the toughest of them all. She says, “We’re going to release them.” Now, maybe they’ll ask her tonight, “Oh, no, I would never do that.”
(01:20:47)
She might change. She’s changing on everything. But don’t forget: if the election ever went haywire, if they can find a way to cheat enough and she wins, in quotes, “she wins,” she’s going to do everything that you wouldn’t dream of, including no fracking.
(01:21:04)
She didn’t discuss fracking last night. No fracking in Pennsylvania. I can’t imagine she could do well in Pennsylvania. 500,000 jobs are involved with fracking, and a huge amount of their budget. Everything’s involved with fracking and she’s against it.
(01:21:24)
In her speech last night, she lied about almost everything. She lied when she said I was going to raise taxes. No, I’m lowering taxes. She’s the one. She lied and said that, oh, this is the best, I’m going to be the one, and I was already there, I didn’t touch your Social Security and a lot of Democrats wanted me to. She lied when she said that I want to cut Social Security and Medicare. No, she wants to cut it because she wants to have the illegal immigrants coming into our country to go on Social Security and Medicare, which will destroy Social Security and Medicare.

Audience (01:22:04):

Boo.

Donald Trump (01:22:06):

It’s Kamala Harris who cast a tie breaking vote to cut Medicare by $266 billion. She cut your Medicare, remember this, by $266 billion, and then promised mass amnesty last night to 20 million illegal aliens and make them American citizens, which will absolutely obliterate your Social Security and your Medicare, ultimately leaving those programs bankrupt, and our seniors desperate and poor.
(01:22:45)
And remember, when you talk all of those hundreds of billions of dollars, you know what she’s putting that money into? The green new scam. She took it out of your Medicare. She’s putting it into one of the greatest ever, one of the great voices of sport, stand up. Let’s see if anybody knows who the hell you are.
(01:23:07)
Good job. A good man. He’s done a good job, but she took it out and she wants to put it into… She put it into the green new scam. She said the border was safe under her direction.
(01:23:19)
You know, they’re the party of disinformation and misinformation. They’ll say something 100 times “The border was safe.” Did you see her last night? “The border’s safe.” The first time she said that, it was about two months ago, and she went like this: “The border was… Safe.” She started choking. Horrible.
(01:23:46)
They are. They’re misinformation, disinformation. They lie. They keep saying the same untruth over and over again. And you’re not like in my business, you’re not in this political business like these people. You’re in other things. You’re lawyers and you’re carpenters and you’re electricians and you’re drivers, and you’re doing a lot of things.
(01:24:05)
By the way, no tax on tips. Remember that? No tax on tips. No tax on tips. She tried that one, and yet in Congress right now, they have bills to destroy people that don’t… Do you see what’s going on? It’ll never happen. It’s guaranteed to happen with me: no tax on tips.
(01:24:24)
But actually. It’s the most dangerous and unsafe border anywhere in the world. There’s never been a border like it. No country, ever. If a country had a border like that, they would fight with sticks and stones if they had to to keep the people out. She believes that if you say things enough over and over again, even if they’re stone-cold lies, like Project 25, “Project 25, he believes in…”
(01:24:51)
I don’t even know what the hell it is. I know it’s a group of people that got together and they’re slightly on the conservative side and it’s unbelievable what they do. It’s really unbelievable.
(01:25:04)
She would destroy our country. If she was ever elected, our country will go down the tubes. We’ll be in a depression like 1929. We will not have a country any longer.
(01:25:15)
Yesterday, I was at the border with the victims of Kamala’s migrant crime wave. One of them is here with us tonight. Michael Moran is the brother of Rachel Moran, who you know about. Rachel was a cherished 37-year-old mom of five absolutely incredible children, beautiful children, beautiful woman. Last summer, Rachel was out on a run when she was brutally raped and murdered by an illegal alien who was let into America by… Kamala Harris let her in. Said, “Let her in.”
(01:25:49)
The animal who committed this heinous crime first killed another woman in El Salvador before walking across the open border. Just walked right in. No problem. He then attacked a nine-year- old girl and her mother in a home invasion in Los Angeles before murdering Rachel in cold blood.
(01:26:07)
Michael, I promise you, in Rachel’s memory, we will stop this invasion and we will keep these savage criminals the hell out of our country. Thank you, Michael. Please. Thank you. So sorry, Michael. So sorry. Say hello to your parents and everybody. Okay? Thank you. So horrible. We are so sorry, Michael. Thank you for being here.
(01:26:34)
According to her own administration’s statistics on crime victims, Kamala Harris has presided over a 43% increase in violent crime, these are government numbers, by the way, including 58% increase in rape, 89% increase in aggravated assault, and 56% increase in robbery. During the riots of 2020, she encouraged her followers to donate to bail criminals, looters and arsonists and killers. People died. Including Shawn Michael Tillman, a dangerous repeat offender who went on to shoot and kill a Minnesota man six times in the head. He shot him six times in the head and torso, and Kamala let him out, let him go.
(01:27:22)
While Kamala Harris was DA of sanctuary city San Francisco, 20 years ago, maybe the greatest city in the world, today, it’s unlivable, she ignored the victims family: “Please, please let us do… Please don’t do this to us,” and refused to seek the death penalty against an illegal alien MS-13 gang member, one of the worst murderers they’ve seen in years, who murdered an innocent man and his two sons, and didn’t even remember he did it.
(01:27:57)
As California Attorney General, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon, and rape of an unconscious person as a non-violent crime.

Audience (01:28:12):

Boo.

Donald Trump (01:28:12):

Comrade Kamala Harris destroyed single-handedly, with some help from the worst governor in our nation, Gavin New-scum, both San Francisco and California itself. He’s a terrible governor. What a governor for years.
(01:28:33)
But you know, she might’ve picked a worse one. If you look at the numbers in Minnesota, we hope we’re going to win Minnesota. It hasn’t been once since 1972, Richard Nixon, but we’re doing well there, too, but the governor is horrible. You know what he did? He approved a bill to give tampons in every young man’s bathroom.

Audience (01:28:59):

Boo.

Donald Trump (01:28:59):

Right? Think of that. This is what we have. This is our vice president, our potential president: tampons in boys bathrooms. For years, Kamala Harris has pushed legislation to strip police officers of protection, trying to bankrupt them and ruin their lives for doing their jobs. No protection, no immunity, no nothing. She even endorsed Defund the Police.
(01:29:32)
I will never defund the police. I will only fund the police and fund them with plenty of money and pride. I will always back our law enforcement heroes in blue.
(01:29:46)
We are pleased to be joined tonight by the president of the Arizona Police Association, Justin Harris. Oh, no, he’s not a relation. Justin, are your relation? Last name is Harris, spelled the same. I’m very concerned about this. I’m not really. But Justin Harris is a great gentleman who has a special announcement. Justin, would you please come up? Thank you.
(01:30:22)
That’s an interesting… I’m not worried about it. Thank you. [inaudible 01:30:31].

Justin Harris (01:30:34):

Well, good evening everyone. I’m a little concerned about that illegal immigration chart you put up there. Was that a spike in immigration or the inflation?

Donald Trump (01:30:42):

Sort of both.

Justin Harris (01:30:42):

Kind of both, right? Wonderful job those Democrats are doing. My name’s Justin Harris. I’m a veteran police sergeant here in Arizona with 25 years of experience and service, and I also have the privilege and the honor to serve as the state president of the Arizona Police Officers Association.
(01:31:06)
The Arizona Police Officers Association is the largest law enforcement association in the state of Arizona, and we represent over 12,000 law enforcement professionals, the men and women that currently serve in our communities each and every day at the local, county, state, and federal law enforcement levels. We cover the entire state. And on behalf of the Arizona Police Association, we are proud to welcome President Trump to the great state of Arizona and to the wonderful city of Glendale, home of Luke Air Force Base.
(01:31:57)
Folks, these men and women in Luke fly those beautiful F-16 Fighting Falcons of the 309th Fighter Squadron and those beautiful, beautiful F-35 Lightnings. Nothing like hearing those jets flying overhead, which that’s the sound of freedom and American ingenuity.
(01:32:26)
Also, a special thank you to the Glendale Mayor, Jerry Weiers, and the entire city council for their unwavering support and advocacy for our police officers, active duty military, and our veterans. You’re not going to find stronger advocates for our military, our veterans, and our police officers anywhere in the world other than Glendale. Thank you, mayor and council.
(01:32:55)
Also, I wanted to give a special thank you to the men and women of the Glendale Police Department,

Justin Harris (01:33:00):

… the best and most professional police department in the country. That’s right. Thank you. With a special thanks to Police Chief Chris Briggs and the other eight West Valley Coalition departments that allowed us to use their law enforcement officers here today to keep us all safe, thank you, gentlemen and women. Law enforcement today is perhaps the most complex occupation on earth, it’s an honorable profession of service and commitment to others, those who step in the gap between good and evil and to protect our communities, and we do so knowing the risk. Officers are required to make split second decisions under the most uncontrolled, chaotic, and stressful situations, often at great risk to their own personal safety. Given the literally millions of contacts between officers and the communities, annually, with a few exceptions, officers make those decisions correctly as trained and in accordance with the law, but high profile does not mean high frequency. Currently, in this day and age of instant information, social media, and videos, there’s an unrealistic expectation of absolute perfection, it is not possible to be perfect every time because we hire from the human race.
(01:34:28)
People are not perfect. Good people can make mistakes. However, the constant orchestrated villainization of police officers has eroded the public’s trust, it has encouraged an air of obscenity, disrespect, and assault of attitudes and behavior towards police officers. What was that name we called her? What was that comrade Kamala, was that what it was?

Audience (01:34:50):

Comrade Kamala.

Justin Harris (01:34:55):

Kamala, Kamala, comrade… Well, what we do know is she supported defunding the police and the best term is they wanted to reimagine policing, I don’t know what that means. She is part of the radicalized movement to degrade public safety and make our communities less safe. In contrast, under President Trump’s first term in office, he always had our backs. Thank you for that. He never rushed to judgment, and he never, ever in a lifetime called to defund the police, ever.

Donald Trump (01:35:37):

[inaudible 01:35:41].

Justin Harris (01:35:43):

And we owe him a debt of gratitude for that. Let’s also forget when President Donald Trump was president, he closed the borders and locked the door. Borders are Kamala Harris opened the door and let everybody in.

Audience (01:36:04):

Boo.

Justin Harris (01:36:10):

Borders are Kamala Harris is allowing millions of illegal immigrants into this country, turning each and every state into a border state, and flooding American streets with drugs and crime. The Democrats haven’t quite figured this out yet, but it’s not rocket science, but open borders equals more crime, close the border. And my gut tells me that there’s a gentleman standing up here on stage today that’s going to do exactly that. President Donald Trump has in the past and will again make America great again by tackling lawlessness head on, ceasing the endless flow of illegal immigrants across our southern border, and ensuring the police departments across your country have the funding, the training, and equipment necessary to do our jobs. And he’s not going to reimagine us doing that. President Trump will stop the multi-million dollar illicit trade that occurs each and every day at the border. Thanks to comrade Kamala with these open borders the only group that she’s enriched is the Mexican cartels, which have expanded over 160 countries across the world. They’ve done this by using human beings and human trafficking and treating them like dogs. The flow of illegal drugs in this country is unmatched in history, and they also have illegal vaping devices that are harming our communities and killing our kids, all being imported from China through the cartels. This has to stop. Kamala Harris’ borders are deliberately obliterated the US border to flood the country with illegals, they canceled the wall, they implemented catch and release, and terminated Remain in Mexico, and effectively shut down ICE, pulling those agents off of the front line, putting them in administrative duties to do paperwork and change diapers, meanwhile, the front door of our country’s wide open. President Trump will stop this. I’ve got a serious question, has the border [inaudible 01:39:01] toured the southern border?

Audience (01:39:05):

No.

Justin Harris (01:39:05):

Didn’t think so. Has President Donald Trump toured the border?

Audience (01:39:09):

Yes.

Justin Harris (01:39:10):

Yes, he has. And I heard the cartels went running. On average, there’s over 5,000 illegal immigrants are being released into the country every day. Our country. We don’t know who they are, don’t know where they came from, we can’t even account for them. For 38 straight months, the monthly border encounters have been higher than even the highest month seen under the Trump administration. You can’t tell me this isn’t being done deliberately, because it is.

Audience (01:39:43):

Intentional.

Justin Harris (01:39:44):

In 2023 alone, more than 900,000 illegal immigrants were released into the interior of the US, unaccounted for, waiting for court dates, and nobody knows where they’re at. That’s the entire city of Mesa flowing into our country, and that’s the only ones we know about. Illegal drugs are flowing into this country at an alarming rate with only five dissent being intercepted at the border.

Donald Trump (01:40:10):

[inaudible 01:40:10] got to go.

Justin Harris (01:40:10):

Okay.

Audience (01:40:10):

We love you Trump.

Justin Harris (01:40:23):

You got it. Folks, let me finish up here please. This country, our family, our communities, and everything that each of us holds dear and near to our hearts, cannot endure another four years of a clueless president that cares more about the color of her curtains than the safety and prosperity of our great country and its people. It is clear who supports law enforcement, law and order, and that’s President Trump. His unwavering show of commitment to the rule of law of men and women who place their lives on the line every day. So if you support national security and want to secure borders, vote Trump. If you support law enforcement and safe communities, vote Trump. If you support getting our country back on track and making America great again, vote Donald J. Trump for president. And this is why the Arizona Police Association and our 12,000 members family and friends are proud to extend our endorsement to Donald J. Trump for President of the United States of America. Thank you, God bless.

Donald Trump (01:41:51):

[inaudible 01:41:50].
(01:41:51)
Thank you very much. Wow, that’s a great endorsement, means a lot.

Audience (01:41:55):

[inaudible 01:41:58].

Donald Trump (01:41:57):

So, just in closing, I want to say that from the moment we take back the White House from Kamala Harris and crooked Joe Biden, crooked as a four dollar bill… Used to say three dollar bill, now we say four dollar bill. I believe we’re going to have the four greatest years in the history of our country. Starting on day one, I will seal the border and stop the migrant invasion of our country. We will carry out the largest deportation operation in American history, larger even than President Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1950s, who was a big believer in borders. We will defeat inflation, and we will make America affordable again, you’re going to have an affordable country again. We will make America the dominant energy producer in the world, by far, it won’t even be close.
(01:43:01)
Remember, as I always say, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country in the world, including Saudi Arabia, including Russia, and we will use it to reduce taxes and energy costs for our people. We will reduce your energy bills in one year by more than 50%, that’s here and that’s everywhere in the country. And that includes heating, air conditioning, electricity, and gasoline for your car. I will turn the United States into a manufacturing superpower, more than it has ever been, ever, ever, ever before. We will bring back jobs to America, we will no longer allow foreign countries to take our jobs and to steal our wealth, we will make our own products and we will buy far less from foreign countries that we are buying right now. We’re going to make it here.
(01:44:02)
Other countries that make us pay a tax to do business with them will be charged the same tax when they send their product into the United States, it’ll be called the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act. And if China or any other country charges us a 100% tax or tariff, then we will charge them a reciprocal tariff of 100 or 200%. In the words of a great president, William McKinley, the protective tariff policy of the Republicans has made the lives of our countrymen sweeter, brighter, brighter, brighter, brighter, and it’s the best our citizenship and our civilization can ever have, better destiny for our people, we ought to take care of our own nation, and we have to take care of our industries first. We have to take care of our country first. It’s about time, and it’s going to happen starting on January 20th of next year.
(01:45:15)
I will not let Mexico, China, or any other country sell cars into the United States to the detriment of our autoworkers all over our country, including in Michigan and South Carolina. United Auto Workers, you’re going to vote for Trump because I’m going to bring you back more auto production than you’ve ever seen in this country before. I will end the ridiculous electric vehicle mandate, cut every job-killing regulation of the Harris-Biden administration, and make our auto manufacturing business bigger, better, and stronger than it has ever been before. And if you relied on Kamala, there would be no auto industry, within three years you’ll never make another car. When I’m back in the White House, we will pass large tax cuts for our workers, and there will be, as I said, no tax on tips.
(01:46:23)
And that means if you’re a restaurant worker, a bartender, hospitality worker, caddy, barber, mover, driver, or anyone else who relies on tip income, your tips will be 100% yours to keep, you will no longer be harassed by your government. And I will fight for and protect your social security and your Medicare with no cuts and no changes in age. We’re not going to move it up, they want to move it up five years, we’re not doing it. “Darling, when do we get our social security?” ” Well, they just moved it up five years, you’re not going to happen with me, it’s going to happen with them, they’re going to destroy your social security.” And we will have no tax on social security benefits for seniors.
(01:47:19)
They destroyed our seniors and everyone else with their horrible inflation, and then they give you small dollars with social security and they want you to pay tax, I don’t know. We don’t need it, we can do it, we have so much else, including that liquid gold… Oh, we’re going to go hunting for liquid gold. We will cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, and we will terminate the green new scam and spend that money on roads, bridges, real infrastructure, and paying down debt. No fake infrastructure that has caused massive inflation, with no benefit whatsoever to our population. I will settle the war in Ukraine, and I will end the chaos in the Middle East, and we will restore peace through strike, and it will happen quickly. I will have that war ended before I go to the White House on January 28th, I will have the war in Ukraine ended as President-elect.
(01:48:26)
And we will end the weaponization of government against the American people, including myself, by the way. They’ve weaponized the government against the political opponent, can you imagine? But you just saw, we won the big case down in Florida, everyone said, “Ohhh…” They weaponized it, they got their justice department to go after their political opponent, but they’re not doing well. I’m the only one that ever happened to where my numbers went up, what do you think about that, Mr. Congressman? I don’t think it’s ever happened. They go after me and my numbers go up, somebody’s got to explain it. We will rebuild our cities, including Washington D.C., making them safe, clean, and beautiful once again, and we will keep the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency because right now it is under siege.
(01:49:23)
And this is how we will end the era of inflation, mayhem, and misery under Kamala and crooked Joe, and unleash safety, prosperity, peace for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. Together we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest costs, low inflation. And that’s for everyone, we’re talking about everyone. We want to make sure everyone can afford groceries, a car, and a home. We will stop the invasion, end migrant crime, support our great police, strengthen our military, build a missile defense shield around our country, keep critical race theory and transgender insanity out of our schools, and we will keep men out of women’s sports.
(01:50:26)
We will defend the Second Amendment, and we are going to restore, those people don’t allow it, the fake news doesn’t allow it, we will restore free speech in our country, and we will secure our elections, Mr. Congressman. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with joy and opportunity, and hope. But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris, a new name. We must stop her country-destroying liberal agenda once and for all. We have to put an end to it. So, get your friends, get your family, register, volunteer, and get out to vote. We want a landslide that is too big to rig, too big to rigged. Right? Right, Deb?
(01:51:24)
On November 5th, we will save our country, we will save our economy, we will rescue our middle class, we will reclaim our sovereignty and restore our borders, we will put America first, and we will take back our country. And together we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. So strong. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. We will make America free again. And we will make America great again. God bless you all. God bless you. Thank you very much. Thank you Arizona. God bless you all.

Tonight, I’m very pleased to welcome a man who has been an incredible champion for so many of these values that we all share, and we’ve shared them for a long time. I don’t think too many of you people have heard of him. He’s very low-key, he’s a very low-key person, but he’s highly respected.

… and millions of people would destroy our country, but we’re going to get those people out, the people that came in here from jails and prisons and mental institutions. But they threw them out. They ran against each other for the primary and she never even made it to the first state, the great state of Iowa, never made it, and now she’s the one running. A little strange, isn’t it? You see, that’s really a threat to democracy if you get right down to it, right? In our movement, we know that democracy does not mean rule by the Democrat establishment, it means rule by the American people. Tonight, I’m very pleased to welcome a man who has been an incredible champion for so many of these values that we all share, and we’ve shared them for a long time.

Donald Trump (02:03:35):

For the past 16 months Bobby has run an extraordinary campaign for president of the United States, I know, because he also went after me a couple of times, I didn’t like it. And I mean this sincerely, had he been allowed to enter the Democrat primary he would’ve easily beaten Joe Biden, but they wouldn’t let him in.

Donald Trump (02:04:02):

They put up rules. I’ve never seen rules like he had to have 65% of the vote in order to run, little things like that.
(02:04:10)
His candidacy has inspired millions and millions of Americans, raised critical issues that have been too long ignored in this country, and brought together people from across the political spectrum in a positive campaign, grounded in the American values of his father, Robert Kennedy, a great man, and his uncle, President John F. Kennedy.
(02:04:37)
And I know that they are looking down right now and they are very, very proud of Bobby. I’m proud of Bobby. You want to know the truth?
(02:04:52)
And I don’t think I’ve ever introduced anyone that got applause like he just got. I must tell you, I don’t think it’s true. I don’t think I’ve ever introduced anybody that got applause like that.
(02:05:18)
Amazing. It’s true.
(02:05:18)
Amazing. Soon after I was, I can’t even believe I have to say this, nearly assassinated in Pennsylvania last month, Bobby called me to express his best wishes. He knows firsthand the risks incurred by leaders who stand up to the corrupt political establishment. When you stand up, you bring on some trouble for yourself, but you have to do what’s right. You have to do what’s right for the country. I will tell you, we are both in this to do what’s right for the country. That’s one thing I can tell you.
(02:06:10)
He lost his father and uncle in service to our country, and Bobby himself was subject to repeated threats to his safety during the course of his campaign, while being denied protection by the Harris-Biden administration.
(02:06:25)
And this is a tribute, in honor of Bobby, I am announcing tonight that upon my election, I will establish a new independent presidential commission on assassination attempts, and they will be tasked with releasing all of the remaining documents pertaining to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. And they will also conduct a rigorous review of the attack last month. But I tell you, I have never had more people ask me, “Please, sir, release the documents on the Kennedy assassination,” and we’re going to do that.
(02:07:27)
And I also want to salute Bobby’s decades of work as an advocate for the health of our families and our children. Nobody’s done more.
(02:07:37)
Millions and millions of Americans who want clean air, clean water and a healthy nation have concerns about toxins in our environment and pesticides in our food. That’s why, today, I’m repeating my pledge to establish a panel of top experts working with Bobby to investigate what is causing the decades-long increase in chronic health problems and childhood diseases, including autoimmune disorders, autism, obesity, infertility, and many more. We want every child in America to grow up and to live a long and healthy life.
(02:08:22)
So I just want to ask Bobby to speak for a little while. I’ll stand aside. I’m going to stand aside. But I can only tell you, I’ve known him a long time. We’ve been a little bit on the opposite side of the equation. But I will say this, he is a brilliant… I still think of him as young, he’s not that young. I always call him young, but he’s not that young. But he is a phenomenal person, a phenomenal man who loves the people of this country as much as anybody can love the people of this country.
(02:09:01)
So, Bobby, please, say a few words. Thank you very much.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (02:09:15):

Thank you.
(02:09:15)
Thank you, President Trump.
(02:09:29)
Thank you. A few hours after his assassination attempt at Butler, I got a call from a safe food advocate named Calley Means, who’s been fighting for many years to try to end the corruption at CDC and FDA and USDA. And these institutions, these regulatory agencies are actually run by the big food processing companies, the big ag and the chemical companies they’re supposed to regulate. And he said to me, he’d been advising me for many years and on my campaign, and he told me that night that he was also advising President Trump. And he asked if I would talk to President Trump, and I said, “Of course.” And about a few minutes later, I got a call from the president and we talked, we had a very good talk. And then he invited me to come see him the next day and I went to Minneapolis and saw him. We met again a couple of weeks later in Florida. And we talked about, not about the things that separate us because we don’t agree on everything, but on the values and the issues that bind us together. And one of the issues that he talked about was having safe food and ending the chronic disease epidemic.
(02:11:19)
Our children are now the unhealthiest, sickest children in the world. Don’t you want healthy children? And don’t you want the chemicals out of our food? And don’t you want the regulatory agencies to be free from corporate corruption? And that’s what President Trump told me that he wanted.
(02:11:48)
He also told me that he wanted to end the grip of the neocons on US foreign policy. He said he didn’t want any more $200 billion wars in Ukraine, that we could use that money back here in the United States.
(02:12:18)
And the safest, the best way to build a safe America is to rebuild our industrial base and rebuild the middle class in this country. And don’t you want a president who’s going to get us out of the wars and who’s going to rebuild the middle class in this country?
(02:12:50)
And he told me that he wanted to end the censorship, because the whole basis of American democracy is the free flow of information. And we know that a government that can silence its opponents has license for any kind of atrocity. And can you think of any time that you can look back in history and say that the people who were censoring were the good guys? They’re always the bad guys, because it’s always the first step down that slippery slope to totalitarianism. And don’t you want a president who’s going to protect America’s freedoms…
(02:13:41)
And who is going to protect us against totalitarianism? And I want to ask you again, don’t you want a safe environment for your children? Don’t you want to know that the food that you’re feeding them is not filled with chemicals that are going to give them cancer and chronic disease? And don’t you want a president that’s going to make America healthy again?
(02:14:37)
Thank you all very, very much and God bless you, and God bless America.

Now let’s just reflect, now that we’re in day three of the Democrat National Convention, how bizarre it is that they’re doing some of the things that they’re doing. Normally conventions, they celebrate nominees who are elected by the people. And let’s remind ourselves, how many votes has Kamala Harris won in the Democratic primary? Zero. Zero.

Audience (00:21):

None!

J. D. Vance (00:21):

That’s exactly right. 10 million legal aliens, but zero votes. That is the record of Kamala Harris. Now remember, the party bosses installed Kamala Harris because they can control her. That’s all this is about. Her agenda is not an agenda for the American people, it’s an agenda for the people who have gotten rich off the decline of this country. And we are not going to take it, are we?

J. D. Vance (00:47):

Now remember, it was her donors, it was Kamala Harris’s donors, who got rich when we shipped millions of manufacturing jobs off to China and other countries. Americans, we got poor. Her donors got rich when America printed trillions of dollars to fund her green scam policies. But Americans, we paid higher prices for groceries and housing because of it. And now her party wants more power. And the way they’re going to do it is that she wants to give all those illegal aliens the right to vote.

Audience (01:23):

No!

Boo!

J. D. Vance (01:23):

But out here in the state of North Carolina, we believe the only people who get to vote in our elections are the people who have our right to be here, not illegal aliens, Kamala Harris. And this November, starting right here, the great state of North Carolina, we’re going to send a message to the corrupt leaders of this country. We do not need a president selected by power brokers, we need a president for the people, and that’s why we’re going to send Donald J. Trump back to the White House. There is so much, so much at stake in this election. Think of everything that this country has endured over the last four years of Kamala Harris’s broken leadership. Prices are up and wages down. Our borders are wide open, but we’ve had a lot of factories closing down. Fentanyl is available on every street corner from North Carolina to Wisconsin, but it is impossible for young Americans to find an affordable home to raise their families in. Now, Donald J. Trump represents something that so many in this country need right now, and I think it’s important to recognize that we need hope in the United States of America. Hope that we can reignite this economy and bring back prosperity to American citizens. Hope that we can raise our kids in secure neighborhoods and safe streets. Hope that we can renew the patriotism that binds us as a country together, one nation under God. My friends, for a lot of us, for a lot of the people that we fight for, the American Dream seems out of reach today, the most out of reach it’s been in a generation. But in 75 days, we’re going to save the dreams of every single American, and it will mark the beginning of the future all of us deserve, and we’re going to do it together. Now, we’re here to talk about national security today, and saving the American Dream, let’s be honest, it starts with peace. Peace in our neighborhoods, peace in our cities, and peace at the southern border. Lord willing, we bring back the leadership of Donald J. Trump, we’re going to have peace all over the entire world. He did it once before, and I think he’s going to do it again.
(03:56)
Now, if we don’t have safety for our families, if we don’t have security for our country, we don’t have anything. And I’m a firm believer that when we talk about national security, national security starts right here at home, right here in the great state of North Carolina. And there’s been no greater area where Kamala Harris has failed to deliver peace and national security than at the American southern border. It is a disgrace, my friends. I cannot believe how bad it is.
(04:26)
Now, the media will lie to you and tell you that she was never the border czar. You heard that? Even though they all said she was the border czar for three and a half years. And remember that as border czar, Kamala Harris has allowed a literal invasion of this country, more than 10 million illegal aliens, and she’s refused to deport the people who were already here. So, that makes about 25, 25 million illegal aliens that are in this country right now. Now, our brave border patrol officers, they plead, they beg for her support. I was down there at the southern border and I saw it. Giant sections of President Trump’s border wall sit right there, rusting, waiting to be installed, but she refuses to do her job. And you think it’s bad now? If we give Kamala Harris a promotion and make her the president of the United States, the southern border is going to look like Walmart on Black Friday, ladies and gentlemen, it’s going to be no good, no fun at all.
(05:25)
Now, while she offers amnesty for the people who’ve broken our laws, we have a different message. President Trump and I have a different message. To all the criminal illegals who flooded across Kamala’s wide-open southern border, pack your bags, because in six months, you are going home. Now, just weeks ago, I actually visited the southern border, which means that I’ve visited the southern border more than our border czar, Kamala Harris. I saw where little girls are trafficked by the drug cartel, some of the most vile people in the world, taking advantage of innocent little children and making money off of them. I met a rancher who endured violent criminals raiding his land, just a rancher in Arizona trying to get by. And I see the desperation of families torn apart by the fentanyl and all the other poison the cartels are bringing into our country.
(06:22)
Now, I know the hurt of that poison very personally. A lot of you know my story. I remember being a kid whose mom struggled with addiction. I remember waiting at the bedside of my mom, angry that she had taken something that she shouldn’t have taken, but just praying, “Lord Jesus, please let her wake up. Let her make it through this time.” And we got to remember, my friends, because of Kamala Harris’ border policies, way too many of our loved ones are not waking up. Way too many kids have been orphaned, way too many grandparents are raising kids they didn’t expect to raise, because Kamala Harris allowed the drug cartels to wage war on this country. I think it’s time to wage war on the drug cartels, and that’s going to start with Donald Trump’s leadership.
(07:14)
Now, the president’s going to be here in just a few minutes, but I almost feel bad for him, because this is not the first time that Donald Trump is going to have to clean up somebody else’s mess. Now remember, in 2016, he took over from Barack Obama, who let ISIS spread mayhem all over the world. Then Trump came along, and in a couple weeks, did what the media said could not be done: he wiped them off the face of the earth. And remember, when we win this November, and it’s going to start right here in North Carolina, I think the cartels are next. We’re going to do just to them what Donald Trump did to ISIS. Now I will admit, it is hard to make sense of Kamala Harris’s foreign policy, especially when she explains it like a third grader who didn’t study for a class presentation. Have you ever seen Kamala talk about the Ukraine-Russia war?

Audience (08:15):

It’s a load of [inaudible 00:08:17].

J. D. Vance (08:20):

Okay, I’d recommend you go and see it, but wait until November, because you’re going to lose about 20 IQ points when you watch Kamala Harris talk about Russia and Ukraine, and we need that over the next few months. We need you guys in top form. So, don’t watch it just yet. But she’ll say, “Ukraine is a country in Europe, and Russia is a country in Europe.” And then you say, “Okay, what comes next, Kamala?” And the answer is nothing comes next, because she doesn’t know what the hell she’s talking about.
(08:53)
But if you want to give her the benefit of the doubt and understand her foreign policy, remember that she bragged on CNN about playing a key role in the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. Now, that was before 13 innocent service members died at the Kabul Airport. That was about three years ago to the day. That was before the world witnessed panicked civilians cling to the sides of retreating American airplanes, and that was before they gave the Taliban billions of dollars, paid for by you, billions of dollars of helicopters, planes, humvees, and artillery. It was the worst humiliation this country has endured since the fall of Saigon, and Kamala Harris says she’s proud of what she did.

Audience (09:39):

It was treason!

J. D. Vance (09:40):

It was treason. And is it any wonder that Putin then invaded Ukraine on her watch? Or that Iran attacked Israel on her watch? Or that, this very moment, China is ramping up its aggression against Taiwan on her watch? When Kamala Harris walks in the room, America’s enemies sense weakness. And that’s why we have got to fire Kamala Harris, not give her a promotion.
(10:11)
Now, she wants to represent America all over the world, but she’s terrified to face a friendly media. Does anyone think that the person who runs from the friendly American press could stand up to Vladimir Putin, or Kim Jong Un, or Xi Jinping? Of course you couldn’t. So, if you believe that a strong America requires a strong leader, I’ve got a recommendation for you. Why don’t we reelect President Donald J. Trump?
(10:46)
And while we’re on the topic, don’t send her stolen valor sidekick, send a former Marine, send J. D. Vance to be vice president. We got some Marines out there, [Latin 00:11:03]? Now Kamala Harris, she gets really mad when I bring up the stolen valor of her running mate. But let me tell you why it matters. Every single person here understands why this matters. Here’s the record on Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota: he dropped out of the military and allowed his unit to go to Iraq without him. And he knew they were going to Iraq. He lied about it, but he knew they were going to Iraq. Even his chaplain called him a coward. And those of you who served in the military know the chaplain is the nicest person in the unit. If the chaplain is calling you a coward, you must’ve really screwed up.
(11:39)
He claimed to carry a weapon in war. But you ask him, “Tim, what war have you ever been in?” And the answer is, he’s never been to a single war, he lied about it. He lied about his rank, and he stood in silence as Nancy Pelosi and a lot of journalists praised him for his service on an imaginary battlefield, instead of correcting the record. What won’t stolen valor Tim Walz fib about? In fact, I believe at his next speech, he’s probably going to say he survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. I think that’s what Tim Walz is going to claim next time. Now, look, we don’t criticize, and this is where the media is dishonest here. We don’t criticize Tim Walz for his years of service in the National Guard. We condemn him for lying about that service for political gain. It’s disgraceful, and nobody should tolerate it. Now, Tim Walz needs to not only explain why he abandoned his guard unit, he also needs to explain his bizarre love affair with China. Have you seen this? This guy’s been to China more than the US ambassador to China. He got married in China. He visited China over 30 times. He honeymooned in China. He taught a course approved by the Communist Party in China. He even brought American high school students with him on visits to China. Now I know, and we all know, that Kamala Harris wanted to outsource our factories and jobs to China, but I didn’t expect her to outsource the selection of her running mate to China too.

Audience (13:12):

She’s a commie! She’s a commie!

J. D. Vance (13:15):

But here’s the problem in choosing him for vice president. It’s not just about Tim Walz, it’s about Kamala Harris’ terrible judgment. We do not need a president with terrible judgment, we need Donald J. Trump back in the White House. Nothing matters in national security and foreign policy more than judgment, because nobody knows what’s going to happen. Nobody knows what crisis is going to erupt over the next four years. And I got to be honest with you, my entire adult life has been shaped by presidents who threw Americans into unwise wars and then failed to win them. And if we’re being honest, it wasn’t just Democrats, it was sometimes Republicans too.
(13:58)
And what did Donald Trump do? He stood up to the chickenhawks. He bucked the foreign policy establishment. Even sometimes he resisted pressure from within his own party. In President Trump’s four years in office, we had zero new wars. We had peace all over the world when Donald J. Trump was president. In the Middle East, he brokered the Abraham Accords, brought stability and created a long-term balance to Iran. In Europe, he pushed the Europeans to take more responsibility for their own defense, so the United States would not have to pay for a bunch of freeloaders. We ought to focus on our own security, not subsidize European welfare. They can take care of themselves. And never forget, as much as the Democrats said that Donald Trump was somehow on the side of Russia, the only president of the last 20 years who had Russia not invade a neighbor was the presidency of Donald J. Trump. He kept Russia in check. He’s the only president of our lives to do it. Under Kamala Harris, Putin invaded Ukraine. But under Donald Trump, Putin didn’t do a damn thing.
(15:24)
And that’s because of strong leadership. People respected him. And that’s, by the way, my friends, why we were able to defend our own border, is because Donald Trump didn’t have us distracted by fighting wars that we had no business being involved in. We got to focus on our own border right here at home. That is the Donald Trump principle, and that’s what we’re going to bring back to the White House.
(15:53)
It’s funny, all these people said that he was going to start a nuclear war, but President Trump knew more about diplomacy than any president of the last 40 years. In Asia, he opened diplomatic talks with North Korea after a half century of stagnation. And you remember when he went to North Korea, he met with Kim Jong Un, the leader of that country. And if you know anything about Kim Jong Un… Well, how do I say this politely? Kim Jong Un doesn’t miss a whole lot of meals, okay, my friends? And Trump stands there with the media and Kim Jong Un. You remember this? I’d encourage you to go look it up. And he brings the media in and he says, “All right, everybody, take some photos of us, make us look nice, make us look skinny.” And Kim Jong Un sat up like that.
(16:40)
It means something, to have a president who’s not afraid to go into hostile territories, tell a few jokes, and actually engage in diplomacy. That preserves peace. While all these Democrats lied about Donald Trump being the candidate of nuclear war, Donald Trump is the person who prevented nuclear war. And if we’re not careful, Kamala Harris is going to walk us right into nuclear war. We got to kick her out, and not give her a promotion to president of the United States.
(17:14)
And maybe, maybe the most important thing Donald Trump did, is he began the process of ending America’s economic reliance on China. The most important thing, because Donald Trump understands economic security is national security. The whole world knows that China doesn’t have better workers than America, but they’re willing to lie, cheat and steal to win. They lied about unleashing COVID-19. They cheat and they ignore trade rules. And they steal America’s intellectual property. Now, Kamala Harris lets China get away with all of it. And China Tim helps her.
(17:52)
Donald Trump isn’t going to let China steal a damn thing. He’s not going to let them steal our factories, not going to let them steal our jobs, not going to let them steal the American dream from American workers. Donald Trump will not allow America to be dependent on Chinese medicine for our children. That’s a big thing. So much of what we put into the bodies of our children is made in China. Doesn’t make any sense. And Donald Trump will tell China that if they don’t stop sending fentanyl into our city, there is going to be hell to pay. No more of that crap. We need somebody who stands up for American workers. Now, the establishment loves to complain about President Trump’s approach to diplomacy. They don’t like the way that he talks. Have you seen this?

Audience (18:42):

To hell with them!

J. D. Vance (18:43):

Why is it that our leaders are so careful with their words, but so reckless with their actions? I prefer a different kind of statesmanship. One that stands up to the crowd, one that stands for American interests, and that pursues those interests ruthlessly but also carefully. With strong words and the strongest military in the world, but with great restraint to balance it out. Donald Trump’s presidency was the first disruption to the failed consensus and the terrible consequences that it wrought. So I say let them whine about Donald Trump’s tweets. Because let’s be honest, folks, mean tweets and world peace has a pretty nice ring to it. I think we ought to bring it right back. We have got a once in a lifetime opportunity to reelect a man who proven he’s too big for the deep state bureaucracy. He’s too tough for the tyrants all over the world. He was too strong even for an assassin’s bullet. Ladies and gentlemen, let’s return to a time when the bravest man leads this nation with strength. That man is Donald J. Trump. He was the once president of the United States, and we in North Carolina, we’re going to make him the future president of the United States. God bless you, North Carolina. Thank you. Let’s win this race, let’s do it together. God bless you all.

MUSIC (20:29):

(30:24)
Just talkin’ ’bout life, goin’ sip for sip.
(30:24)
Yeah, you, you know you love to fight.
(30:26)
And I say shit I don’t mean. But I’m still gon’ wake up wantin’ you and me.
(30:33)
I know that last night we let the liquor talk.
(30:33)
I can’t remember everything we said, but we said it all.
(30:33)
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met.
(30:46)
But, baby, baby, something’s tellin’ me this ain’t over yet.
(30:46)
No way it was our last night, last night.
(31:05)
No way it was our last night, last night.
(31:05)
No way it was the last night that we break up.
(31:06)
I see your tail lights in the dust.
(31:09)
You call your mama, I call your bluff.
(31:11)
In the middle of the night, pull it right back up.
(31:11)
Yeah, my, my friends say, “Let her go.”
(31:11)
Your friends say, “What the hell?”
(31:11)
I wouldn’t trade your kind of love for nothin’ else.
(31:22)
Oh, baby, last night we let the liquor talk.
(31:22)
I can’t remember everything we said, but we said it all.
(31:22)
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met.
(31:41)
But, baby, baby, something’s tellin’ me this ain’t over yet.
(31:41)
No way it was our last night, we said we’d had enough.
(31:42)
I can’t remember everything we said, but we said too much.
(31:42)
I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left.
(31:42)
But baby, baby, something’s tellin’ me this ain’t over yet.
(31:42)
No way it was our last night, last night.
(31:42)
No way it was our last night, last night.
(31:42)
I know you said this time you really weren’t comin’ back again.
(32:14)
But, baby, baby, something’s tellin’ me this ain’t over yet.
(32:15)
No way it was our last night, last night.
(32:15)
No way it was our last night, last night.
(32:15)
Coming out of my cage and I’ve been doing just fine.
(32:15)
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all.
(32:15)
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
(32:15)
It was only a kiss.
(32:15)
It was only a kiss.
(32:15)
Now I’m falling asleep and she’s calling a cab.
(32:54)
While he’s having a smoke and she’s taking a drag.
(32:54)
Now they’re going to bed, and my stomach is sick.
(32:54)
And it’s all in my head.
(32:54)
But she’s touching his chest now.
(32:54)
He takes off her dress now.
(32:54)
Let me go.
(34:49)
And I just can’t look.
(34:49)
It’s killing me.
(34:49)
And taking control.
(34:49)
Jealousy.
(34:49)
Turning saints into the sea.
(34:49)
Swimming through sick lullabies.
(34:49)
Choking on your alibis.
(34:49)
But it’s just the price I pay.
(34:49)
Destiny is calling me.
(34:49)
Open up my eager eyes.
(34:49)
‘Cause I’m Mr. Brightside.
(34:49)
I’m coming out of my cage and I’ve been doing just fine.
(34:49)
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all.
(34:49)
It started out with a kiss.
(34:49)
How did it end up like this?
(34:49)
It was only a kiss.
(34:49)
It was only a kiss.
(34:49)
Now I’m falling asleep and she’s calling a cab.
(34:49)
While he’s having a smoke and she’s taking a drag.
(34:49)
Now they’re going to bed and my stomach is sick.
(34:49)
And it’s all in my head.
(34:49)
But she’s touching his chest now.
(34:49)
He takes off her dress now.
(34:49)
Let me go.
(34:49)
‘Cause I just can’t look, it’s killing me.
(34:49)
And taking control.
(34:49)
Jealousy.
(34:49)
Turning saints into the sea.
(34:49)
Swimming through sick lullabies.
(34:49)
Choking on your alibis.
(34:49)
But it’s just the price I pay.
(34:49)
Destiny is calling me.
(34:49)
Open up my eager eyes.
(34:49)
‘Cause I’m Mr. Brightside.
(34:49)
I never.
(34:49)
I never.
(34:49)
I never.
(34:49)
I never.
(34:49)
I hopped off the plane at LAX with a dream and my cardigan.
(34:49)
Welcome to the land of fame excess.
(34:49)
Whoa.
(34:49)
Am I gonna fit in?
(34:49)
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time.
(34:49)
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign.
(34:49)
This is all so crazy.
(34:49)
Everybody seems so famous.
(34:49)
My tummy’s turnin’ and I’m feelin’ kinda homesick.
(34:49)
Too much pressure and I’m nervous.
(34:49)
That’s when the taxi man turned on the radio and a Jay-Z song was on.
(34:49)
And a Jay-Z song was on.
(34:49)
And a Jay-Z song was on.
(34:49)
So, I put my hands up. They’re playin’ my song, the butterflies fly away.
(34:49)
I’m noddin’ my head like, yeah.
(34:49)
Movin’ my hips like, yeah.
(34:49)
I got my hands up. They’re playin’ my song.
(34:49)
They know I’m gonna be okay.
(34:49)
Yeah. It’s a party in the U.S.A.
(34:49)
Yeah. It’s a party in the U.S.A.
(34:49)
Get to the club in my taxi cab, everybody’s looking at me now.
(37:29)
Like, “Who’s that chick that’s rockin’ kicks? She gotta be from out of town.”
(37:36)
So hard with my girls not around me.
(37:37)
It’s definitely not a Nashville party.
(37:46)
‘Cause all I see are stilettos.
(37:46)
I guess I never got the memo.
(37:46)
My tummy’s turnin’ and I’m feelin’ kinda homesick.
(37:46)
Too much pressure and I’m nervous.
(37:46)
That’s when the DJ dropped my favorite tune and a Britney song was on.
(37:46)
And a Britney song was on.
(37:46)
And a Britney song was on.
(37:46)
So, I put my hands up. They’re playin’ my song, the butterflies fly away.
(37:46)
I’m noddin’ my head like, yeah.
(37:46)
Movin’ my hips like, yeah.
(37:46)
I got my hands up. They’re playin’ my song.
(37:46)
They know I’m gonna be okay.
(37:46)
Yeah. It’s a party in the U.S.A.
(37:46)
Yeah. It’s a party in the U.S.A.
(37:46)
Feel like hoppin’ on a flight. On a flight.
(37:46)
Back to my hometown tonight. Town tonight.
(37:46)
Something stops me every time. Every time.
(37:46)
The DJ plays my song and I feel all right.
(37:46)
So, I put my hands up. They’re playin’ my song, the butterflies fly away.
(37:46)
I’m noddin’ my head like, yeah.
(37:46)
Noddin’ my head.
(37:46)
Movin’ my hips like, yeah.
(37:46)
Ooh, yeah.
(37:46)
I got my hands up. They’re playin’ my song.
(37:46)
They know I’m gonna be okay. Gonna be okay.
(37:46)
Yeah. It’s a party in the U.S.A.
(37:46)
Yeah. It’s a party in the U.S.A.
(37:46)
So, I put my hands up. They’re playin’ my song, the butterflies fly away.
(37:46)
Flying away.
(37:46)
I’m noddin’ my head like, yeah.
(37:46)
Noddin’ my head like, yeah.
(37:46)
Movin’ my hips like, yeah.
(37:46)
Movin’ my hips like, yeah.
(37:46)
I got my hands up. They’re playin’ my song.
(37:46)
They know I’m gonna be okay.
(37:46)
I’m gonna be okay.
(37:46)
Yeah. It’s a party in the U.S.A.
(37:46)
Yeah. It’s a party in the U.S.A.
(37:46)
Josie’s on a vacation far away.
(37:46)
Come around and talk it over.
(37:46)
So many things that I want to say.
(37:46)
You know I like my girls a little bit older.
(37:46)
I just wanna use your love tonight.
(37:46)
I don’t wanna lose your love tonight.
(37:46)
I ain’t got many friends left to talk to.
(37:46)
No one’s around when I’m in trouble.
(37:46)
You know I’d do anything for you.
(37:46)
Stay the night but keep it undercover.
(37:46)
I just wanna use your love tonight, whoa.
(37:46)
I don’t wanna lose your love tonight.
(37:46)
Try to stop my hands from shakin’.
(37:46)
Somethin’ in my mind’s not makin’ sense.
(37:46)
It’s been awhile since we were all alone.
(37:46)
I can’t hide the way I’m feelin’.
(37:46)
As you leave me, please, would you close the door?
(37:46)
And don’t forget what I told you.
(37:46)
Just ’cause you’re right, that don’t mean I’m wrong.
(37:46)
Another shoulder to cry upon.
(37:46)
I just wanna use your love tonight. Yeah.
(37:46)
I don’t wanna lose your love tonight.
(37:46)
Yeah, I just wanna use your love tonight.
(37:46)
I don’t wanna lose your love tonight.
(37:46)
I just wanna use your love tonight.
(37:46)
I don’t wanna lose your love tonight.
(37:46)
Lose your love.
(37:46)
Lose your love.
(37:46)
Tonight.
(37:46)
Lose your love.
(37:46)
I don’t wanna lose.
(37:46)
Lose your love tonight.
(37:46)
I don’t wanna. I don’t wanna. I don’t wanna lose.
(37:46)
Lose your love tonight.
(37:46)
No. No.
(37:46)
Lose your love tonight.
(37:46)
Lose your love tonight.
(37:46)
No. No.
(37:46)
I don’t wanna lose your love tonight.
(37:46)
Lose your love tonight…
(37:46)
I’m just trying to be a father.
(43:42)
Raise a daughter and a son.
(43:45)
Be a lover to their mother.
(43:48)
Everything to everyone.
(43:48)
Up and at ’em bright and early.
(43:53)
I’m all business in my suit.
(43:56)
Yeah, I’m dressed up for success from my head down to my boots.
(44:02)
I don’t do it for the money.
(44:05)
There’s bills that I can’t pay.
(44:07)
I don’t do it for the glory.
(44:11)
I just do it anyway.
(44:14)
Providing for our future’s my responsibility.
(44:20)
Yeah, I’m real good under pressure.
(44:23)
Being all that I can be.
(44:24)
And I can’t call in sick on Mondays when the weekend’s been too strong.
(44:31)
I just work straight through the holidays.
(44:34)
And sometimes all night long.
(44:37)
You can bet that I stand ready when the wolf growls at the door.
(44:43)
Hey, I’m solid. Hey, I’m steady.
(44:46)
Hey, I’m true down to the core.
(44:49)
And I will always do my duty.
(44:52)
No matter what the price.
(44:55)
I’ve counted up the cost.
(44:59)
I know the sacrifice.
(44:59)
Oh, and I don’t want to die for you.
(45:04)
But if dyin’s asked of me, I’ll bear that cross with honor.
(45:10)
‘Cause freedom don’t come free.
(45:16)
I’m an American soldier, an American.
(45:18)
Beside my brothers and my sisters, I will proudly take a stand.
(45:24)
When liberty’s in jeopardy, I will always do what’s right. I’m out here on the front lines.
(46:00)
Sleep in peace tonight.
(46:00)
American soldier. I’m an American soldier.
(46:00)
Yeah, an American soldier. An American.
(46:00)
Beside my brothers and my sisters, I will proudly take a stand.
(46:17)
When liberty’s in jeopardy, I will always do what’s right.
(46:17)
I’m out here on the front lines.
(46:19)
So, sleep in peace tonight.
(46:21)
American soldier. I’m an American.
(46:21)
An American.
(46:21)
An American soldier.
(46:21)
It was 1989.
(48:07)
My thoughts were short, my hair was long.
(48:10)
Caught somewhere between a boy and man.
(48:17)
She was 17 and she was far from in-between.
(48:18)
It was summertime in northern Michigan. Splashing through the sandbar.
(48:36)
Talking by the campfire.
(48:38)
It’s the simple things in life like when and where.
(48:41)
We didn’t have no internet.
(48:41)
But man, I never will forget.
(48:41)
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair.
(48:41)
And we were trying different things.
(49:10)
And we were smoking funny things.
(49:10)
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song.
(49:10)
Sipping whiskey out the bottle.
(49:10)
Not thinking ’bout tomorrow.
(49:10)
Singing, “Sweet Home Alabama” all summer long.
(49:10)
Singing, “Sweet Home Alabama” all summer long.
(49:10)
Catching walleye from the dock.
(49:10)
Watching the waves roll off the rocks.
(49:10)
She’ll forever hold a spot inside my soul.
(49:29)
We’d blister in the sun.
(49:31)
We couldn’t wait for night to come.
(49:32)
To hit that sand and play some rock ‘n’ roll.
(49:32)
While we were trying different things.
(49:32)
And we were smoking funny things.
(49:32)
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song.
(49:32)
To our favorite song.
(49:32)
Sipping whiskey out the bottle.
(49:32)
Not thinking ’bout tomorrow.
(49:32)
Singing, “Sweet Home Alabama” all summer long.
(49:32)
Singing, “Sweet Home Alabama” all summer long.
(49:32)
Sweet Home Alabama. Oh, yeah.
(49:32)
Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change.
(49:32)
Or how we thought those days would never end.
(51:05)
Sometimes I hear that song and I start to sing along.
(51:09)
And think, “Man, I’d love to see that girl again.”
(51:12)
Man, I’d like to see that girl again.
(51:20)
And we were trying different things.
(51:20)
Trying different things.
(51:20)
And we were smoking funny things.
(51:20)
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song.
(51:20)
To our favorite song.
(51:20)
Sipping whiskey out the bottle.
(51:20)
Not thinking ’bout tomorrow.
(51:20)
Singing, ” Sweet Home Alabama” all summer long.
(52:04)
We were trying different things.
(52:04)
And we were smoking funny things.
(52:04)
Smoking funny things.
(52:04)
Making love down out by the lake to our favorite song.
(52:04)
Favorite song.
(52:04)
Sipping whiskey out the bottle.
(52:04)
Not thinking ’bout tomorrow.
(52:04)
Singing, “Sweet Home Alabama” all summer long.
(52:04)
Singing.
(52:04)
Singing, “Sweet Home Alabama” all summer long.
(52:04)
Singing.
(52:04)
Singing, “Sweet Home Alabama” all summer long.
(52:04)
Singing.
(52:04)
Singing, “Sweet Home Alabama” all summer long.
(52:05)
All summer long.
(52:06)
Singing, “Sweet Home Alabama” all summer long.
(53:00)
All summer long.
(53:00)
Singing, “Sweet Home Alabama.” Yeah.
(53:00)
Singing all summer long.
(53:00)
There must be lights burning brighter somewhere.
(53:03)
Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue.
(53:10)
If I can dream of a better land.
(53:15)
Where all my brothers walk hand in hand.
(53:18)
Tell me why, oh why, oh why can’t my dream come true?
(53:18)
Oh, why?
(53:18)
There must be peace and understanding sometime.
(53:40)
Strong winds of promise that will blow away all the doubt and fear.
(53:48)
If I can dream of a warmer sun.
(53:52)
Where hope keeps shining on everyone.
(53:53)
Tell me why, oh why, oh why won’t that sun appear?
(59:07)
We’re lost in a cloud with too much rain.
(59:07)
We’re trapped in a world that’s troubled with pain.
(59:07)
But as long as a man has the strength to dream.
(59:07)
He can redeem his soul and fly.
(59:07)
He can fly.
(59:07)
Deep in my heart there’s a trembling question.
(59:07)
Still I am sure that the answer, answer’s gonna come somehow.
(59:07)
Come somehow.
(59:07)
Out there in the dark.
(59:07)
Out there in the dark.
(59:07)
There’s a beckoning candle. Oh, yeah.
(59:07)
And while I can think, while I can walk.
(59:07)
While I can stand, while I can talk.
(59:07)
While I can dream.
(59:07)
While I can dream.
(59:07)
Please let my dream come true.
(59:07)
Right now.
(59:07)
Oh, let my dream.
(59:07)
Oh, let it come true right now.
(59:07)
Oh, let my dream.
(59:07)
Oh, yeah.
(59:07)
Thank you. Goodnight.
(59:07)
We’re caught in a trap.
(59:07)
I can’t walk out.
(59:07)
Because I love you too much, baby.
(59:07)
Why can’t you see.
(59:07)
What you’re doing to me, when you don’t believe a word I say?
(59:07)
We can’t go on together with suspicious minds.
(59:07)
With suspicious minds.
(59:07)
And we can’t build our dreams.
(59:07)
On suspicious minds.
(59:07)
So, if an old friend I know.
(59:07)
Stops by to say hello.
(59:07)
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
(59:07)
Here we go again.
(59:07)
Asking where I’ve been.
(59:07)
You can’t see the tears are real, I’m crying.
(59:07)
Yes, I’m crying.
(59:07)
We can’t go on together with suspicious minds.
(59:07)
Suspicious minds.
(59:07)
And we can’t build our dreams on suspicious minds.
(59:07)
Oh, let our love survive.
(59:07)
I’ll dry the tears from your eyes.
(59:07)
Let’s don’t let a good thing die.
(59:07)
When, honey, you know I have never lied to you.
(59:07)
Yeah. Yeah.
(59:07)
We’re caught in a trap.
(59:07)
I can’t walk out.
(59:07)
Because I love you too much, baby.
(59:07)
Why can’t you see what you’re doing to me.
(59:07)
When you don’t believe a word I say?
(59:07)
Don’t you know I’m caught in a trap?
(59:07)
I can’t walk out.
(59:07)
Because I love you too much, baby.
(59:07)
Well, don’t you know I’m caught in a trap?
(59:07)
I can’t walk out.
(59:07)
Because I love you too much, baby.
(59:07)
Don’t you know I’m caught in a trap?
(59:07)
I can’t walk out.
(59:07)
Because I love you too much, baby.
(59:07)
Oh, don’t you know I’m caught in a trap?
(59:07)
I can’t walk out.
(59:07)
Because I love you too much, baby.
(59:07)
Don’t you know I’m caught in a trap?
(59:07)
I can’t walk out.
(59:07)
Because I love you too much, baby.
(59:07)
Oh, don’t you know I’m caught in a trap?

MUSIC (01:00:13):

Yeah, and I’ve set up and tore down this stage with my own two hands.
(01:00:18)
We’ve traveled this land packed tight in minivans.
(01:00:20)
And all this for the fans, girls, money and fame.
(01:00:22)
I played their game.
(01:00:22)
And as they scream my name.
(01:00:22)
I will show no shame.
(01:00:22)
I live and die for this.
(01:00:22)
And if I come off soft then chew on this. Are you scared?
(01:00:35)
Devil without a cause.
(01:00:37)
And I’m back with the beaver hats and Ben Davis slacks.
(01:00:40)
30 pack of Stroh’s, 30 pack of hoes.
(01:00:43)
No Rogaine in the propane flow.
(01:00:46)
The chosen one, I’m the living proof.
(01:00:48)
With the gift of gab from the city of truth.
(01:00:51)
I jabbed and stabbed and knocked critics back.
(01:00:53)
And I did not stutter when I said that.
(01:00:59)
I’m going platinum, selling rhymes.
(01:00:59)
I went platinum, seven times.
(01:00:59)
And still they ill, and wanna see us fry.
(01:01:04)
I guess because the Only God Knows Why, Why, Why, Why, why, ooh.
(01:01:06)
They call me cowboy, I’m the singer in black.
(01:01:06)

J. D. Vance (01:14:07):

Ladies and gentleman, please welcome the next vice president of the United States, Senator JD. Vance.

MUSIC (01:14:25):

Why don’t we liberate these United States.
(01:14:28)
We’re the ones who need it worst.
(01:14:28)
Let the rest of the world help us for a change.

J. D. Vance (01:14:33):

Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready to hear the next President of the United States? Oh, come on. I said, are you ready to hear from the next president of the United States? Let’s remember eight years ago, Donald Trump had everything you could want, fame, fortune, family, friends. He gave the easy life up so that we could get our country back. He traded, he traded everything for an unjust persecution, for slander, for scorn, so that we could save the United States of America. Now, they couldn’t beat him at the ballot box, so they tried to bankrupt him. They failed at that, so they tried to impeach him. They failed at that. So they tried to put him in prison and they even tried to kill him. But as sure as that beautiful flag still waves behind me in the American sky, Donald Trump still stands ready to fight, ready to win, ready to make America great again. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome my friend and our president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.

Donald Trump (01:18:18):

Thank you very much. Thank you very much, everybody. It’s great to be here. What a place. Did you like the flyover? That was pretty good. We were going low and fast. We went. That was moving along. It was pretty low. Just want to thank JD. He’s doing a fantastic job and I want to thank North Carolina. I love North Carolina. I love them. 76 days from now, we’re going to win this state and we’re going to win the White House. That beautiful, beautiful building. That beautiful building.
(01:18:49)
I want to thank Senator Ted Budd who’s doing such a great job. Senator Ted Budd, thank you. Thank you. Great job, Ted. Mark Robinson. He’s out there. He’s fighting. He’s fighting. He’s a great one. And I think we have a lot of our sheriffs here. Don’t we have… Where are they? Will this stage hold them? I’d love to bring them up. Come on sheriffs. Get up here. Mark, come on.
(01:19:21)
I don’t know if the stage is going to hold them, but if it doesn’t, we’ve had bigger risks than this. Come on, sheriffs. If you weigh more than 200 pounds, don’t come up. I’m only kidding. Come on. Hi, fellas.
(01:20:31)
[inaudible 01:20:32]
(01:20:31)
I don’t know if this thing is going to hold it, but if it doesn’t, we’re not going to get [inaudible 01:20:36] Just so you know, these are great people, but I want to get them the hell off the stage. I guarantee they didn’t have this in mind when they built this. Thank goodness, Mark lost a lot of weight over the last couple of months. I’m very… You did actually. Well, I want to thank you all very much. You are the reason we’re able to be here and that you have a safe state and a great state. Thank you all very much. Thank you.
(01:21:34)
That’s some group of people for endorsements too. Every group, virtually in the country, law enforcements, endorsed us. Thank you very much. Thanks, Mark. Good luck, Mark. We’ll win. Got to win. He’s got to win. Got to win. He’s a good man. Thank you. Oh, I feel much better. I feel very much better that they got off the stage. I had no idea what was going to happen, but it’s not that far down.
(01:22:02)
I had no idea what was… I’m a big structural guy, but I want to thank also members of Congress, Richard Hudson and Byron Donalds. Two Warriors. Two great people. Two unbelievable. Where’s Byron? Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Where’s Byron? Look at him over there. He knows how to get attention. Look at that guy. He’s been my friend for a long time. Thank you for everything, Byron.

Audience (01:22:30):

[inaudible 01:22:33]

Donald Trump (01:22:33):

And you have. Thank you very much. Congressional candidate, Mark Harris. Mark. Hi, Mark. Good going, Mark. Good numbers. Good numbers. Brad Knott and Addison McDowell. They’re all going to be winners very soon. Young, good looking people. Thank you very much. Great.
(01:22:54)
The state house speaker, Tim Moore. Tim? Where is Tim? Oh, he’s nice and safe back there. Hello, Tim. I appreciate it, Tim. And Neal Jackson, state rep, Neal Jackson. Thank you very much. Thank you, Neal. RNC chairman Michael Whatley. What a job he’s doing. What a job he’s doing. And North Carolina GOP Chairman, Jason Simmons, who’s been a friend of ours for a long time. Where’s Jason? Nice tall, character right here. Thank you very much, Jason.
(01:23:31)
And somebody that’s been with me for day one. He’s a real general. We have the real generals and we have the fake woke generals that did so poorly in Afghanistan, should have all been fired. But this is a real general, Keith Kellogg. Right, Keith?
(01:23:47)
And this is a great group. It’s good to see you Keith. He’s been with me from before day one, right? He said, that guy should run. We got to get him to run. I like those guys. They were here before I ran. Quite a few of them too. We have the front row, Joes. You know that? And very importantly, we have the most magnificent women. First time, we have… They travel all over the country to be with us for rallies. They’re close to a couple of hundred rallies. I don’t know what their husbands are doing about this. This is a little crazy. Look how beautiful.
(01:24:21)
And they’re from North Carolina. And for a change, they don’t have to travel so far. Right? How far are you from here?

Audience (01:24:31):

Two hours.

Donald Trump (01:24:32):

Two hours is nothing. It’s a pretty big state actually. Thank you very much. As always, you are special, special people. Great women. They love our country. Before we begin, I want to address the massive scandal around the revised job numbers that were just announced this morning. A little while ago, just before I came up, I got to see them.
(01:24:53)
And it really isn’t a revision. It’s a total lie. Total lie. There’s never been any revision like this. They wanted it to come out after the election, but somehow it got leaked. It got leaked. Government leaks too. The Harris-Biden administration has been caught fraudulently manipulating jobs, statistics to hide the true extent of the economic ruin that they’ve inflicted on America. The new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the administration padded the numbers with an extra, listen to this one, 18,000 jobs that don’t exist. So they said they existed and they never did exist.
(01:25:42)
They built them up so that they could say what a wonderful job they’re doing. No, we’ve never had numbers like this. They don’t exist. They thought they could do it sometime after… We have an election coming up very quickly. But they wanted this to come out after November 5th when it wouldn’t have meant so much, but it came out a little early, so there’s a patriot in there someplace, right?
(01:26:04)
The real numbers are much worse than that. And Comrade Kamala, she’s comrade. The most radical left person ever to run for a high political office in our country gets another four years, millions of jobs, and it’ll vanish overnight. She gets four more years, you’re going to see jobs vanish. Millions and millions will vanish and inflation will completely destroy our country. We’ll have inflation worse than they’ve given us. When I gave it to them, I had virtually no inflation, and now their number’s up to 22, 23%. But their real number is probably 40 to 50% because a lot of the things in their numbers aren’t included.
(01:26:48)
I saw another one where the FBI releases crime statistics and they weren’t that bad, and then they left out little things like New York, Chicago. They left out various areas and that wasn’t so good. Your life savings will be totally wiped out if you put somebody like that in there with him, how about him? How about him? She’ll destroy our country just like she destroyed San Francisco, just like she destroyed California.
(01:27:21)
With the Trump victory, we’ll once again have the greatest economy in history. We’re going to do things that are going to make us so great so fast. We’re going to bring it back. We’re going to make America strong again. We’re going to make America great again. It’s going to be fantastic. It’s going to be fantastic. So I just want to thank you very much for your support because I’ve always had fantastic support from you. Thank you.

Audience (01:27:58):

USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.

Donald Trump (01:27:58):

Thank you very much.

Audience (01:27:58):

USA, USA, USA, USA.

Donald Trump (01:28:01):

We have a job to do. We have a job to do.

Audience (01:28:04):

Yes, sir.

Donald Trump (01:28:04):

We had some very good polls this morning despite their charade. I call it the party, the Democrats Party. Do you know five people in Chicago were killed in the last little while since that charade that they have going on? They mentioned my name, I think 271 times. They mentioned the economy like 12 times. They mentioned the border. Maybe none. They don’t talk about the border. Our great border czar doesn’t talk about the border, but they mentioned me more than any other category. I’m now a category. They had me down today as a category.
(01:28:38)
That’s all they talk about. Trump. We’ve driven them crazy. They have Trump derangement syndrome. We’ve driven them crazy and they should be driven crazy. They’ve done a terrible job for our country in every single way. There’s not a thing they’ve done well except cheat and lie. They lie about stats. No, they lied about the crime numbers. The crime numbers, it didn’t look bad. Then they found out that many of the worst places weren’t included in the numbers, and that was done by the FBI, which is sad.
(01:29:07)
Four years ago, our country was strong and respected like never before. Our allies admired us. Our enemies feared us because everyone knew that as an American president, I was all about putting America first. That’s true. Under my leadership, we rebuilt the United States military, created Space Force, and we made our allies pay their fair share and their fair dues. We went to NATO. We say, “You’re not paying. You got to pay.” If you remember, President Bush would go and he’d make a speech. Obama would go, he’d make a speech. They all made speeches. This one didn’t even make a speech, this last one. But I went, I said, “Nobody is paying. You got to pay.” And they did pay hundreds of billions of dollars. They said, “Well, does that mean you won’t support us if we don’t pay?” I said, “That’s what it means.” I had to say that. I got a lot of heat for that. People,

Donald Trump (01:30:00):

The fake news. Oh, that’s a lot of fake news. Oh, that’s a lot of fake news. No, the fake news gave me a hard time for that. The fake news was saying, “What a terrible thing to say to our allies.” Our allies weren’t paying. I said, “You got to pay.” We were paying for everybody. So they take advantage of us on trade and then we also pay for their military. That somehow doesn’t work, so they had to pay. They paid hundreds of billions of dollars. But I said to them, “No, that means I will not protect you. I will not protect you.” They said, “Sir, if we’re attacked by Russia, will you protect us?” Used to be Soviet Union, now Russia, “Will you protect us?” They said, “Are you paid?” “No, let’s assume we’re not paid. Then you’re delinquent, right?” “Well, yes.” That’s an old real estate term. “You’re delinquent.” “Yes.” “No, we will not protect you.” The press went crazy that I said… And you know what? If I would’ve said the other way, they would’ve never paid.
(01:30:58)
Hundreds of billions were sent in to NATO but we defeated ISIS, we killed the world’s top terrorists. We secured our borders. We achieved energy independence, we stood up to China, we protected Israel. We made peace in the Middle East with the Abraham Accords and more, more, more, we did things like nobody ever heard of, and we brought our troops mostly back home. We didn’t start any wars for 79 years, it was before. We didn’t start wars, 79, 80 years. Everybody said, “Oh, he’s going to start wars with his attitude.” No, my attitude kept us out of wars. I stopped wars with phone calls. Russia should have never happened with Ukraine, would’ve never happened if I were president. Would’ve never happened, nope, there was no talk of that. Would’ve never, ever happened, with Putin, would’ve never happened.
(01:31:49)
And Israel, October 7th, would’ve never happened. Iran would’ve never done that. They had very little money at that point. Now they’re rich as hell, but Biden allowed that to happen. And Kamala. Where’s Biden? What happened to Biden, where is he? He’s on a beach. He’s on a beach. He’s got somebody that thinks he looks great in a bathing suit. He likes to go to a beach. How do you leave here and go on a beach? You can’t do it. There are things you just don’t do. People don’t want to see you in a bathing suit. Walks badly. It’s hard to walk in the sand. He has a hard time lifting his feet through the sand, and then he grabs the chair. The chair is meant for old people to lift and young kids to lift like 4-year-old kids, right? And he can’t lift it. He needs a little help.
(01:32:38)
The whole thing is crazy. How we ever got that is crazy, and what happened to our country with inflation and with disrespect from all over the world and all these wars are starting all over the place, and we’re very close to a third world war and don’t kid yourself, because they’re laughing, but they’re not laughing too much. They’re a little worried about a certain person winning the election. We had some very good polls today. And if that happens, you’re not going to have any third world wars. Every American was safer under President Trump. In fact, the entire world was safer when I sat behind that beautiful resolute desk in the Oval Office.
(01:33:18)
I heard the other day, for the first time, I heard Biden say, “The beautiful, resolute desk.” He never said that before. They copy me. When I say, “We’re nation in decline,” guys are copying me. Then they say they shouldn’t say that, but they thought the words were beautiful, but they copy me all the time. In that case, it was Republicans that were copying me because they happened to be right so I don’t mind if a Republican copies me. Any of you guys want to copy me. But it’s a sad thing to have to say, but they copy me. The resolute desk. He never mentioned that. He doesn’t even know what the hell the resolute desk is.
(01:33:54)
Exactly three years ago this month, the weakness and incompetence of Kamala Harris and Crooked Joe Biden delivered the most humiliating event in the history of our country and one of the biggest military disasters in the history of the world as far as I’m concerned. No one will ever forget the horrifying images of their catastrophic retreat from Afghanistan. Desperate Afghans fell to their deaths from the wheels of US cargo planes that were 3,000 feet up in the air, blood-thirsty terrorists poured out of the prisons after Biden and Harris surrendered Bagram, one of the largest air military bases anywhere in the world. We spent billions and billions of dollars building it many years ago, and it was important to keep it. I was never leaving that. I would’ve been out faster than them. I said… That stuff were there for 20, almost 21 years, and I said, “What are we doing? What are we doing here?” And we had no soldiers killed for 18 months while I was there because they knew don’t play around with our soldiers. They were killing them. They were killing them under Obama.
(01:35:05)
Did you see Barack Hussein Obama last night take little shots. He was taking shots at your president. And so was Michelle. They always say, “Sir, please stick to policy. Don’t get personal.” And yet they’re getting personal all night long, these people. Do I still have to stick to policy?

Audience (01:35:26):

No.

Donald Trump (01:35:26):

“Sir, you must stick to policy. You’ll win it on the border. You’ll win it with inflation. You’ll win it with your great military that you built that they gave away, $85 billion worth of it, in Afghanistan. Sir, you’re going to win it on crime.” The crime is running through the streets like never before. “You’re going to win it on all of these things,” and maybe especially, I think two things, the economy, inflation, because I view them together, what they’ve done to inflation and they caused it with energy. What they did with energy is so stupid. If we there, our energy, we would be so dominant all over the world right now, we were already energy-independent. I made you energy-independent, but we would be energy dominant. We’d be paying back debt. We’d be reducing your taxes still further. We gave you the largest tax cuts ever. And a lot of good things were going to happen, but now we’re just going to have to sort of call it a delay of four years.
(01:36:20)
But these people don’t have any idea what they’re doing. You had 13 heroic US service members were tragically and needlessly killed. I got to know a lot of the relatives, friends and mothers and fathers of those 13 people. 45 others were horrifically wounded and 85 billion worth of the best military equipment anywhere in the world was handed over to these people. In fact, Afghanistan is now one of the largest arms merchants anywhere in the world. Did you know that? They’re selling our equipment at tremendous prices. They’re selling our beautiful… We had 70,000 armored trucks, many of them armored. Armored trucks and vehicles. Think of this, we had 700,000 rifles and guns. Seven. I actually say, what the hell did they need so many for? 700,000 rifles and guns. We had goggles, brand new, right out of the box. They didn’t fight at night because they never had goggles, right? Good fighters. They never had goggles.
(01:37:25)
Now they have brand new goggles all left by the Biden Harris administration. Gave them billions and billions of dollars, just gave it to them. And now they sell that equipment because they don’t need 700,000 rifles. They need 20,000, little difference. They don’t need 70,000 vehicles, they need 500 vehicles. You have to ask yourself, who bought all that stuff in the first place? Who bought it all? How disgusted we’re all, when we see, all of us are, when we see three days ago when we viewed their parade, our military equipment running down the middle of their main avenue, brand new beautiful armor-plated trucks, tanks and vehicles running down the middle and they’re all celebrating because we have stupid people running our government and she’ll be worse than Biden because he wasn’t really a believer, but she’s a radical left believer.
(01:38:28)
She ruined San Francisco, she ruined California. And if she gets in, our country doesn’t have a chance. This calamity is on comrade Kamala Harris’s shoulders. I think her name will be comrade because I think that’s the most accurate name. I’ve been looking for a name. People are saying, “Sir, don’t do it.” You know all my names, they’ve all worked. They’ve all been very successful, and I really didn’t find one with her. “Sir, she’s a woman.” I said, “So is Hillary Clinton, I called her Crooked Hillary.” Nobody complained about that, right? Right? Mr. Governor, nobody complained about that. No, I called her Crooked Hillary. I called people names. I call crazy Nancy Pelosi crazy because she is, she’s nuts.
(01:39:17)
Biden is really angry. He is very angry. He was so angry the other night, he’s like seething. You ever see a guy make a speech, such anger and so uncomfortable, just shouting, but he’s terrible. He’s just terrible. Should have never been there, we all know that, should have never been there. What they’ve done to this country is incredible. But she bragged that she would be the last person in the room, and she was, she was the last person in the room with Biden when the two of them decided to pull the troops out of Afghanistan. And by the way, pulling them out was absolutely right. I was going to do it. I’m the one that got the soldiers down to 5,000 people. I was going to do it, but we were going to get out last. You don’t pull the soldiers out first. You let the soldiers stay last. And the head of the Taliban respected me. Abdul, I had conversations with him.
(01:40:12)
After my conversations, not one soldier in 18 months was killed, but you pull the soldiers out last. Milley and these guys, we have great generals, but Milley and Mattis and these guys, they didn’t know what the hell… I call them television generals. The television generals are no good. But the generals that defeated ISIS for me were great. We have a great military. But she had the final vote. She had the final say, and she was all for it. You take the soldiers out. If I took that young person right there, about five or six years old, beautiful young person, and if I said, I gave little details, like about 30 seconds worth of details, “Would you take the military out first or last?” “Sir, I’d take the military out last.” But they took it out first, and then we left hostages, we left all of the equipment, we left everything, and we left Bagram.
(01:41:07)
And now China is occupying Bagram. Bagram being one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons. Wouldn’t it be nice to have our big fat, beautiful base? It was probably built there for that reason. But China, one hour away, and now China is occupying that massive big base. Some of the biggest runways in the world, they could hold heavier loads than any runways in the world. Under my leadership, we were getting out of Afghanistan, but we were going to get out with dignity, pride and with strength. When I left office, we had not lost a single service member in the combat in Afghanistan in more than 18 months. And then we had that horrible day where we lost so many. And so many were so badly hurt; arms, legs gone, face just obliterated. We lost so many great people that day. Nobody talks about the people that were so badly injured, they never mention them. I always mentioned them.
(01:42:10)
All over the world, our adversaries knew that America was not to be trifled with when I was your Commander in Chief. And it’s very interesting, if you look at Hungary, very strong country, very strong leader, Viktor Orbán. He said, ” The only thing that’s going to save the whole world is Trump has to be president again. We had no problems. We had no problems.” He said, “We had no problems.” I don’t use the term, but he did. He said, “China was afraid of him. Russia was afraid of him.” They always said, oh, I was so friendly to Russia. I’m the one that stopped the Russian pipeline called Nord Stream 2. Nobody ever… The biggest development they ever had to feed oil all over Europe. I stopped it. And then Biden comes in and he gives him everything. He gave him the pipeline. They built the pipeline, but I stopped it. Putin said, “That’s the worst thing that’s ever happened to us.” I said, “I’m sorry, I have to do it.” And he approves it right away.
(01:43:13)
And then they say, “Trump was not strong on Russia.” I think they would [inaudible 01:43:20] it wrong. Putin actually said, “If you weren’t strong, I’d like to find out how bad would you be if you were strong? Because you were brutal.” But I got along with him. It’s good to get along with these countries. I got along with China, that wouldn’t have happened, what’s happening right now. They’re planning an attack on Taiwan. There’s no question about that. That wouldn’t have happened. Wasn’t going to happen. They knew that you weren’t allowed to do that. Putin would’ve never gone into Ukraine. Israel would’ve never been attacked. It’s a sad, sad situation. So many people are dead. So many people are gone. So many cities. You look at Ukraine, those cities are just wiped off the face of the earth. They’re outside of Kiev and a couple of others that basically just flattened. Far more people dead than they let you know. It’s like your numbers that were released fraudulently today, far more people dead in that war than anybody would know. When those big buildings come tumbling down, hit with rockets, so ridiculous.
(01:44:16)
There’s nothing left. It’s so ridiculous. But since the Afghanistan catastrophe, it’s been open season on America and our allies. I really believe that the Afghan disaster, what happened, the stupidity and the way we pulled out and the bedlam and all of that, it would’ve been very smooth. We were going to get out with strength and dignity. But when Putin saw that, he said, “Wow, those people don’t know what they’re doing. They’re overrated.” And he went in, and same thing happened with Iran. Iran was not going to play with us, and now Iran is a rich nation. They have $300 billion. They had no money, and in three and a half years they made 300 billion. $300 billion they have right now. They made it all in three and a half years. They had none when I left, and we would’ve made a fair deal with them. They can’t have a nuclear weapon, very simply. You can’t have a nuclear weapon. Other than that, we want you to have great lives. But I do hear they’re after me, but that’s the way it is.
(01:45:16)
Look, I’m here for you and I’m here even for the world. We want to stop world wars because the equipment is so devastating now. A world war is obliteration. We can’t have a world war. Every dictator, tyrant and terrorist on the planet knows that they can get away with murder under Kamala and Crooked Joe. Kidnappers are getting millions and millions of dollars, but now they’re getting billions. They’re getting billions. What did you get for the four people that we released? Sure, they got $6 billion. What is 6 billion? Does anyone know what that means, 6 billion? They got $6 billion. People get kidnapped and they ask for like, “How about a thousand dollars? How about 500?” They got $6 billion from these idiots.
(01:46:04)
And you know what happens? When that happens, a lot of people are going to get kidnapped because they say we’re dealing with stupid people. A lot of people. We had 59 people that were hostage. Some in North Korea. That’s about as tough as it gets. We got people out with paying for anything. We never gave money. We didn’t want to give money. If we gave money, all they do is they go around kidnapping everybody. These people give, not only do they give 6 billion, they got the prince of death out. He’s the number one arms merchant in the world. Russia got him as part of one of the deals. The number one arms merchant in the world, and we got a couple of people, but why were they there? And why did they do what they did? But they got some of the most criminal, the toughest, meanest criminals anywhere in the world. On top of that, we paid them billions and billions of dollars.
(01:47:04)
We’re run by very stupid people. I’d like to use a different word. I’d like to use a much more sophisticated word, but there’s no word I can think of. Incompetent. How about incompetent? As a result, peace in Europe has been shattered by the largest European land war since the fall of Nazi Germany. This is the largest war there’s been, and this war is going to escalate and escalate. When, if, but when? I have to always say if because they cheat. I would say when, if they didn’t cheat, but they cheat. That’s the one thing, they great at cheating in elections. If we win, I’ll get that thing settled before I take the office. I’ll get it settled as president elect, I’ll get that war stopped, with Russia.
(01:47:52)
Yeah, we’ll get that stopped. Ukraine and Russia, we’re going to get it stopped and quickly. It’ll be done before I get to office. It would not have happened if I was president. It wasn’t going to happen. In the Middle East, the Jewish people have suffered the worst atrocities and deadliest attacks since the Holocaust. There’s no question about that. The United States has been forced to abandon more embassies under comrade Kamala than at any time in our history. And we’re running out. It’s not like we’re leaving. We’re being run out of these embassies that cost us hundreds of millions of dollars to build. You’re going to see these embassies in the middle of nowhere in a country you’ve never even heard of. They spent 900 million to build an embassy. The whole thing is crazy.
(01:48:39)
The world is on fire and Kamala and Biden have marched us to the brink of World War III. That’s what we’re in. I think general, you would probably agree. You’re one of the experts I would think, right? I don’t even talk to you about that lately it’s so out of control. I don’t even have to bother. I just say, “Look, take a look.” But one of the great experts, and we’re on the brink. That’s why this November Americans are going to tell Kamala Harris, “Kamala, that we’ve had enough. We can’t take it anymore. You’re doing a terrible job. Comrade Harris, you’re fired. Get out of here. You’re fired. You’re no good. You’re fired.” Get them out of here.
(01:49:27)
All you have to do is take a look at San Francisco. Look at the job she did. She had one policy. If you steal less than a thousand dollars, basically 950 to be exact, I want to be accurate for purposes of reporters, the fake news media, they want accuracy. They don’t have to be accurate, but we have to be accurate. But if you steal less than $950, they basically leave you alone. So have guys going in robbing stores with a calculator. Let’s see, this is a hundred dollars. Did you notice? This is not going to happen in North Carolina, I don’t think. Is it? Let’s see, that’s a hundred. That’s $59, bing, bing, bing, bing. Stop, stop, we don’t want to go over 950. They walk out with it, nobody does a thing.
(01:50:15)
Starting the moment I lift my hand from the Bible after taking the oath of office, I will move to restore America to maximum strength and return the world to peace. We’re going to return the world to peace. And mostly, I can do it with a telephone call. We don’t have to send troops. I can do it with a telephone call. You go to war with another country that’s friendly to us or even not friendly to us, you’re not going to do business in the United States, and we’re going to charge you 100% tariffs. And all of a sudden the president or prime minister or dictator or whoever the hell is running the country says to me, “Sir, we won’t go to war.” I talked this world out of a lot of wars with telephone calls. I don’t have to send in the troops. One of my most urgent priorities will be to quickly rebuild the readiness and spirit of the United States Armed Forces, and we had it built. We rebuilt it. We rebuilt the whole military, but it was decimated under this group of stupid people.
(01:51:25)
We had so much. When I came in, we had no ammunition. Did you know that? Remember I used to talk about it and I said, “If it’s true,” which it was, “why would you say that?” We had people on television, well, United States has no ammunition. Some things you just keep to yourself. Do you remember I used to, from North Carolina, do you remember I used to talk about that all the time? Those are my best witnesses, those ladies. There’s about 40 of them. They’re all over the place, and they’re always perfectly coiffed and perfectly dressed. They’re beautiful and they’re great. But no, I used to talk all the time. If you have no bullets, I can ask this group of leaders, you don’t talk about it, but you get the bullets really fast, right? So within a year, I had so much that our warehouses were stocked to the gills. We never had so much. I bought so much, missiles, everything.
(01:52:21)
I rebuilt our military, but that’s been all dissipated now again, because we give it away to everybody and for nothing. I mean, they don’t do anything for us. We don’t get anything. We don’t even get a pledge that, “We’ll pay you back someday if we have the money.” How about that? “Pay you back someday if we have the money.” I sponsor athletes sometimes if I see somebody that I like in sports. I sponsor some golfers, usually doesn’t typically work out. I don’t know if you know it’s like a 5,000 to one shot, but I’m good at that stuff and I can see talent and I’ll give them a few thousand dollars. I’ll give them $50,000. I’ll say, “You’re really good. You could make it. Why aren’t you trying out for the tour?” “Sir, I have no money. I have to give lessons. I have no money.”
(01:53:11)
I said, “You’re too good to give lessons. You can be a tour player.” “Sir, I don’t have any money.” I say, “Here’s $50,000. And here’s the deal, if you do well, you pay me back with no interest. Just good luck. If you don’t do well, which you probably won’t, because it’s very hard.” They say the worst is a boxer. If you sponsor a boxer, they’re all great, they’re winning all their fights and then they turn professional and they go in. And this goes with UFC, run by Dana White, one of the greats of all time, which has really taken over for boxing. But it’s the same thing, and people sponsor people and they get what they get. But the worst is that…

They need a medic.

Donald Trump (01:54:01):

A doctor, please.

Audience (01:54:01):

You [inaudible 01:54:17], Mr. President.

Donald Trump (01:54:18):

It is very hot here, I noticed. It’s very hot. And a lot of the people waited for days to get here, so I understand it. Take your time, doctor. Take your time. Thank you.

Audience (01:54:33):

We love you, Trump.

Donald Trump (01:54:33):

Yeah, take your time please.

Audience (01:54:33):

We love you, Trump.
(01:54:33)
We love you, sir.
(01:54:33)
Mr. President, shake my hand.

Donald Trump (01:56:22):

They come two days, three days early, and it’s a lot of stress. We lose it. The only ones we don’t lose are Front Row Joes. I don’t know what they have going. They have something going here, Governor. Thank you very much. Thanks, doctor.
(01:56:38)
But America’s blessed with the greatest military in the world, but our men and women in uniform have been betrayed by radical left politicians and some generals. At the top, they’re woke. They’re woke. We don’t want woke generals. We want generals that know how to win, and we have them. We proved that when we wiped out ISIS, didn’t we? Proved it. “Sir, it’ll take five years.” We did it in three weeks. I think we did it in three weeks. We have the greatest military in the world, but you need the great leaders. Otherwise, your military can never be great.
(01:57:10)
Everywhere I go, soldiers and veterans tell me how angry they are that not one person has been held accountable for the Afghanistan catastrophe. He never fired anybody. I fire a lot of people when they don’t do a good job. Then they come back and write books. They hate you, but that’s okay. When you don’t fire people, they never write books. But I fired a lot of people, I wasn’t happy with their service. I wasn’t happy with the job they did, and I’d fire them. I let them go. I mean, I’m working for you. I’m not doing this for myself.
(01:57:46)
But when you fire them, they always come back with something, and now nobody’s ever been in the position where they get offered all sorts of money from the fake news and everything else. And fame, “We’re going to make you famous. All you have to do is make up some stories about Trump.” But people don’t seem to care. It’s phony stuff, phony, horrible. They’re lightweights. They’re terrible people. When I came, don’t forget, I didn’t know anybody in Washington. I’m President of the United States, I’m going down Pennsylvania Avenue with that biggest load of military and police on motorcycles and everything you’ve ever seen, and I didn’t know anybody. I said to my wife, “I don’t know a lot of people, but the people I know, I got recommendations from a lot of good people, well-meaning people.” Some were good, most were great, but we had some bad ones too. But now I know them all in Washington. I know the good ones, the weak ones. Guys like this. I know the weak ones and the bad ones. General, we know the dumb ones and the smart ones, don’t we? We know them all.
(01:58:49)
But the voters will hold Kamala and Joe accountable for this November when I take office, and they’re going to be held accountable for what they’ve done to this country. Thank you. I will ask for the resignations of every single senior military official who touched the Afghanistan disaster. I want their resignations immediately. And I want them on the desk in the Oval Office, the resolute desk. I want them on at 12 o’clock inauguration day, everybody involved with that disaster. When you have a disaster so stupid as that, that caused us such problem. You don’t know what that’s done to the reputation of our country, the Afghanistan disaster. This house cleaning will be a signal to the entire world and America military and everybody else. They want people to be held accountable for failure and incompetence. And it’s just not acceptable that something like that could happen. These are fighters, they fight with broken old obsolete weapons and knives.

Donald Trump (02:00:00):

We have F-16s, we have F-35s, we have F-32s, and we were knocking the hell out of them, just knocking the hell out of them. It was easy, but I said, “What the hell are we doing this for? Let’s get there hell out of there.” We were getting out with such strength, they were so happy, they couldn’t believe in. And then these people came in and it’s horrible to even think about what happened, and countries all over the world lost respect for us because of Afghanistan. We demand success and we demand victory. We want victory for our soldiers and from everybody else.
(02:00:41)
Under comrade Kamala Harris, and I call her that because there’s never been … She’s a Marxist, okay? I was saying, “Do you think she’s a Marxist or a communist to people that really study this stuff?” They weren’t able to tell me. They said it could be all the way, could be communist, but she’s damn close. They said it was definitely one or the other, but they couldn’t actually tell me was it communist or Marxist serious? “Sure, it’s one of the other, we’re not sure. We’ll figure it out.” But under comrade Kamala, our military has been abused for radical social experiments.
(02:01:21)
On day one, I will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our US Armed Forces. We’re taking it out. Our warriors should be focused on defeating America’s enemies, not figuring out their genders. By that time, hopefully they know their genders. Marxist ideologies have no place in combat. Think of it. They go in and they decide, “Oh, they’re going to change my gender.” No, no. We want them to know their gender when they go in. You have no idea the disruption that that has caused and the fake news refuses to report it.
(02:02:04)
When I did a ban, I went to a lot of good generals, I said, “I’m not going to tell you names. Just tell me is it the right thing or the wrong thing?” “The wrong thing, sir, it’s a wrong thing.” And I had unanimous support, and then we did it. I didn’t do it. Other people did it. They reversed me as soon as they got in, almost the first day. I didn’t do it, but they allowed things to happen to our military that just not right. If you want to have a sex change or a social justice seminar, then you can do it somewhere else, but you’re not going to do it in the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Air Force, Space Force or the United States Marines, sorry, You’re not going to do it there.
(02:02:51)
The military brass that led these absurd and insulting initiatives will likewise be removed, and they will no longer be in command. They’re going to be gone. Gone so fast. Kamala and crooked Joe purged 8,000 service members from our military for refusing their COVID vaccine mandate. They refused to do it. We didn’t want a mandate. The mandate, you just can’t do that. I will rehire every patriot who was fired from the military with an apology and with back pay. They will get their back pay and an apology from our government. Hopefully they have great jobs right now and they’re making a lot of money. But if they want to come back in, they get an apology and we sign them up and they get their back pay. Should have never happened. The mandate stuff should have never happened.
(02:03:44)
Thanks to comrade Kamala and Joe Biden, morale in our military is now so low that almost every single branch is suffering a major recruitment and retention crisis. You know that? Upon taking office, I will begin the largest peacetime recruitment drive in the history of the Armed Forces. We have to fill our armed forces with great people, but they don’t have spirit now. There’s no spirit. Used to bring other soldiers would bring their friends in. Now that doesn’t happen, almost never happens. The sense of spirit, pride and prestige will soon come roaring back and reach levels never seen before. We’re going to make it so hot that I’m going to want to resign and join the military. I don’t know what rank I would start at. I guess I start at private, I don’t know. What rank would I have to start at, General? I have to start pretty low. He said, “You’ll start at the top.” All right, then I’ll stay here. That’s very good. “You’ll start at the top.” He knows what to say.
(02:04:45)
America’s military must always be unrivaled and unbeatable. I mean, I see reports coming out where they do studies, and they said under these circumstances we’ll lose a war to China. Number one, if it’s true, why are we saying it? And number two, it shouldn’t be true, should it? Shouldn’t be true, not going to happen. Why would they release a report like that for China to read?

Speaker 1 (02:05:09):

They’re idiots.

Donald Trump (02:05:10):

We’re vulnerable here. She said they’re idiots. That’s a good word. Who’s the woman that said that? Stand, please. Who said that? That’s very good. No, it’s true. She says they’re idiots now. They released a report talking about all of the vulnerable areas. “We need more this. We need more that we’re weak here, we’re weak there.” I don’t know who does this report. Why would you release a report like that?
(02:05:35)
So after years, that’s like saying we have no ammunition. “Ladies and gentlemen, we have no ammunition at the time. We’re the United States of America.” You know why? We gave it all up to Ukraine and various other places. We gave them everything. “Empty our warehouses of all of our ammunition. Let’s give it to people free of charge, free of charge, cost billions, free of charge.” Everything’s always free of charge.
(02:05:57)
So, after years of horrific depletion with the comrade sending our missiles and airplanes, ammunition to other countries, I will make an historic investment in rebuilding the US Armed Forces. I did that once before, but I have to do it again because they’ve depleted it. Just like they’ve depleted the strategic oil reserves. In all due respect, it’s not for filling up your car so that you have 4 cents a gallon less and that you vote for crooked Joe. It’s not meant for that. It’s meant for war, it’s meant for tragedy, it’s meant for real stuff. It’s at the lowest point today in its history. We almost have nothing left. And we had it at a level that was such a beautiful thing to see. We will increase funding, but at the same time, the days of blank checks for the weapon systems over the past are over.
(02:06:52)
I tell you what we will build, though. We’re going to build a great iron dome over our country so that we don’t have to get hit. We give it to other countries. We help Israel and other countries. And Ronald Reagan wanted it many years ago, as you know, but we didn’t really have the technology then. He was right, but we didn’t have the right tech. Today, we have unbelievable technology and we have other countries that have it. This country should have it, and we’re going to make it right here and we’re going to make it in other of our great places. But a lot of it’s going to come right out of your state.
(02:07:27)
It’s time to create the arsenal of the 21st century. We need that. That means aggressively shifting funding to keep America on the cutting edge, investing heavily in drones and robotics and artificial intelligence and hypersonics. Do you know hypersonics? These are missiles that go seven times faster than a fast ordinary missile, seven times faster. So fast that, for the most part, you can’t shut them down and you can’t shoot them down. They’re going at levels of speed that nobody thought was possible. Do you know? That was our technology that was stolen by Russia, and Russia has them, and I started them very quickly. But somebody gave Russia, years ago before me, all of our plans and specs for hypersonic missiles, and they built them and we didn’t.

Speaker 2 (02:08:22):

Bill Clinton.

Donald Trump (02:08:23):

He said Bill Clinton, it could be. It might have been, in all fairness, might’ve been a little after Bill Clinton. I used to like Bill Clinton. Can you believe it?

Speaker 2 (02:08:31):

Obama.

Donald Trump (02:08:33):

It could have been Barack Hussein Obama, perhaps we should ask him. Now, he was very nasty last night. I try and be nice to people, but it’s a little tough when they get personal. “Please,” again, remember? “Please, sir, don’t get personal talk about policy.” Let me ask you about that. We’re going to do a free poll. Here are the two questions: should I get personal, should I not get personal? Ready? Should I get personal? Should I not get personal? I don’t know, my advisors are fired. No. We’d rather keep it on policy, but sometimes it’s hard when you’re attacked from all ends.
(02:09:18)
I mean, they want to put you in jail for nothing, for nothing. For cases that the legal scholars all over the country have said there is no case, and they want to put you in jail. And I could have done that to Hillary Clinton. I could have put her in jail. She turned away subpoenas and she damaged stuff and she wouldn’t give things. After a subpoena was sent, after, from the United States Congress, I said to myself, “We want to bring the country together. Wouldn’t it be terrible to put the wife of the President of the United States in jail? Wouldn’t it be terrible?” And then I come out and they do it to me, and there’s no feeling as, ” Wouldn’t it be terrible?”
(02:10:02)
But we won the big case in Florida, that was totally won, and Biden didn’t. Biden documents I had the Presidential Records Act, I had a right to do whatever I wanted to do. That was passed in 1978. But Biden didn’t have a right to do because he wasn’t president, and he was there for 50 years he took stuff. And the ruling was, basically, he’s guilty as hell, but he’s got no memory. He’s a nice man with no memory. Actually they’re wrong. He’s not a nice man and he has no memory. He’s not a nice man at all, because he started weaponization. And weaponization is a double-prong that can come back to haunt them too. It’s a terrible thing for our country, I can tell you. A terrible thing for our country.
(02:10:54)
We need a dramatic increase in research. We need a very dramatic increase in development and in so doing, we will create countless American jobs, including jobs right here in a place called North Carolina. Do we love North Carolina? Laura Trump is from North Carolina. She named her daughter Carolina, the wife of Eric. I now say that he’s the husband of Laura. We changed it. He’s great. He’s great and it’s a great couple, but she loves this place. She just loves it. She’s here all the time, and she comes and we love her too. She she’s amazing. She’s got a great talent, and she, along with Michael Watley, are running the Republican National Committee and doing a great job.
(02:11:51)
A lot of times when you do that, they’ll say, “Oh, family,” let me tell you, this is not a job that someone, this is a tough job, and our primary focus is not to get out to vote, it’s to make sure they don’t cheat, because we have all the votes you need. You can see it, every house along the way has signs, “Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump-Vance, Trump-Vance.” And by the way, Vance is doing a great job. Vance doing a great job. Look at that beautiful red Vance. No, but these signs are all over the place. I see it everywhere no matter where, in Florida, they’re all over because people want to see common sense. We’re the party of common sense, it’s not conservative, liberal. They don’t want to be called liberal, they want to use progressive. “We’re progressive. Progressive.” I think liberal is more appropriate. Progressive’s, such a beautiful word, right? Progressive. Progressive means go forward. They don’t go forward, they go backward.
(02:12:44)
As we rapidly rebuild American deterrence, we will quickly restore peace and stability in our country, but all over the world. We will make our country a much safer place. We’re in grave danger of a war, a third world war, I tell you. Before I even arrive at the Oval Office and, as I said, we’re going to do things that are going to be shocking to people, but what I’m going to do more than anything else, I’m going to get things in line and we’re going to prevent that World War Three. And if you look at what’s going on with Ukraine and Russia, if you look at on now there’s an incursion into Russia, then there’ll be another incursion the other way, and then all of a sudden bad things will start to happen. They’re already starting.
(02:13:26)
By contrast, if comrade Kamala wins this November, World War Three is virtually guaranteed to happen. Everything she touches, she destroys. Everything that she’s touched, you look at her life, she was district attorney in San Francisco, the place went to hell. It was the best city in the world, probably 15, 18 years ago, 20 years ago, maybe in the whole world. It was one of the best cities in the world. Then she becomes the attorney general of the State of California. That place went to hell. It was helped by Gavin Newscomb. It was helped. Newscomb helped, but she was terrible, and it’s crime ridden. I mean, you can’t walk down the sidewalk anymore. It’s just unbelievable what’s happened to that state. So sad. Best weather, beautiful ocean, beautiful. Everything is good, but they’ve just let it go to hell, and she’s going to do the same thing to the United States.
(02:14:25)
And when she says, “I’ll let you frack,” her whole career, she said, “No fracking.” Pennsylvania in particular, because they get tremendous wealth from fracking, they’re going to be stopped. 100%, they’re going to be stopped. She just changed her view a few months ago. You’ve got to see, she ran against Biden. There were 22 people running. She was the first to leave. She quit because she went down like that. And she was the first one out. She never made it to the first state in the primary. She never made it to Iowa, never made it to Iowa. She didn’t get one vote and she still hasn’t gotten one vote, and she won’t have one vote.
(02:15:07)
Think of it. Biden, I’m not a fan of Biden. I think he was terrible. A terrible president. What he did to our country. You’d look at him with the planes and the stairs and the falling all over the place, and he had no idea what the hell was happening. He couldn’t find his way off a stage. A stare here, stare there, stares all over the place. He’d finish his speech and look around, “Where am I?” His speech has lasted, the nice part, it was good in the hot sun because they lasted for about two minutes and he could go home, but nobody would come anyway.
(02:15:42)
But we can’t let her, she’s much worse, much worse than him, actually, because she’s actually more radical. He never believed it. He just did it for votes. I don’t know why you’d get votes by having open borders. She wants open borders. If she became president, in four years you’d have 60 to 70 million people from all over the world. And it’s not just South America. And remember, they’re releasing them from their jails and their prisons. They’re coming out of jails and prisons and mental institutions and insane asylums. Then we have hundreds and probably thousands of terrorists that have come into our country. We probably have a few here. Welcome, welcome. But we probably have a few here. And she’s all for it. And now she’s saying, and you see what she’s saying. Well, the wall was largely built. We were adding space onto the wall. We built hundreds of miles of wall. I actually took it because Congress gave us a hard time and the Democrats were brutal. We had 11 lawsuits and we won all 11. But I took it out of the military. I called it an invasion of our country. It was an invasion. And we built hundreds of miles of wall and then I was going to do 200 extra. We ordered it, it was there, and we had that rotten, horrible election, that horrible election where we did much better than we did the first time, and bad things happened. And all of a sudden I hear that they want to have open borders, and I thought they were kidding. Who the hell wants open borders?
(02:17:18)
And then they said, “We’ll give you healthcare.” Now, they’re saying all about how they’re getting tough in the borders and how they were tough, except they have a couple of problems. Do you know that we flew in a million people, airplanes over the top of the border, beautiful airplanes, they’re flying them in. If you want to stop people, you’re not flying them in on airplanes and many other things. No, they wanted open borders. And we have a country that’s loaded up with many, many criminals right now, of the worst. They emptied their jails. They emptied their jails and prisons. They emptied their mental institutions into our country, largely.
(02:17:56)
Now, they’re continuing to do it, but if you look at many of these countries that we’re talking about, frankly, who can blame them? They’re dropping their prisoners into the United States of America. They’re dropping all of these people into the United States, including their mental institution people. Any terrorist they have, they’re dropping them into the United States. We’re taking hundreds of thousands of people that were in jail for murder.
(02:18:23)
You take a look at Venezuela, their jails are half, and I’m surprised half because frankly I would have worked faster than that if I were running it. I would’ve had all of them out of there by now. They go to Caracas, they take all their gang members, all of their killers, their murders, they’re drug dealers. They take them and they’re putting them into the United States and their crime is down 72%. In fact, next time, what we’ll do instead of North Carolina, we’ll have our next little gathering in Venezuela because it will be much safer than being in our country. If these people win, you’re not going to have any meetings, you’re not going to have anything. There’ll be chaos in our country. And we just can’t let it happen. We can’t let it happen. We can’t let it happen.
(02:19:07)
Remember when Biden sent Kamala to Europe to stop the war in Ukraine, she met with Putin, and then three days later he attacked. How did she do? Do you think she did a good job? She met with Putin to tell him, “Don’t do it,” and three days later he attacked. That’s when the attack started. Did you know that, General? Should have sent you, but over a half a million they say are dead or wounded, but it’s a much higher number than that, and everything lies in ruin.
(02:19:38)
Look, we are going to fight like hell to win this election. They are going to cheat like hell to win the election because they have no bounds. They have no bounds. I’ve said to some Republicans once, in a place called Philadelphia, which I love. I went to school in Philadelphia. But it’s suffering tremendously like Chicago, like every Democrat-run city is suffering. But I said like, “Why do we allow them to do it? Do Republicans do what they do with the stuffing the boxes, with all of the different things they do?” “Sir, we’re proud Americans.” And that’s really the right thing to say, but they have no bounds. We have to win this election. If we don’t win this election, we are in such trouble as a country. We’re in trouble right now. But you have the right guy to straighten out, I’ll get it straightened out. I’ll get it straightened out fast.
(02:20:40)
We’re going to have peace through strength all over the world like we had just a short while ago. And I just want to say closing, it’s an honor to have served for four years. I wish we didn’t have this break. The only thing good about the break is it shows how bad it can get, because we’ve never had a country that’s been in shape like this country is in right now. We have squalor in our streets. Our vets are disregarded, living on sidewalks and freezing cold in unbelievably hot cities all over the country, and yet we have people coming in to our country that are living in luxury hotels. This is what we have. We’re going to straighten out our country through common sense. We’re going to straighten out our country. We’re the United States of America. We’re the greatest country in the world.
(02:21:35)
We’re not going to let this continue to go. We’re going to straighten it out. We’re going to make it bigger, better, stronger than ever before. We’re going to bring in business. We’re going to use tariffs to take advantage of our great strength, and to, frankly, hurt countries that are hurting us and have been hurting us on trade for many, many years.
(02:21:57)
Right now, China is building massive auto plants in Mexico, and they think that those plants are going to make cars and they’re going to sell them across the line for no tax, no anything, destroy what’s left in Detroit, which frankly compared to years ago is very little. And South Carolina and many other places, we’re not going to let it happen. We will charge them 150% or 200% tariff, and all of that investment that they made is now worthless. We’re not going to let them do that. We’re not going to let them destroy our automobile industry.
(02:22:31)
The United Auto Workers has a grossly incompetent man at the head. They want to make all electric cars. And Elon Musk is a friend of mine, you saw he endorsed me very strongly, and he understands that I’m right. And I love electric cars, they have an incredible purpose. They have an incredible purpose. They’re unbelievable what they can do, and he makes a great product. But I told him, I said, “Before you endorse, you have to understand we have to have gasoline-propelled cars.” Again, we have more liquid gold than anybody anywhere in the world, more than Saudi Arabia, more than Russia. We have more than anybody. We’re going to quadruple that business. We’re going to be much bigger than both of them put together.
(02:23:12)
We’re going to pay down debt. We’re going to reduce your taxes. I gave you the largest tax cut in history, the largest regulatory cut in history that created all of the jobs. And when Biden talks about jobs, by the way, because they lie so much, the jobs he created, almost all of them, almost 100%, people say more than 100% went to illegal aliens. The other, remember this, the numbers sound good because they’re called bounce back jobs. We had a pandemic. People were laid off, and then as soon … And this is common for ages, when a pandemic goes, you have bounce back, the businesses. And had we not done what we did with money, probably some of you benefited, but we would have been in a 1929 style depression. We did it just right.
(02:24:02)
The problem is they came in. They no longer needed money. We gave them a country that was fixed. And more people died during Biden, think of that, than died during us from COVID. Many more people died during them. But think of this, we gave them a country and they blew it because they took so much. They took trillions and trillions of money, they kept feeding it, and that’s what caused, along with their bad energy policies, that’s what caused this tremendous inflation, which is destroying the people of our country. And frankly, it’s contagious. It’s all over the world, but we’re the ones that started it with their bad policy.
(02:24:42)
So we’re going to work very hard. We’ve got to win. We’ve got to win this state. This state is a very, very big state to win. We’ve won it twice, and we’re going to win it again.
(02:24:56)
I said to a couple of the people, I said, “So, let me ask you, how are we doing compared to four years ago and eight years ago?” They said, “Sir, you’re much hotter. You’re more popular.” I hope that’s true. But we won it twice and all I can do is pledge to you that we are going to do a great job for North Carolina. We’re going to do a great job for the United States of America. We put America first, and we’re going to make America great again. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody.

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald J. Trump.

Donald Trump (06:50):

Nice place by the way. Incredible people outside. You saw the crowds, it was just incredible. And we really feel good about the state and the area. We’re doing very well here. Just got a poll that was very good. Got a lot of good polls the last couple of days. Thank you to the Livingston County Sheriff’s Department for welcoming us in such a beautiful way. This was a beautiful welcome, and these are great people. These are great people. And we have, in terms of law enforcement, just about every law enforcement group in the country has endorsed us, as you probably have heard. And there’s a reason for that, because I believe in law enforcement, the other group doesn’t.
(07:37)
It’s always an honor to be with our brave men and women in blue and in brown, frankly, and in various colors because it’s not always blue. But these are great people and you just don’t do better. They’re brave. They’re under assault and they have a lot of difficulty with the laws of our land, and we’re going to get rid of that difficulty because they shouldn’t have difficulty. Our police men and women have the backs of law-abiding citizens every single day. They take care of what they have to do in some very adverse conditions. And when we go back to the White House, you’re going to see support the likes of which you haven’t seen certainly in four years.
(08:23)
We worked very closely with the police all over the country, as you know, gave them billions of dollars of excess military equipment that was in warehouses all over the country that the Obama administration refused to give. And it was just drawing dust. Magnificent equipment, but it was just getting old, sitting in warehouses. And I hope you guys got some of it, did you? Because I gave it, and it was billions and billions and it was nothing going to happen, whether it, except the government was paying lots of rents all over the country for big warehouses. And it was an honor to have done it and it helped a lot of the departments very, very much.
(09:02)
I want to thank Livingston County Sheriff Mike Murphy. Mike, thank you. Thank you. Where is he? Thank you, Mike. Thank you, Mike. What a great job. So respected, all of them. This group is highly respected. Mason County Sheriff Kim Cole. Kim, thank you. Van Buren County Sheriff Daniel Abbott. Thank you, Daniel. President of the Police Officer’s Association of Michigan, James Tignanelli. James. Picking the wrong side. Where he is? Where are you? Come on over here, James. Let’s go, get over here. Come on. Is he allowed to stand with you guys? I don’t know. Stand up there, James. How are you? Thank you, James.

Representatives. John James and John Moolenaar, these are great warrior people. Wherever you are. Where’s John James? There they… Oh, look at you guys.

Your next US senator, he’s really working hard and I just saw a poll, doing very well, Mike Rogers. Mike. Thank you, Mike. Congressional Candidate Paul Young, who is polling beautifully, I think. Paul, good luck. Good luck, Paul. You’re going to do it. And Michigan House Republican leader, Matt Hall. Matt, thanks. Oh, thanks Matt. Great. You look the role, Matt. Beautiful. Thank you very much, Matt.

Speaker X (10:51):

[inaudible 00:10:52].

Donald Trump (10:52):

You’re right. That’ll be next. Thank you very much. Michigan Senate Republican leader, Aric Nesbitt. Aric. Thank you, Aric. Nice seeing you again. Doing a good job. We’re here today to talk about how we are going to stop the Kamala crime wave that is going on at levels that nobody’s ever seen before. And she is, as you know, the most radical left person ever even thought of for high office, certainly for the office of president. People don’t know the real Kamala, but I do. And people that do what I do, they also know. But she is so far left that nobody can even imagine and her real thoughts are there.
(11:42)
They call her a flip flopper at the highest level that they’ve ever seen in politics because she’s come out with policy for years, defund the police. You don’t mind defunding, do you fellas? Would you vote for a defunder? By the way, the people that you protect don’t want defunders either, but she’s been that until just recently, but she’s always been for defunding the police. And the person that she’s running with, Tim Walz, is equally far left. This is the most far left group. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it, and the press is giving them a free pass. And if it was up to them, you wouldn’t even have the men behind me, people behind me, representatives behind me. You wouldn’t have them. They wouldn’t have a job. They think it’s going to just police itself. Everything’s going to take care of itself.
(12:41)
Her father is, as you know, a Marxist professor, and he obviously did a good job, but this is where she’s coming from. And you see her now with a smile, and she’s gotten rid of the laugh over the last couple of days. I don’t know. I haven’t seen her laugh. They’ve told her, “Don’t laugh, please.” But I’ll bet inside she was laughing last night when she saw the way Joe Biden left because that was a coup. That was a coup. And I’m no fan of his at all. And it started with the debate, and from that point on, it just got worse and worse. But that was a coup. It was a vicious, violent overthrow of a president of the United States.
(13:20)
Since Comrade Kamala Harris took office, her administration’s crime statistics show she’s presided over a 43% increase in violent crime. These are all government numbers. 43% increase in violent crime. I’ll bet the people behind me don’t have anything like that. It just gets better. It doesn’t get worse. Including a 58% increase in rape, 89% increase in aggravated assault and a 56% increase in robbery. The crime in America, the fact is is out of control. I watched last night in amazement as they tried to pretend that everything was great, the crime was great, the border was great, there wasn’t a problem at all. No inflation, no nothing.
(14:11)
There has been a report that the job numbers over the last period of time were fraudulent. And I understand that because I know how the job numbers go. And you want to be a bad person in high office you can be a bad person, but the numbers are going to be revised that the job numbers were far less at nobody’s ever seen. 600,000 to a million jobs less. And let’s see if that turns out to be true, but that’s what the rumor is. It was reported by a very respected outfit, group, and we’ll see what happens. But that’s a terrible insult to our economy because we were seeing numbers that were okay, not great, but now we’re seeing numbers that when they’re adjusted are a disaster.
(15:07)
But crime in America is out of control. I’m going to make it, along with the economy, inflation, strong borders and energy dominance, my top priority. I’m including crime in America. Normally, that’s done locally. And we’re going to give the local people a lot of help, like I did initially, but not that much. We had a lot of great numbers coming out when I was president. Now, we’re seeing numbers that are just absolutely horrific. The Democrats are holding their convention in Chicago in order to showcase it. And yet, as you know, on 4th of July weekend, 117 people were shot. Of the 117, 17 were killed. This is 4th of July weekend. And 40 were shot last weekend.

Donald Trump (16:00):

I don’t know how many were killed, but assume a lot. And that’s a war zone that’s worse than Afghanistan that we read about all the time. Speaking of Afghanistan, the worst and most embarrassing day in the history of our country, in my opinion, we left 13 dead soldiers, 47 obliterated, just obliterated the arms, the legs to face, left people behind, and we left $85 billion worth of equipment behind for the Taliban to use as it sees fit. And they’re selling a lot of it because they don’t need 700,000 guns and rifles. They don’t need 72,000 armor plated vehicles. They’re one of the largest sellers of military equipment in the world right now. They’re selling our equipment because they said, by the way, would’ve never happened with me. Abdul would never have done that, but they said we didn’t have anybody shot. After my conversations with the leader of the Taliban, zero shot in 18 months.
(17:07)
We had nobody lost in 18 months. He knew that he was not going to do that. I knew that. But now you look at what’s happened and it’s back, we would’ve kept Bagram. That’s the big air base, not because of Afghanistan, but because it’s located one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons. So it’s one hour away and we had it one of the biggest air bases in the world. We built it for billions and billions of dollars many years ago. Got the biggest runways, the biggest everything, and we just walked away from it, gave it to them, and now China’s occupying it, and I thought that the scene a few days ago of the third anniversary, they call it the Defeat of America, was one of the ugliest scenes that I’ve seen on television in a long time. I’ve seen some pretty bad ones. So have you, we’re witnessing some pretty bad ones.
(18:04)
They had a parade where the parade was all of our equipment, a lot of our equipment, brand new beautiful armor plated trucks coming down a road and people cheering. Not that many people cheering actually, but there were people cheering, but they were making us look very bad. We have a fool, a fool as a president. They lied last night about things that nobody’s ever seen. They lied about soldiers at a grave site. They lied about Charlottesville, they lied about inflation. The inflation’s been absolutely horrible, absolutely horrible, and everyone knows that we had virtually no inflation. They had 9%, but that wasn’t including some of the things that went up more than anything else. They gave themselves a pass. But mothers will no longer be losing their children because of weak liberal policies and politicians that have given up on securing a crime free America. We want a crime free America.
(19:16)
We’re going to stop violent crime in the United States, and it’s people like this that can do the job better than anybody. They do the job justly and fairly, but there’s nobody like these people. Thank you. Thank you. There’s nobody like them, so they can do it. They have to be given back their rights and their dignity. They have to be allowed to do their job. We’re going to be guaranteeing immunities, and I’m not looking necessarily just here, but we have police in various areas that are pretty rough areas. If they do their job, if they’re diligent in doing their job, they go after the police officer rather than the criminal. They lose their house, they lose their pension, they lose their family, they lose everything. They lose everything. Then we’re going to make sure that doesn’t happen. Over the past four years, the Marxist left has waged a vicious war on law enforcement in our country.
(20:25)
They’ve taken away the dignity and the spirit and the life of some of these police officers, and that’s why you see it. The crime is so out of control in our country. I mean, you have cities, I will say this, the top 25 almost all are run by Democrats and they have very similar policies. It’s just insane. But you can’t walk across the street to get a loaf of bread. You get shot, you get mugged, you get raped, you get whatever it may be, and you’ve seen it and I’ve seen it, and it’s time for a change. We have to bring back our cities. We have these cities that are great cities where people are afraid to live in America. They’re fleeing the cities of our country. What we would consider, what we did consider, interestingly like New York when I left for Washington, New York was we had a very bad Mayor de Blasio, but he wasn’t there that long and he couldn’t ruin what took place.
(21:25)
But we had a city that was so wonderful and so thriving, and just in a few short years that change, New York state is doing terribly. I heard the governor last night speaking so viciously and violently about me, but she doesn’t speak about what they’ve done to destroy the state. The law enforcement has been decimated. The judges, what’s gone on with the judges in New York? Nobody… There’s no justice. We’re not getting justice in New York. And yet she speaks so bravely about things that she shouldn’t be speaking about. But you look at radical liberal Kamala Harris, she’s been the ringleader for this anti-crime and the anti-police crusade. It’s a real anti-police crusade.
(22:20)
They just have it out for the police. Nobody knows why. I don’t understand why from a common sense. I like to say the Republican Party is now the party of common sense. Conservative, yeah, I guess conservative. It doesn’t matter. It’s the party of common sense. We want to have borders. We want have strong police protection. We want a military that can protect us. We want great school, school choice ideally. We want have a good life. We want to be safe. But let’s review Kamala’s pro crime, anti-police record. She repeatedly endorsed defunding the police, which I said, and it said a level, and it never goes away. When you’re a defunder or when you are even a politician, your first thought usually is the thought that you go with. If she ever had a chance, she would do whatever she could to defund the police.
(23:22)
That’s where her spirit is. That’s where her heart is, and we can’t have a president like that. She sponsored a bill to strip police officers of legal protection leaving you at the mercy of the lawless Marxist prosecutors who want to lock up police officers for sport. They lock them up in many cases long before they lock up the criminal and they go after them too violently. They don’t go after the criminals. Murderers are released two hours after the murder. She wants to bankrupt the police unions. She wants to destroy policemen in general, and they ruin your lives, your jobs, and they ruin everything you’ve lived for, everything you’ve felt that you want to make great. You want to make our country great. When I’m President of the United States, again, we will never even think about or mention the words defund the police. We’ll never think about that again. It’s got to be put away. It’s a bad situation. It’s a bad concept. The concept is so chilling and so horrible to think that what we should be thinking about is the opposite of defunding, refunding you called. We’ll refund, but we want to help the police. They have a very dangerous job lately. I see if somebody, I was with a great family a few months ago, opens the door to a car and gets shot and they have all sorts of protection for the people in the car. You can’t have your gun even close to being drawn. You don’t know what’s happening. A lot of the windows are dark, so you don’t know who’s in there, but the door opens and just gets shot. Great police officer and many, many cases. It’s a dangerous business and we have to give them protection and we have to give them love and respect, and that’s what we’re going to do.
(25:27)
We were doing it and they’re not doing it now. We’ll give our law enforcement heroes the kind of protection and the resources that they so dearly deserve, and I will crack down on local Marxist DAs who refuse to enforce the law. They refuse to put murderers in jail, and you see it all over as the district attorney of San Francisco. Kamala Harris was one of the worst and one of the first Marxist prosecutors in America. She said that, and some people said she was the godmother of both sanctuary cities because this was a while ago. This was when it all started, and that horrible shoplifting epidemic. She shielded illegal alien crack dealers from deportation. She fought like hell to have crack dealers not deported. She came up with a concept of $950 and below. You don’t even get prosecuted. $950, so guys are walking into stores with calculators to figure out, do you know that they have calculators?
(26:42)
They adding it up. They want to make sure they’re under 950, but it didn’t matter because they didn’t prosecute the ones that went over either. She ignored the pleas of victims, families members and refused to seek the death penalty against, as an example, an illegal alien, MS 13 gang member, these are the worst gangs in the world who murdered an innocent man and his two sons were absolutely no reason. They said, “Why did you do it?” He said, “I felt like it. I felt like it.” So when Kamala, until recently was called a Marxist prosecutor, she didn’t even disclaim the title. She sort of liked it. As the California Attorney General, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon and rape of an unconscious person as a nonviolent crime. All of them were redefined by her as nonviolent. Kamala Harris supports abolishing cash bail nationwide.
(27:45)
Cash bail has been a disaster. When you abolish the no cash, no cash, don’t worry about cash, you murdered somebody, don’t worry about it. That was really the beginning of problems for New York. Big problems for New York, but elsewhere also. But it means releasing violent criminals immediately after arrest. No money involved. Don’t worry about it. Go home. Enjoy yourself. Many of them disappear. You never find them again. Many of them immediately start killing again. It’s just a crazy situation. She supports ending jail sentences for parole violators. She considers a parole violation not to be serious. One, the violent mobs of looters and anarchists tried to burn down Minneapolis in 2020. Kamala Harris raised money, bailed to bail out the arsonists and the riders and the killers. People were killed. Many people were killed. Compare that to J6. Nobody was killed. Nobody was killed. There weren’t fires set.
(28:53)
They burned down the city. They were burning down Minneapolis, and she went out and not only did she work a little bit with them, she worked a lot with them. She worked to get them out and to set them free. One of the criminals Kamala helped bail out of jail was Shawn Michael Tillman, one of the worst, a dangerous repeat offender. Had a horrible record of violence. With Kamala’s help, she was set free. He was set free. Soon, went on to murder a man on a train platform for no reason whatsoever in St. Paul, shooting him six times in the head and in the torso. No reason whatsoever. What’s the reason? No reason, just felt like it. Kamala Harris will deliver crime, chaos, destruction and death. If she’s allowed to be the President of the United States you’ll see levels of crime that you’ve never seen before.
(29:55)
I will deliver law, order, safety and peace, and I will protect those who protect us. These people protect us. These are unbelievable people. They protect us. We have to protect them. We have to give them hope because so many are leaving the forces. I can’t speak for this group because I’d love to work for them. I would be joining them in two minutes. It looks like a nice job there. So they look because they’ve handled themselves and crime and everything else in a stern way, and it’s probably a lot easier to do. Maybe we should switch them around to different territories of your state, of our nation and let some other guys take… Would you like that fellers, I have a feeling you don’t want that? I don’t want to embarrass you. I don’t want to say any particular names of locations, but I can think of a big one in the state.
(30:52)
I’d love to have them working there during the election, I can tell you, but no, but they have it all very much under control, and that’s the way it should be. So we’re going to make a record investment in hiring, retention, and training of police officers. We’re losing tremendous numbers of police officers. These are men and women that want to be police officers and they’re just leaving. We’re going to get you reinforcements and we’re not going to be doing the negative. Let’s pay them much less or let’s defund entirely. Let’s pay them. There’s a movement on now. We won’t defund, but we’ll pay them much less money. No. I’ve never realized how dangerous a job it was. I have some papers here where if you watch the event last night, this is by the way, my all time favorite chart, which is because if you’ve watched last night, you wouldn’t know that border was so bad. This was right here, this arrow on the bottom, lowest ever. This is made by border

Donald Trump (32:00):

… border patrol. That’s the lowest ever we had for illegal aliens coming into our country. And that was the week I left office. That’s the lowest ever. Now, this chart is very dear to my heart for another reason. This was the chart. I said, “Let me see. Let me see it.” But it says a lot, and we had a couple of instances last night where things were mentioned so I got it. Did crime rise under Trump and fall under Biden? They said it rose under Trump. And they go, “No, the opposite is true.” Take a look at this here. It said, “Is it true, did crime rise under Trump and fall under Biden?” “No, the opposite is true.” This was a study group that went out and doesn’t care. They do the numbers.
(32:54)
And there was another one that a historical comparison of the collapse of law enforcement in U.S. cities. The drop in arrest rates over the last few years is without precedent, lowest arrest rates we’ve ever seen. They don’t arrest people anymore. And they shouldn’t arrest people for saying the election was rigged, but they liked that. They go after guys like me, but they don’t go after people that kill people. It’s a shame what’s happened in our country. But we’re going to turn it around. We’re going to win big and we’re going to turn it around. We’re going to turn it around fast. Thank you. Thank you. We’ll bust up and dismantle the gangs, savage criminal networks and bloodthirsty cartels, and we will stop the Fentanyl and we’ll make sure that Kamala Harris has, and all of the people that she’s allowed to come across the border… Don’t forget she was the border czar, whether she wants to hear it or not.

Speaker 3 (33:59):

Still is.

Donald Trump (34:00):

She still is. Thank you. In fact, you could do it right now. They like to talk, it’s all nonsense, that Donald Trump stopped a bill. I was opposed to it. So was everyone else. It was the weakest bill. Under that bill, millions of people would’ve been allowed to come in. This was a weak bill. But you didn’t need a bill. I didn’t have a bill. I said, “Close the border.” And that’s how we got to those numbers, the lowest ever recorded. I said, “Close the border.” I didn’t have a bill. I didn’t need a bill. She doesn’t need a bill. Biden doesn’t know where he is, so… Where is he? Whatever happened to him? He got out. He got out. He’s now sunbathing. He’s in a beach someplace.
(34:39)
But all he would have to do as president or her is say, close up the border and it’s closed. But they don’t want to close the border because when they first took over, I had built hundreds of miles of wall and I had 200 miles of wall in addition to what I said I was going to do because certain areas needed it. As we closed areas, other areas became very, very strong in terms of people wanting to come through. So I bought 200 additional miles. It would’ve taken about three weeks to erect it. We’re all set to erect it, then we had a terrible election take place, terrible election. And everybody here knows that.
(35:20)
And I realized that they don’t want to do it. And they actually sold that. And that was designed to the highest specifications of when you look at the steel, it’s steel, it’s concrete, 5,000 pound concrete inside and then rebar. And it also has a lot of technology wires and things in it for high technology. It was designed to the highest specs of the border patrol.
(35:43)
I wanted actually concrete plank. I would’ve done a beautiful job with precast like you have in parking garages, long span. It’s called long span precast. But they had to be able to see through. I understand that. They needed certain things that you can’t do with concrete plank. So we did that, and very expensive to do because you needed all sorts… In other words, they wanted the steel, they wanted the concrete. It’s all different methods of very hard to cut it, very hard to do it when you have different substances. And then very powerful rebar inside.
(36:15)
And what happened is, as soon as they came in, they sold it for 5 cents on the dollar. They sold this stuff. Somebody made a lot of money because that steel is very valuable. But they sold all of that hundreds of miles of stuff. You saw it stacked up for a long period of time where they stacked it up in an area because Texas wanted to use it and finish the job. We built hundreds of miles. But Texas wanted it. They would’ve paid for it. They refused to sell it to Texas. They refused to sell it to Arizona. And they refused to sell it to anybody. They sold it to the junkyards, I guess, and 5 cents on the dollar.
(36:57)
On day one, I will seal the border. I will stop the invasion. We had the border sealed. I had Mexico, I had thousands of soldiers from Mexico, free of charge. I said to the president, “You must give us soldiers because they’re coming through. The caravans are coming through your country.” “No, no, no, I cannot do that.” I said, “Yes, you’ll do that. If you don’t do that, I’m going to put tariffs on your cars.” And he said, “I will do that, sir.” And he did it. He did it very quickly.
(37:22)
And it really, you guys heard all about it, made a great difference. We had thousands of Mexican soldiers guarding our borders that, look, they’re coming through your country. You have to guard your southern border, which is their border on the other side. And all of a sudden they started and we had it… We had remain in Mexico. It’s called Remain in Mexico policy, which we never had. And they stayed in Tijuana, different places, hundreds of thousands of people that didn’t come into our country until they were checked. And then if they were good, we let them in. And if they weren’t, we wouldn’t let them in.
(37:52)
And we worked well with Mexico, actually. But now Mexico has really taken advantage of our country. They want billions of dollars just to talk. They wouldn’t say that with me. They wanted, I think $2 billion to talk, right? “We will talk. We want $2 billion before we even start.” That wouldn’t happen with me. I would say, “Oh really? Is that right? That’s the end of trade with Mexico.” And they would say, “Sir, we will give you two billion. How about that?”
(38:23)
So I’ll send Kamala’s illegal aliens back home where they belong. We have a problem because when I came in, they wouldn’t accept MS-13 gang members. I told the generals we’re going to get the gang members out. ICE and border patrol, the job these people do. But ICE would go into the country, get the MS-13 gang members out, the meanest, the most vicious. They kill people with knives. They killed two young students walking to school, two beautiful, young sixteen-year-old girls walking to school. They killed them up and chopped them up into pieces with knives dead.
(38:58)
And ICE goes in and they go into those packs of rough, rough people and ICE is rougher than they are. These are incredible, brave patriots. A lot of people wouldn’t want that job. You see fists and feet, you see everything flying. And then two minutes later, they stand up and they grab them and they throw them into what they used to call a paddy wagon. They put them into planes, say, “Take them out.” The countries wouldn’t take them back under President Obama. And I said, “Really? They’re not going to take them back? Well, if they’re not going to take them back, I’m going to stop paying them.” I said, “How much money do we pay these countries, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and others?” I said, “How much money do we pay?” $750 million. I said, “Good. Inform them we’re not paying them anymore.”
(39:44)
And the following morning, I got calls from all of these countries. “Sir, sir, there must be a misunderstanding. We would love to take them back. We would love to have MS-13. We would love to have MS-13 back in our country. It would be a great honor to have them back.”
(40:00)
And before we get too far, we’re almost finished, but before we get too far, I want to tell you that we have criminals from all over the world pouring into our country right now. Your job will never be obsolete. It will never be obsolete, unfortunately. It’d be nice if we could have peace, but we’re not going to have peace. And this is something we’re going to have to live with for a long time.
(40:22)
She has allowed millions of people, open border, to flow into our country totally unchecked, totally unvetted. And they come from jails and prisons, slightly different. They come from mental institutions, all mental institutions all over the world. This isn’t just in South America. People think it’s South America. It’s from Africa, Asia, the Middle East. A lot of people coming from the Congo in Africa, the Congo, rough, rough, rough. And they’re prisoners. They’re prisoners. And we say, “Where do you come from?” “Africa.” “Where in Africa?” “Prison.” “What did you do?” “We don’t want to say.” They turn out to be murderers. These are rough people. And we’re allowing them into our country from all over the world. From South America, yes, but from all over the world. They come from insane asylums. And many are terrorists. So we have prisoners, mental patients, mental institution patients, terrorists pouring into our country totally unchecked, unvetted. We have some of the worst terrorists in the world. We know where they are approximately, but we don’t know too much. But we know they’re the worst. We have the worst terrorists in the world pouring into our country. And she’s the president and wants to be the President of the United States.
(41:50)
She’s vice president. She could do it. She’s in charge of the border. She could have closed up the border. She should have closed it up. They could have told Mexico, “If you don’t do it, we’re not going to do something.” We’re not going to have trade. We’re not going to deal with you. We’re not going to let you sell your cars into the United States at these ridiculous, where they took 32% of our car industry over many years. They took it out of Detroit. They took it out of different places. But they took it and they took it big from this state, from South Carolina, from a lot of different places. They took 32%. And I think now the number is bigger.
(42:26)
I don’t know if you know that they’re building some of the biggest car plants in the world right now in Mexico. Wouldn’t have happened with me. Right now in Mexico. And China’s the one building them, and they think they’re going to build, make these cars and then release them into the United States without tax. It’s not going to happen. We’ll put a hundred percent to a 200% tariff. We’re not going to let it happen, because all of our jobs from your state will be gone.
(42:52)
And I watched this union head, he’s an incompetent guy. He’s approving for what he did for what he’s allowed every job, every autoworker here will be out of a job within three years if I’m not elected, every autoworker in the state. They’re all going to be made in China. They’re going to an all-electric policy. Well, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any country in the world, but we don’t have for what you need for an electric car. But China does, and its territories do and we’re not going to let it happen. But they’re building some of the biggest plants.
(43:27)
And I have a friend who builds plants. He said, “Some of the biggest in the world,” I think he’s doing them, “are being built in Mexico.” And they’re going to sell cars, produce them, and sell them in this country with no taxes. It’s not going to happen. I told him, I said, “You better hope I don’t win.” Always dangerous to say these things. Maybe that’s why I get shot at and other people don’t, right, John James? That’s probably why I get shot at. Other people, they will protect other people because they can’t believe they got so lucky. But I have to do what I have to do. I have to do the right thing. The Border Czar Kamala Harris has allowed hordes of illegal alien criminals to literally stampede into our country. We’re going to end that on day one. We’re going to close our border. We’re going to get all of the bad ones out, and we’re going to get them out fast. In Shelby Township, Michigan, earlier this year, thirty-two-year-old, previously deported illegal alien, monster, was arrested for repeatedly sexually assaulting a young girl under the age of 13. Local law enforcement described the crimes as absolutely horrific and says he had many other victims, including death is involved. Death. Young girls.
(44:45)
In St. Joseph County, Michigan, an illegal alien was recently charged with breaking into a home and sexually assaulting two very little girls, very badly assaulting. In Mississippi, just days ago, an illegal alien child predator was charged with raping a ten-year-old boy. And there were other cases where they were raping ten-year-old boys and girls. And in many cases, they were dead. They were killed.
(45:14)
Last week, in Coney Island, two Kamala migrants were arrested for the rape of a forty-six-year-old woman, woman who was loved by so many people, throwing her to the ground and raping her over and over again, and then working her over with a knife to her throat. One of them had previously been arrested for raping another woman, but he was shielded from deportation by the New York City sanctuary laws, which Kamala strongly supports. She wants it very much. The woman said he didn’t want to rape me, he wanted to kill me. She thought she was dead. She survived, but she thought she was dead. She said he didn’t want to rape me, he wanted to kill me. This is what we’re allowing into our country.
(45:57)
And then you hear, “Oh no, the people coming in, they’re much less violent than the people…” That’s not right. They’re much more violent and that they make a hat. Sheriff, they make a hat, and I don’t want to brag, but it says Trump was right about everything. And if you look, whether it’s the border, this, I’ve been right about everything. Unfortunately. I wish I wasn’t.
(46:20)
So when I return to the White House, we will stop the plunder, rape, slaughter, and destruction of our American suburbs, our cities and towns. And I think that women living in the suburbs, I keep hearing about the suburban woman doesn’t like Trump. Well, I think it’s a fake poll because why wouldn’t they like me? I keep the suburbs safe. I stopped low-income towers from rising right alongside of their house, and I’m keeping the illegal aliens away from the suburbs. I think that they like me a lot. I think it’s a lot of fake polls.
(46:55)
We’ve seen a lot of fake polls over the years. I was not supposed to win anything, and we won the big one. We won it and did a lot better the second time than I did the first. But women want to have safety. They want to have a strong military. They want to have a strong police force. They want to be in their house and they want to be safe. They don’t want to have people pouring into their doors and you can’t do anything about it.
(47:21)
So I think that’s number one thing. I hope they like my personality. I have a nice personality. But to me it wouldn’t be very important, the personality. They want to be safe and they want people like this happy, and they want people like this taken care of properly because those are the people that keep them safe. So we’ll shut down all deadly sanctuary cities throughout the country because all they do is they shield criminals. They basically shield criminals from prosecution.
(47:52)
I will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement. We’re going to put a lot of immigration enforcement. We’re going to

Donald Trump (48:00):

… Close down the border day one. And we are going to… Just so you understand, I am not a radical at all. I’m just a common sense person that was successful in what I did because of the same thing. We are going to let people, and we want people, to come into our country. A lot of people, we need them. We need them for jobs. We need them for everything. We want people to come in, but they have to come in through a process. They have to come in legally. And we can let a lot of them come in, but John, we want them to come into our country legally. We don’t want to let people come in who murdered 19 people and then you hire that person in a plant and all of a sudden you notice that people are being killed all over town. We want them to come in legally.
(48:45)
On day one, we’ll begin the largest domestic deportation operation in the history of our country, bigger than Dwight Eisenhower. Dwight Eisenhower was very… He was sort of a moderate person, but he hated when people poured into our country and he was very strong on deportation. We will remove all criminal aliens immediately. All of the criminals. We start with that. We’re going to get them out of here fast. Nothing good is going to happen with thousands of terrorists being in our country.
(49:14)
We had one month where border patrol was actually… Does a chart, and I don’t believe this. I love it in a certain way, but I don’t… They said in 2019, zero terrorists came in. Now, I don’t believe that, but it’s an awfully good statistic. But it was very few that came in. We were very tough on that. We had everybody check so carefully and they added… Actually, in 2019, they had zero. Now, you have thousands of terrorists coming into our country. Thousands of terrorists. These are the people that blew up the World Trade Center. Bad things will happen. And if I’m elected, we’re going to get them the hell out of here and we’re going to get them out of here fast. Very fast. And I told you that other countries who really… They put their people into groups, they send them up here, and by the thousands. The caravans, I think it was the name that I came up with, I don’t know, maybe somebody will say “he’s lying about that, somebody else used the term 14 days earlier.” But we came up because it just seemed like an appropriate term. It’s a caravan of thousands of people. We have one caravan coming up right now, thousands of people that go right into the country. But I call these… They wouldn’t take the MS-13 people back or other criminals back. And the generals said, “we are just not able to do it, sir, because they won’t take them back.” They’d put planes on the runways so that you couldn’t land the plane. They’d block up the bus lanes so you couldn’t bring the buses and you couldn’t get them back.
(50:55)
And when I told them that they wouldn’t get any more money, I said, “let them know they’re delinquent, they broken the deal. We’re not going to get any more money.” We paid them, for years, hundreds of millions of dollars. The next morning, all three countries called me, like clockwork, separately. “Sir, is there a misunderstanding? I understand that perhaps you would like to talk to us.” I said, “yeah, you’re sending people into…” And they’re sending them, by the way. They don’t want them. They’re sending them. All of the countries are sending them, and now they’re coming in because of her, because she’s so pathetic and weak at the border. The worst job. The worst border czar in history. I can tell you that. Whether she’s a czar or just in charge of the border, it doesn’t matter. But they’re sending them in levels that we’ve never seen before and they’re destroying our country.
(51:43)
But they all said, all three, it was almost like identical conversations, it was, “sir, is there anything we can do to make up for this misunderstanding?” I said, “yep, you take your MS-13, and you take your gang members and you take your criminals and your drug dealers. We’re sending them back and we’re sending them back today.” And we sent thousands and thousands of people back. This has stopped for years. Under Bush, it stopped and under Obama it stopped. But this had been taking place for years, and I only found out about it, I said, “that’s good. Get them out.” I don’t want to put them in our jails because we put them in our jails, what are we going to do? Keep them for 50 years, 60 years? And the expense. The really bad ones, we did do that, though, however, because we don’t want them coming back.
(52:28)
But all of them said, “sir, we would be delighted to take MS-13 back. This would be a great honor. They’re such lovely people.” And we took them out by the thousands. We took MS-13. ICE took MS-13 out of our country by the thousands and thousands and they received them, and that’s the way. It’s just another little story, but it’s a story that’s very important because I can’t see a guy like Biden making that call. Do you think Biden thinks at night, “gee, how are we going to get MS-13 out?” He doesn’t know he’s alive. He didn’t know he’s alive. And this one is just a Marxist. She’s a Marxist, Communist person, and we’re not ready for a Communist president, okay? We’re not ready for it. We’re going to destroy our country. Under my leadership, no community will be surrendered to violent criminals. No citizen will be abandoned to migrant crime.
(53:20)
We have a new form of crime. It’s called migrant crime, and it’s probably more vicious than the crime that we already have, which is pretty vicious. These people are vicious. And please don’t let anyone convince you that our criminals, and we have more crime… They are sending massive number of criminals. And you’ve heard me say this before, Venezuela crime is down 72%. 72. Because they’ve taken their criminals out of Caracas, they’ve taken their criminals out of all of their cities, all of their areas, all over the country, and they’re sending them to us. And I’m amazed that they’re not doing it quicker, to be honest with you. It’s happening fast. They’re also emptying out the jails. And this is true all over the world. They’re emptying out their prisons and they’re taking their criminals off the streets. They’re taking their drug dealers and their crime rates are down at levels that nobody’s ever seen before.
(54:16)
And everyone says, “oh, so-and-so’s doing a great job running such-and-such a country.” No, they’re not. They’re just very intelligent. I would do it, if I were them. I would do it much faster. I can’t believe they still have some left. But their jails are getting to be very empty. And what they’re doing is they’re literally dropping them in. They’re busing them in and they’re bringing them in and they’re saying, “don’t ever come back. If you come back, you get the death penalty,” or “if you come back, you get killed. Don’t ever come back.”
(54:44)
And you see the crime statistics are unbelievable. If you look at the jails, the jails are… They’ve never been so low in… World. I’m talking all over the world because they’re sending their criminals to the United States of America and they’re saying, “don’t ever come back.” And their jails are being emptied and their criminals are being taken off the streets and their crime rates are plummeting. But that’s what we want for our country, so we’re sending those people back and these are the people that can do it.
(55:22)
We’re going to have a reformed Department of Justice. We’ll, once again, be a friend and partner to our great local police and police officers, general, and we’ll be working with victims of crime very closely, but we’ll not be working with the criminals that commit the crime. We’re going to change it around. Right now, the criminal has a lot more respect within our Department of Justice than the victims. We’re going to be working with the victims. We’re going to get the gangsters, the drug dealers, the dangerous offenders behind bars, and we’re going to get them ideally out of our country, ideally, except in extreme cases. We have some extreme cases where they’ve murdered many people. And in that case, we want to make sure they’re away.
(56:06)
But the amount of crime that we have is unbelievable and the lack of crime that these other places… It just makes so much sense, doesn’t it? That’s all common sense too. They’re taking their criminals and they’re bringing them to the United States and they look so great, and cities like Caracas, which was a very dangerous place to be, these are cities that have opened up, they have new life. But our country is suffering.
(56:33)
And they just got here over the last two years, mostly over the last couple of years, during this administration, during our great border czar who wants to be our president. They’ll be laughing. Watch President Xi, will be laughing. Putin will be laughing. They’ll all be laughing. By the way, the war with Russia would’ve never started with Ukraine, would’ve never started if I was President. October 7th would’ve never happened. Iran was broke. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for Hezbollah. This is a very dangerous time that we’re in. It’s dangerous in terms of crime and all, but it’s very dangerous in terms of a possible World War III.
(57:17)
We’re very close to World War III and people don’t realize it. We’re closer than we’ve ever been. I think ever since World War II. But this would be the war of wars because of weaponry. This isn’t, as I say, two army tanks going back and forth shooting at each other. The level of power, the level of weaponry that there is in the world today is so bad. It’s so dangerous. It’s so bad. And you need the right person to be President.
(57:43)
We had no war when I was President, except that I totally defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate. Everyone said it would take five years. It took me about four weeks because we have a great military. We have great generals. Not the ones you see on television, not the ones that did the Afghanistan botchery, but we have great military people. I know them, and they’re never going woke. You keep hearing our militaries going woke. The top people would like to see it, but it’s never going to… These are not people, just like these people will never be… Do you promise you’ll never be woke? I don’t see a lot of wokeness. There’s not a lot of wokeness.
(58:23)
I don’t think so. But we’re going to stand up for law-abiding citizens of America. We’re going to be really, I think, an inspiration to the world. But we have to start by remedying a situation that was caused by somebody that right now is running for President of the United States. She would be a disaster as President. I love our country. I didn’t need this. I didn’t have to do this. I didn’t need to get indicted by… Any time I fly over a state, they indict you. I got indicted more than the great Alphonse Capone, right? For nothing. My father’s looking down, my mother’s looking down. He was such a good boy. I don’t know what happened.
(59:09)
But I didn’t need this. I had a beautiful life. But to me, I wouldn’t change it for the world because we’re going to take this country, we’re going to make it safe again, and we’re going to make America great again. And I want to thank everybody for being here, and God bless you all. Thank you.

Donald J. Trump (04:25):

Thank you very much, Pennsylvania. I love Pennsylvania.

Crowd (04:29):

USA, USA.

Donald J. Trump (04:38):

Thank you very much. Thank you. I really give a very big hello to Pennsylvania. It’s great to be back in this beautiful Commonwealth with thousands of proud, hard-working American patriots, which is what you are. Think of this. Who would believe this? 80 days from now, we are going to defeat a communist known as Kamala Harris, the most radical left person ever to run for office. This is not what this country needs. We’ve had enough of them. We’re going to win back the White House and we’re going to take back our country. Kamala Harris is a super-left liberal who ruined San Francisco, ruined California and delivered a badly broken economy, a badly broken border, which gave us a dangerous world of chaos, death and destruction. Just take a look at what’s happening today. We were a respected country. Now the whole world laughs at us. We’re a bunch of foolish people to have allowed this to happen, but we’re going to bring it back. We’re going to bring it back very fast.
(05:57)
We’ll close up the borders. We’ll drill, baby drill. We’re going to do things that are going to be very good, very good, very fast. It’ll happen very quickly, but she breaks everything that she touches. But soon we’re going to fix every single problem Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, Crooked Joe have … what happened to Biden? I was running against Biden. All of a sudden I’m running against somebody else. It’s true. You know, it’s interesting. I said, “Who am I running against?” “Harris.” I said, “Who the hell is Harris?” “You don’t know. Who the hell is Harris?”
(06:33)
She was the first one out last time. She was the first one to lose, and now all of a sudden she’s running. She never got a vote. They are a threat to democracy, remember that. Starting the day I take the oath of office, I will rapidly drive prices down and we will make America affordable again. We’re going to make it affordable again. Under Kamala Harris and crooked Joe Biden, the American dream was dead and it is dead. It’s dead as a doornail. They’ll never bring it back unless we win. If we win, we’re going to have the American dream alive. All for your beautiful children, your grandchildren, we’ll have the American dream, will be back with us. Her radical liberal policies, of course, horrific inflation decimated the middle class and gutted the finances of millions of American families. And you know what I’m talking about because everybody in this room has been devastated by what they’ve done. They have no idea. They’re grossly incompetent people.
(07:44)
Real incomes are down by over $2,000 a year. Think of that. Minimum. And ours, up five times that amount, more than five times that amount. Her price hikes have cost a typical household a total of $28,000, and that’s called the Kamala Harris Inflation Tax. She was there for everything. You know when she sits and complains, hey, look, Joe Biden hates her, okay, hates her. You don’t mind if I go off teleprompter for a second, do you? Joe Biden hates her. This was an overthrow of a president. This was an overthrow. They went out and I spent a hundred million dollars fighting Joe Biden. They told him he couldn’t win. His debate performance wasn’t the best ever, but they said mine was the best ever. But they said his debate performance wasn’t. I look forward to debating her, by the way. She’ll be easier, she’ll be easier than him. Her policies are so bad. Her policy, remember her father was a Marxist economic professor. He was a Marxist, an avowed Marxist. This is not what we want in this country. And think of it. Does anyone here feel richer under Kamala Harris and Crooked Joe?

Crowd (09:19):

No.

Donald J. Trump (09:21):

Is anything less expensive under Kamala Harris or Crooked Joe?

Crowd (09:26):

No.

Donald J. Trump (09:26):

No, no. It’s been devastating. Inflation. Inflation has been devastating under this group of people that have no idea what the hell they’re doing. Are you better off with Kamala and Biden than you were under President Donald J. Trump? I don’t think so. They do polls and this stuff and I’m at like 93%. I said, “Why are we having an election? They didn’t have an election. Why are we having an election?” How would you like to be Biden? He’s working. He’s spending money. He’s trying. They wanted to have a debate. That’s the thing that started it all. If I didn’t debate him, he’d still be running right now. But I believe she will be easier to beat than him because she’s a truly radical left lunatic.
(10:20)
And with him, he never really believed it. Of course, I don’t know if he knew anything. I am not sure. But he didn’t really believe it. She totally believes it. She wants to destroy our country. With four more years of Kamala, your finances will never recover. They will only get worse. They’re only going to get worse. The stock market, and we have some of the most brilliant people on Wall Street saying the stock market is only up because they think I’m going to win and if we don’t win, according to many people, including one of the greatest Wall Street prognosticators, Scott Bessent, has anyone heard of him? One of the most brilliant guys on Wall Street, if I don’t win, you will have a 1929 style depression. Enjoy it. I believe that. I believe that. I believe it. A lot of people believe it, so we’re not going to give them the chance, okay? We’re not going to give them.
(11:23)
And your state’s going to be ruined anyway, she’s totally anti-fracking. She’s been anti- fracking and anti-drilling, anti-oil and gas from practically the day she was born. All of a sudden a couple of months ago, she said, “Oh, I’d love to have fracking.” No, she won’t have fracking. Vote Trump and your incomes will soar. Your savings will grow. Young people will be able to afford a home, and we will bring back the American dream bigger. We are going to bring it back. Bigger, better front-row Joe. Bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. We’re going to bring it back. Look at all these front-row Joes over here. They’ve only been, we have a couple of groups here. They’re at about 222 events. Front-Row Joes, stand up, wave your hands, there, you guys are great. Patriots.
(12:22)
But I have another group from a place called North Carolina. Has anybody ever heard of North? We love North Carolina. The beautiful ladies over there. This is number, what? 217, so this is number 217, and supposedly they’re happily married. How the hell does that work? Look at them. They’re beautiful and they, oh, there’s a husband. Are you a husband? Who are you married to husband? Oh, that was a wise choice. Beautiful. Very nice. How do you handle it, right? How do you handle? But they’re great women and they’ve been with us from the very beginning. They were with us from the beginning in 2016 when we had the four greatest years this country has ever had. They were with us then. Thank you very much.
(13:17)
North Carolina. We’re doing well in North Carolina. Thank you, darling. It’s nice to not have to travel to California and other places, right? Yesterday, Kamala laid out her so-called economic plan. She says she’s going to lower the cost of food and housing starting on day one, but day one for Kamala was three and a half years ago so why didn’t she do it then? This is day 1,305. We’re at 1,305. So why isn’t she doing it now? Why doesn’t she get away from her nice little place with her wonderful husband, go to Washington and do it now? You could do it right now. Why does she go to the convention? Because it’s a rigged convention, obviously. She got no votes. He had 14, Sleepy Joe had 14 million votes. She got no votes. She failed. She was the first one out. She failed. She never got to Iowa. Great state, Iowa. We’re going to win it big. The farmers love Trump and I love the farmers, but she never got to Iowa. She was the first one to quit and now she’s running for president.
(14:39)
Somebody’s going to have to explain our system to our many enemies all around the world. They’re watching, they’re saying, “This place doesn’t make a lot of sense anymore.” Everything Kamala Harris says in her speeches is a lie. She gets up and just lies. I was watching her yesterday. She talked about all the taxes I was going to raise. I never said that. I’m lowering taxes. Yesterday she got up. She started ranting and raving that Donald Trump wants to put a tax on gasoline, a tax on food, a tax on medication, a tax on clothing, a tax on every single thing that was ever invented. Your hat, he’s going to tax. Your shirt he is going to tax. He’s going to tax your wife, he’s going to tax your husband. And I’m saying, I never said any of that. They make it up.
(15:31)
Here’s the truth. Kamala wants to put massive taxes on American jobs and American industries. I want to cut taxes on Americans while putting tariffs on China and foreign countries to bring our jobs back home to Pennsylvania and to take in billions and billions of dollars. I’m the only one that ever took in any money from China. China was really hitting us hard, ripping us apart, that means many, many presidents. And what happened is I put a tariff on then I raised the tariff. We took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China and Biden gets so much money, he’s trying to rescind it for a couple of reasons. Number one, he got a lot of money from China. Didn’t he get three and a half million, 4 million that they know of? But he got a lot more than that. His family made a lot of money with China. He wants to get rid of the tariff, but he can’t because there’s so much money they can’t do anything with the budget. A tariff is a tax on a foreign country. That’s the way it is, whether you like it or not. A lot of people like to say it’s a tax on us. No, no, no. It’s a tax on a foreign country.
(16:42)
It’s a tax on a country that’s ripping us off and stealing our jobs and it’s a tax that doesn’t affect our country. And you could see hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs on other countries also. I took in hundreds of billions and nothing happened to us. They make less money. And you know what? Our jobs come back because there’s no tax if they build their factory in Pennsylvania, there’s no tax if they build their factory in the United States. So what do they do in order to avoid paying the tax? They say, “Let’s build a place over here. No tax.” Come on over. We love it. Just hire our people. That’s all you have to do. It’s very simple.
(17:28)
As we speak, and this really goes to Michigan more than you, but I look at Michigan and South Carolina, a lot of other places that do the auto stuff, and they are building some of the biggest auto factories in the world right now in Mexico, right off our border. They think they’re going to make cars, not pay any tax and sell those cars into the United States. Not going to happen. Not with me. They’re building some of the biggest auto plants in the world. And you know who owns those auto plants? They’re built. They’re made and being built in Mexico. You know who owns them? China owns them. China’s very smart. I had a good relationship with President Xi. When Covid came, that was the end of that relationship. But I had a very good relationship. But we took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China. Think of it, Bush, Barack, Hussein. Did you ever hear of Barack, Hussein, Obama? Have you heard of her?
(18:27)
There are those that think he is currently running the country. Does anybody think? I don’t know. I don’t know that that’s true. We know it’s not Biden. Every attack Kamala makes on us is a fabricated, it’s a lie. She’s a bad storyteller. She doesn’t know how to tell a story very well, but she gets caught, she got caught up in her own words. She’s not a very good wordsmith they say. I don’t know. We’re going to find out. We’re going to have a debate at some point. They gave me, the worst network to me is ABC, worse than NBC, worse than CBS, worse than CNN. The home of George Slopidopoulos, a nasty guy. I said, “George, I’ve had you up to here.” It’s true. He’s a nasty guy. The hatred. And yet when he interviews Biden, two weeks ago, he interviewed Biden, it was like the nicest interview. “What flavor ice cream do you like?” “George, I tend to vanilla very much.”
(19:36)
With me they get into a lot of subjects that a lot of people don’t like talking about. But ABC is the worst. And that seems because they won’t do it on Fox. They’ve turned down the Fox. I’ve approved three debates. They’ve approved one. The only one they’ve approved was their network. And now it came out in the New York Times of all places that the head of the news and the head of the whole thing practically is Kamala and her husband, lovely husband, best friend, her and her husband are best friends with Kamala and her husband. And I’m supposed to do the debate. But with Biden, they thought I wouldn’t do it so they offered me something that I couldn’t accept. They said, “The debate is at CNN in front of no audience.” So far, I’m oh for two. And see, they didn’t want to do the debate. That would’ve been a good idea if they didn’t do it, but I was going to accept anything. Then I guess we’ll do it here too, right? We’ll accept anything because otherwise she’s not going to debate.
(20:41)
She doesn’t want to debate, but they said, “CNN and no audience, and we want to have you sit down.” I objected to that. They wanted us sitting behind the desk. I said, “Give me a break. We have to at least stand for the American public.” Wouldn’t that be nice? That was the only thing, and I would’ve done it if they insisted. No, I would’ve sat down if they insisted. But I thought it was sort of a little strange. But I had Dana Bash and I had Fake Tapper. But I have to tell you, they were very fair. I really thought they were very fair.
(21:13)
Jake and Dana, nobody knows how to say her first name. Is it Dana or Danna? Nobody knows. It’s been going on for 20 years. She’s been around a long time. Is it Dana or Danna? And now the fake news will say, “Trump didn’t know how to pronounce her first name.” She doesn’t know how to pronounce, but look, but Danna and Jake, I used to call him Fake Tapper. Now I call him Jake Tapper because he treated us very fairly and so did Danna treat me very fairly. I think it was just about neutral. But he kept saying, he gave very short answers because he wasn’t really doing too well. And I kept saying, “I’ll take it.” But what happened? “Sir, you have 92 seconds left.” This is not what he wanted to hear. “Right, David,” they said, “You have 92 seconds left,” going to be your next senator I’ll tell you, David McCormick. I hope you can vote for him. I hope you vote for him.
(22:18)
I hope you vote for him. He is a great gentleman, great hero actually in many ways. He’s a great guy. But so they gave me this thing and they assumed I was going to turn it down so I have the wrong network. I have the wrong anchors. I have no audience. I like an audience. I love people. It’s oftentimes a mistake. Everything was wrong. So what we’ll do is we’ll offer him this thing that he can’t accept. He won’t accept it. And then we’ll say, “Trump didn’t accept the debate. He’s afraid to negotiate against Biden because Biden is so sharp. He’s so sharp. He’s sharp like a razor.” But I surprised them. I said, “I’ll take it. I’ll take it.” And people said, “Are you crazy?” I said, “Look, it’s the only way you’re going to debate. If we do anything else, they’re not going to accept it.” And these people are the same way. They offered me … we were supposed to have Fox on September 4th. And they said, “No.” I accepted it. I don’t even know what’s going to happen because I’ve accepted it. They haven’t. So maybe they show up, maybe they don’t. But I think it’s sort of on for September 4th, but I don’t think they’re going to come. And then we go and we do the debate with ABC. ABC, again, I call it ABC Fake News, so bad. They’re so bad. They’re so dishonest, in my opinion. Very dishonest people. But I find them to be the worst. And I really am a professional at this because I watch the … who treats me the worst?
(23:55)
Now, NBC is horrible. CBS is horrible. They’re all horrible. These are horrible human beings. But who treats me the worst? ABC Fake News treats me the worst. And that’s where they want it. Where her best friend, and it just came out the other day. Nobody told anybody about this, is the head of the whole deal, right? But I’ll probably say, “I’ll take it” because you know what they’re not going to do a debate? But just remember, these are phony, fake, disgusting people that hate our country. Remember that. And also remember that every attack that we make on Kamala is something that she said on tape or something that she’s actually done. All of these attacks are things because she said all of it. She said, “I don’t want fracking in Pennsylvania.” She said it hundreds of times. “I don’t want it anywhere,” then a couple of months ago, when the polls are showing that she’s getting clobbered, well actually, nobody actually thought they were politically correct. They wanted to be politically correct because they wanted, they had 11 different people and they put her name in to be number 12, and they had a vote. She came in last.
(25:17)
She picked somebody, think of it, how about the guy she picked, how bad is he, right? How bad is that guy? David, where do these people come from? He recently signed a bill in a state that I love, but a state that hasn’t been won by a Republican because it’s a corrupt state, but the people are not corrupt. The people are great. Since 1972 hasn’t been won. And I thought we won it twice, I said, “There’s no way we lose Minnesota.” But he signed a bill for all young men’s bathrooms and men’s bathrooms, have to be equipped with a tampon-selling machine. And she turned down, your governor, by the way, just so you understand, I know some of you probably like him. I don’t think he’s a good person. I don’t think he’s good. I don’t think he’s good. But they turned him down because he’s Jewish. Okay. That’s why they turned him down.
(26:32)
Now we can be politically correct and not say that. I could say, “Well, they turned him down for various reasons.” No, no. They turned him down because he’s Jewish, that’s why they turned him down. And I’ll tell you this, any Jewish person that votes for her or a Democrat has to go out and have their head examined because if you see what’s happening with Israel and Jewish people right now, there has never been a more dangerous time since the Holocaust. If you happen to be Jewish in America, there’s never been anything like it. I’m seeing things, I can’t even believe it, and we want to bring about unity and peace and everything else. It looks like they’re going to have nothing but riots out there in Chicago. It’s really a sad thing. But they turned him down for that reason and they turned him down for a couple of other reasons too. But the primary reason was that he’s Jewish. And you don’t think I know what goes on in their campaign. I know it well. I know it very well. She’s a nation-wrecker who is more liberal than crazy Bernie Sanders. You know Crazy Bernie. He’s pretty bad, right? She is substantially more radicalized than Crazy Bernie. You cannot have her as your president. She ruined San Francisco.

Donald J. Trump (28:00):

She ruined the state of California. No, she was a district attorney, and she was the attorney general of the state. I heard the other day, and this isn’t anything, I’m just saying… They’ll say, “He was rambling.” I don’t ramble. I’m really smart guy, really smart. I don’t ramble. But the other day, anytime I hit too hard, they say he was rambling. Rambling? I get up and I make a speech. I go for sometimes two hours, two and a half hours, because people are waiting outside for three days, four days. You guys were waiting out there for a long time. Front row Joes are waiting out… I don’t know how you guys do it. And I feel I have an obligation to speak, and speak in a certain way, and speak a little bit longer.
(28:47)
How would you like it? A guy’s waiting with his family for three and a half, four days. They have a tent, and the tent is set up. They have hundreds of them, and they wait. And then I walk in, speak for 15 minutes, and leave. I don’t know, somehow, would that be okay, North Carolina? I don’t think so, right?

Audience (29:04):

No!

Donald J. Trump (29:05):

They want me to speak all day. When I leave, I did one, two hours and 15 minutes, and I’m leaving, and they’re screaming, “No, sir, more! We want to hear more!” I said, “I can’t!” I said, “I can’t speak more! What the hell else am I going to say? Our country’s going to hell. That’s all I can say. We’re a nation in decline.” We were talking about that before. My phrases are copied so much, right? I use the term, oftentimes in closing, “We are a nation in decline. We are a failed nation.” And I think it’s a beautiful phrase, although I don’t like the topic very much, I don’t like what it represents, but there’s a certain beauty. All of a sudden, all of these candidates, including Republicans, are saying, “We are a nation in decline. We are a failing nation.” And I say, “What the hell do they have to copy me for?” Right?
(30:01)
But they have a lot of words that they copy, many of our words. We were in the plane before, coming in, and our people said, we went through a list. I think we’re going to release a list. Let’s release it. But so many of our phrases, they copy. Really, that should be a nice thing. Not an insult. But crazy Bernie Sanders has said a lot of things, and one of the things he’s arguing about is who’s more liberal. And after about two minutes, he gave up. He said, “This woman is nuts.” Look, people say be nice. Have you heard her laugh? That is the laugh of a crazy person. That is the laugh of a crazy. It’s the laugh of a lunatic. Have you heard it? You know, they prohibited her. They prohibited her for laughing. I’ve been waiting for her to laugh, because as soon as she laughs, the election’s over. But we’re winning by a lot in Pennsylvania. I think the fracking got her. The fracking got her.
(31:00)
But she has been prohibited from laughing. She used to do an interview, she’d go… Who the hell laughs at an interview like that? I’m interviewed all the time, I may smile. They’re asking you questions about things that… It’s not like a comedy club. And she’d break out. That’s one of the reasons she refuses to do interviews, I think, because she laughs, it’s so horrible. No, it’s so horrible. But you know she hasn’t done an interview in 30 days or something like that? And I do one every day. I just did one backstage. I just did one backstage with a very good reporter. But you’re supposed to. Don’t you sort of have an obligation? You’re running. They’re going to try. This is her form of the basement.
(31:55)
Now, the basement for him was good because they had COVID, they didn’t want him to catch COVID, he ended up catching it anyway. But the whole system is very dishonest, but she should be at least talking to the press. She hasn’t done anything. But she’s prohibited from laughing. They said, “Your laugh is horrible. Never laugh, ever.” So, she’s walking around with her mouth almost sealed shut. She won’t laugh. I want her to laugh! And then we’ll just claim victory. Ladies and gentlemen, like to thank you very much. But we have a little video that we just put up. Would you like to see it?

Audience (32:35):

Yes!

Donald J. Trump (32:36):

Go ahead. Just one.

Music (32:38):

Yeah, I am radical. You need to get radical about what we’re doing, and take it seriously. As president of the United States, I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster to pass a Green New Deal. There’s no question, I’m in favor of banning fracking. We have to have a buyback program, and I support a mandatory buyback program.

Jake Tapper (33:02):

I believe it will totally eliminate private insurance.

Music (33:04):

Let’s eliminate all of that.

Erin Burnett (33:08):

But would you support changing the dietary guidelines?

Music (33:10):

Yes.

Erin Burnett (33:11):

The food pyramid?

Music (33:12):

Yes.

Erin Burnett (33:13):

To reduce red meat specifically?

Music (33:14):

Yes, I would.

Music (33:17):

Raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.

Ebro Darden (33:25):

Where do you stand on defund the police?

Music (33:27):

This whole movement is about rightly saying we need to take a look at these budgets.

Music (33:33):

Harris asserted that ICE is perceived as the modern day Ku Klux Klan.

Music (33:39):

Are you aware that there’s a perception-

Music (33:41):

I see no-

Music (33:42):

Are you aware that there’s a perception-

Music (33:43):

… perception that puts ICE in the same category as the KKK. Is that where you’re asking me? I see no parallel.

Music (33:48):

I’m not finished.

Music (33:48):

I see none.

Music (33:51):

Maybe I am radical. We need to get radical about what we are doing.

Audience (33:54):

Boo!

Donald J. Trump (34:02):

Now, over the years, and right up until the present, she wanted to openly defund the police. How do you like that?

Audience (34:10):

Boo!

Donald J. Trump (34:13):

In Minnesota, when they were burning down the state, and in particular Minneapolis, they were burning it down. Remember the CNN fake reporter? He got up, the one with the nice shaved head, he got up. “This is a peaceful rally. This is a rally of love.” Behind him, the entire city was burning. It looked like World War II, right? And by the way, speaking of World War II, she will bring us into World War III, and that’ll be a war like never before, because of the weaponry. No more army tanks going back and forth shooting.
(34:50)
We’ve left a lot of our… I rebuilt the entire military, and we left a lot of that in a place called Afghanistan. You know that? Billions and billions of dollars, we left it. In the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, we left billions of dollars. 13 great soldiers killed. Think of it. Left many hostages. Many people have been left behind. But think of what happened there. We got out in disgrace. We should have gotten out with strength. I was getting out. We would’ve been out even sooner, but strength, dignity, we would’ve kept Bagram. The big air base. You know who occupies Bagram right now? China. Because it was one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons. Not because of Afghanistan, but because of China. But China occupies it right now. Thank you very much, President Xi, enjoy our billions of dollars of construction that took place years ago. They spent billions of dollars many years ago. One hour away, think of that, where they make their nuclear weapons. It’s so embarrassing, the stupidity of the people that have run our country. But we did things the opposite way. We were very smart, we were very respected, we were a respected country. They respected your leader, elected leader. But remember this. Viktor Orban of Hungary, prime minister of Hungary, they asked him pretty recently, they said, “What’s going on? The world is coming to an end.” He said, “If you want to stop it, the United States, reelect Donald Trump. Because when he was there, he didn’t have any problems. We didn’t have problems.” Russia wouldn’t have happened with Ukraine. Israel would’ve never been attacked on October 7th, never. You know Iran was broke? Iran was broke. They had no money. I told China, “You buy oil from them, you can’t deal with us.” I told that to many countries, anybody that dealt there, so they didn’t buy oil. Oil’s the whole thing, the big deal. And they were broke. Now they have $3 billion, think of it. They have $300 billion now, they have plenty of money.
(37:02)
We’re run by stupid people, and we have to change it, or we’re not going to have a country left. We didn’t let countries take advantage of us. France was going to charge our corporations tremendous amounts of money for doing business in France. You know this, David. David is very familiar with what happened. And I went to my people. I said, “Tell them we’re not going to put up with it. They’re not going to charge our companies, because we want our companies to do well so they can employ people.” It’s sort of simple. I didn’t even like a lot of the companies that they were dealing with. I should have said, “Oh, great, let them charge. What the hell do I care?” But they’re American companies. And I said to Emmanuel Macron, I said, “Call him, because my people failed to make a deal.” I said, “You make a deal, you have one week. Come see me.”
(37:46)
At the end of a week, they came to see me. Good people, smart people, very smart people. Secretary of Treasury, smart guy, Mnuchin, others. They came back to see me. “Sir, we’re not able to make a deal. They’re going to charge our companies a tax.” I said, “No, no, they’re not going to do it. You don’t understand. They’re not going to do it. Come back and see me. You have one more day.” They came back, “Sir, they won’t do it. They’ve already passed it in their so-called legislature. We’re not going to do it. They’re not going to be able to stop it, sir.” I said, “We’ll stop it. Get Emmanuel Macron on the phone.”
(38:22)
I got him on the phone. “Emmanuel, how are you? So nice to talk.” “Oh, Donald, Donald, it is so nice to speak to you.” It’s beautiful. I wish I had his accent, I would’ve been president 20 years ago. But I said, “Emmanuel, I understand you’re charging our companies a lot of money?” “Oh, well, this has been in the works for many years, Donald. Yes, it is done, it is really done. There’s nothing we can do about it.”
(38:50)
I said, “Okay, good. Emmanuel, here’s the story. If you don’t get rid of that tax within 24 hours, starting on Monday morning,” it was a Friday, “I’m going to charge every bottle of wine and champagne that you send into our country. I’m going to charge you a tariff of 100% on every bottle, and you will not be sending too many bottles of champagne.” And he said, “Donald, Donald, that is not fair. That is not fair.” I said, “No, no. It’s not fair for you to be charging American companies to do business in your country. No, it’s not fair, Emmanuel. Emmanuel, get back to me in five minutes and let me know.” He called me back in two minutes. He said, “Donald, we have decided that we will not be charging you any taxes for the American companies.”
(39:48)
I did so many of them. I did so many. I could stand up here all day and tell you different stories. I just used the telephone. I could stop the war with a telephone. I could stop what’s happening in the Middle East with a couple of telephone calls, properly placed. Horrible. Horrible, horrible, horrible. We have people that are babies. In many ways, I guess they’re stupid. People say, “Please don’t use bad language! Please don’t call people stupid!” They’re stupid people. How else do you describe it? I want to use a different word, a more sophisticated word than stupid, but there’s no word. It’s a perfect word. They’re stupid people.
(40:36)
I think they’re also, by the way, if I might, they’re also corrupt. They really are, they’re corrupt. They get a lot of money from a lot of people. We’re not going to let this socialist lunatic… And she’s a socialist lunatic. That’s the other thing. “Please, sir. Please don’t call her a lunatic.” I said, “But that’s what she is.” She’s a lunatic. She’s a lunatic. She’s going to destroy our country.
(41:09)
And she’s going to break our economy even more than it’s broken. We have a broken economy. Our supply chain is gone. You order something now, I don’t know how many of you are in business, or even if you’re ordering as a personal order, the order doesn’t come. The supply chain is broken. Whoever thought of it, we never even talked about supply chain. Supply chain just worked. And because of what they’ve done, they’ve broken our supply chain. On election day, we’re going to tell her that we’ve had enough. We said, “Kamala, you’re a horrible vice president, you’re going to be a horrible president. We’re not going to take it anymore. Kamala, you’re fired! Get out of there! You’re fired!” Not going to take it anymore, Kamala.

Audience (42:01):

USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!

Donald J. Trump (42:21):

We’re not going to take it anymore. We have a country to save. And how about the fake news? Oh, look at them all back here, look at all those cameras.

Audience (42:30):

Boo!

Donald J. Trump (42:32):

Look at all those cameras. Wow. Look at all those cameras, all those fake writers. Look at them. Time Magazine, think of this. Time Magazine doesn’t have a picture of her. They have this unbelievable artist drawing her. And I said, “Is that Sophia Loren?” I couldn’t… Who might that be? Is that Elizabeth Taylor? They say she was a beautiful woman. Who is it? It’s so beautiful. Drawing. It’s a drawing. They took a lot of pictures, it didn’t work out, so they hired a sketch artist. I said, “I’m sure, oh, they must be celebrating the great life and times of the magnificently beautiful Sophia Loren.” And you’re not allowed to say this anymore. David, don’t ever get caught in this trap, David, please. Don’t ever call a woman beautiful, because that’ll be the end of your political career. Please. I want to make your life much easier, David. By the way, he’s also got a great wife, I have to say, he’s got a great wife.
(43:46)
But I read a so-called Republican, who Ronald Reagan didn’t like, by the way, and she didn’t like him, but she got credit for being this Reagan speech writer. Highly overrated. I don’t know anything about her, I don’t know her. Treats me badly, but that’s okay. She called it wrong. She’s called it wrong now for about eight years. But she said one thing that got me. She said Kamala has one big advantage. She’s a very beautiful woman.

Audience (44:21):

Boo!

Donald J. Trump (44:21):

She’s a beautiful woman. So, I decided to go back and reread the clause. “I’m not saying he’s…” But I say that I am much better looking than her. I think I’m much better, much better. I’m a better looking person than Kamala! No, I couldn’t believe it. I had never heard that one. They said, “No, her biggest advantage is that she’s a beautiful woman.” I’m going, “Huh.” I never thought of that. I’m better looking than she is.
(44:54)
In her speech yesterday, Kamala went full communist. You heard that? She went full communist. She wants to destroy our country. After causing catastrophic inflation, Comrade Kamala announced that she wants to institute socialist price controls. You saw that? Never worked before. Never ever worked. This is the Maduro plan. Venezuela Maduro plan of the old Soviet Union. They tried it. How did the Soviet Union work out? It became Russia, smaller version. It was a smaller version. It will cause rationing, hunger, and skyrocketing prices, just like their Inflation Reduction Act caused. One of the great scams of all time. They got it approved with a beautiful name: Inflation Reduction. Because inflation, under their system, has been so bad. It’s gone up much more than 50%. They say, “30, 40, 50.” Much more. People are being devastated. They’re being devastated. But it’s gone way up, way up. And they made a big mistake yesterday in her speech. I think she said, I had to play it back. I love the playback controls you have nowadays. They used to call it TiVo, now they have TiVo, all the… I think it’s the single greatest invention. It’s better than television, because television would drive you crazy if you couldn’t do a playback, right? Now I can playback. I heard the statement, and I heard that statement that she made, and she made a statement yesterday that, from her time in office, essentially, prices have gone up by 50%, something like… I said, “Did she just say that?” I said, “That speech writer is going to be fired.” In fact, we took that section and we actually made a commercial on it, and we got the best commercial of the week, and we didn’t do anything. We just played her back.
(46:53)
But here’s the problem. The things that she said yesterday don’t work. They have never worked. They’ve never been used. Many times before, in many other countries, they’ve never worked. They’ve just never worked. They’ve been used oftentimes, many countries, and in every single event, it ruined those countries. It’s a communist system. It’s what her father, a Marxist, he was a Marxist, it’s what her father taught her, from a young girl growing up. She’s promising to hand out things she can’t deliver. She can never deliver them, she’ll never get them approved. Just like when she and Crooked Joe tried to give away student debt. Remember? She wanted to pay. How did that work out? Not too good. The students are saying, “I love him because of student debt.” But he got rejected.
(47:42)
And this will be rejected even more so, because what they’re doing is a communist takeover of our country. Her plan is very dangerous, because it may sound good politically, and that’s the problem. And we have to be very careful, because when somebody gets up and says, “We’re going to give you everything: $25,000 for a house, we’re going to give you all sorts of little goodies, free healthcare, we’re going to give you everything, universal healthcare.” Sounds so beautiful. And I told my people, you got to be very careful. I told the Republican Party, you have to be very careful. She’s giving all this away, and somebody that really isn’t into it. We’re largely, even groups like this, we’re into it. We think about it all the time. We want to take back our country. We want to save our country.
(48:25)
And you understand how bad this stuff is? This is communist, this is Marxist, this is fascist. But you know what? It’s dangerous because she’s saying that she’s going to give away things that she’ll never be able to get approved. She wants to increase the number of justices on the United States Supreme Court to 27. 27. I used to hear she was going up to 11, and then I heard it was 13. But then they said that’s an unlucky number, so they went to 15. Yesterday for the first time, I heard 27. We’ll have to rebuild the entire Supreme Court, because they won’t have enough room for the judges. They won’t have enough.
(49:04)
And by the way, how courageous were our justices of the United States Supreme Court? What they did, they’re saving our country. They’re actually saving our country. What they’ve done is they’ve passed things that were so important, and they did it for the right, not for the wrong. They did the right thing. They did the right thing. And I just have such respect for them. The job they’ve done against… And the radical left plays the ref. You know the great Bobby Knight? He supported me. He used to fight with the referees all the time. Scream at them. “Bobby, Bobby, please don’t do that. It’s not going to work.” He said, “You’re right, it’s not going to work now; it’s going to work for the next one.” And the next call, there’d be a flagrant foul and they wouldn’t call it. They didn’t want to get screamed at.
(49:57)
The radical left harasses our judges, and harasses our justices. They scream at them. They call them names. They say they’re incompetent. They’re horrible. They’re this, they’re that. They should be impeached. They’re constantly saying they should be impeached. But they’re screaming. And you know what? It has an effect on some people. But so far, they’ve been very strong. It’s really horrible. I believe it’s illegal, what they do. And I’m trying to give you things that you’ve never heard before, and this is true. I believe they are playing the ref. They’re constantly criticizing our great, some of our greatest, justices, and a lot of great judges.
(50:46)
I kept hearing so much about the Florida case, because you know they weaponized our system. Our government totally weaponized it. First time it’s ever happened. And they said my biggest case is in Florida, Florida, Florida. We had a very brilliant, I don’t know the judge, but a fair and very brilliant judge, who took tremendous abuse. Would’ve been so easy for her to just rule against me. But she didn’t do that. She threw out the whole case. It was thrown out. That was a big case. And I have such respect for her, because she is, in fact, brilliant. But they were hitting her so hard. ” She’s going too slow. She’s not, she should be removed immediately from office.” These people are horrible. I really think it’s illegal, what they do with judges and justices. They’re playing the ref. No different than Bobby Knight.
(51:46)
And he was great. He endorsed me, and Indiana was mine, he was a great coach. He’s the last coach to go undefeated. I guess he was like 38 [inaudible 00:51:54]. For some reason, they’ve never had another college team since then. That was many years ago. And he came out in favor of Donald Trump, and it was a big thing. I won Indiana by a landslide. Because when Bobby Knight from Indiana endorses you, you win. Sort of like when I endorse you, you win too. We have a very good record of endorsement.
(52:14)
But we can’t let these radical left thugs constantly scream at our judges and say, “We’re going to impeach him. We’re going to take him out of office.” Or her. “We’re going to do horrible things to him.” Continuous. When you heard Schumer get up on the stairs of the courthouse, Supreme Court, and talk about Kavanaugh, “We’re going to get you, Kavanaugh. We’re going to hit you.” Or whatever the hell he said. If a mobster said that, they’d be put in jail immediately. He frankly should have been put in jail, or certainly spoken to very strongly. He got lucky. He got lucky. He had a couple of guys that didn’t want to do it, and I understand that also. But he got lucky. But we can’t let them do that.
(53:05)
And I just want to pay my respect to the judges that have suffered abuse at the hands of the radical left lunatics. And I really admire them for… Because you know what? All they have to do to end it is rule against me or whatever it is. If they say, “Trump, you’re guilty.” Oh, now all of a sudden they say, “Oh.” That’s the last time they ever say a bad… But they can’t do it, because these people have weaponized the Justice Department, including local DAs and local attorney generals. And Fani, Fani. You know Fani? Spelled F-A-N-I. “My name is Fani, F-A-N-I.” I don’t figure it. She put a little French accent on the word with her lover, Wade. Right? Lover Wade, we call him, Lover Boy Wade. She hired and paid him almost a million dollars because of his great knowledge of the law. He never did it before.
(54:06)
With us today is Daniel Campos, a pilot in Venezuela who now lives in Pennsylvania. Great gentleman. Daniel came to tell us what you think of Kamala Harris leading our country into socialism. We’re being led into socialism, but the socialism will be short-lived. It’s going into communism. If you would’ve told me, and if you remember many times during State of the Unions, I would say, “We will never have a socialist country.” And everybody would applaud. But I was right, because we’re really, I think, skipping socialism. We’re going into communism. When they weaponize our government like this, that’s what they do in Third World countries. That’s what they do in South American horror shows. That’s what they do in banana republics. They’ve weaponized it.
(54:59)
But I believe ours is even more corrupt. The New York court system is totally corrupt. They use the state and the city to go after me. They take top people in the Department of Justice and put them in. The Attorney General Leticia James, she campaigned, and, “I will get Trump!” And they then go there, and then they go into the Manhattan DA’s office. They use Hillary Clinton’s lawyer and the Democrats’ law firm to leave the firm and go into the DA’s office in order to prosecute Donald Trump, free of charge. They’re not going to charge. Then he writes a book, this guy writes a book, before the thing even went anywhere. And in the book he said, “I do it for free, it’s so great.” These are corrupt people, and we have to call them out. So, remember the term, playing the ref with our judges and our justices should be punishable by very serious fines and beyond that. But I’d like to ask, because

Donald J. Trump (56:00):

Because we’re into that whole system. And I’d like to call up Daniel. Please come up and tell us about your experience in living in a country that went very, very bad, went radical left, and the experience has not been good. Please come up. Thank you. Hi, Daniel.

Music (56:17):

Thank you. I’m so pleased to meet you.

Donald J. Trump (56:19):

How are you?

Music (56:19):

Appreciate it.

Donald J. Trump (56:19):

Nice to see you. Please.

Music (56:19):

Okay.

Speaker 1 (56:19):

Daniel.

Music (56:25):

All right. First of all, hi, everybody. Thank you for coming here and supporting the president. I’m going to say the first part of the speech, well, of my story, in English, then I’m going to repeat it in Spanish in order to allow our Latino voters to understand and hear what the situation is going on.
(56:57)
First of all, as the president already said, I’m from Venezuela. I left the country in 2007 because of communism. I still have family there. There’s been family that has left even before me, or continues leaving little by little. But going farther back, my grandparents from my mom’s side were from Cuba. They were at university when the communist revolution was going on, and they ended up leaving to Venezuela. They only have the money they received for as their wedding present, and they were living in a mid-house, going to school, and trying to move ahead.
(57:41)
My granddad ended up becoming a doctor, and had a family, raising three children, my mom and my two uncles, when, in the early 1990s, Chavez did a military coup. And right after he run for president, my granddad saw the similarities to what was happening in Cuba, and he told everybody that would listen to him that it was coming. And everybody was like, “No, this is Venezuela. This is not Cuba. This will never happen to us.” And guess what? It happened to us and has been happening to other Latin American countries as well.

Donald J. Trump (58:16):

Right here.

Music (58:17):

So when they tell you here, it will never happen, that’s not true. We lived it. Now here we are. So, in 2007, we ended up leaving because the socialists and the government, they start changing the education system to make it more like the Cuban education system. It might ring a bell to what’s going on here as well. So, it’s extremely important for everybody to keep this in mind. And if you don’t mind, I’m going to switch to Spanish for our Latino speakers.

Donald J. Trump (58:48):

Yeah, good job.

Music (58:48):

Thank you. [Foreign language 00:58:55]. Going back in English, that we are going on a path that is taking us to what Venezuela became, and the only way right now that we can avoid keep going down that path is making Trump president again. Thank you. It’s a pleasure.

Donald J. Trump (01:00:22):

Have you done that before?

Music (01:00:22):

No.

Donald J. Trump (01:00:22):

Oh, wow.

Music (01:00:22):

[inaudible 01:00:22].

Donald J. Trump (01:00:22):

Thank you, Daniel.

Music (01:00:22):

No problem. Good luck.

Crowd (01:00:22):

USA!

Donald J. Trump (01:00:37):

Wow.

Crowd (01:00:37):

USA!

Donald J. Trump (01:00:37):

Great.

Crowd (01:00:37):

USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!

Donald J. Trump (01:00:45):

What a fantastic job. I said, “Have you done that before?” He said, “No, sir.” You are something. All right. What office is he going to run for? I think we’re going to endorse him so fast. Thank you very much. No, it’s such a problem because it’s a very dangerous situation. She’s giving everybody free everything. It’s never going to happen. Remember the college debt, the student debt they were going to give? It never happened. It was just all talk. Then he said, after getting totally rejected… He came up with another plan, which is even dumber. But what happens is they talk. These things will never happen, but it’s very dangerous because politically maybe somebody says, “Oh, that’s great. That’s great.” It’s the end of our country. We can’t do it. We can’t do it. So, I really appreciate that. That was beautiful. That was so well done. Amazing. Thank you.
(01:01:41)
In addition to defeating Kamala Harris, you need to defeat your terrible Democrat Senator Bob Casey. I’ve been in Washington for a long time. I mean, I barely met the guy. Most of these guys I get to meet in one form or another, for better or worse. I hardly know this guy. I never really remember meeting him. He obviously created a great impression. But he’s not a hard worker. He’s cruising on his father’s past. I met the father. I think I knew the father better than I knew the son.
(01:02:20)
But Bob Casey voted for every bill that caused the worst inflation in the history of our country, in my opinion. They call it decades, but I believe it’s the history of our country because they’re not using the real things. Like, mortgage rates went from 2% to 10%. They don’t say that. That’s inflation. They don’t say that. And you can’t get any money at 10% either. We had it down to two and 2.4, 2.5%, and now you can’t get the money at 10%. They don’t have any money. He voted to open borders and the war on Pennsylvania energy. Bob Casey voted against all of this stuff, against your state, but you don’t know because you have other jobs. You’re not watching Bob Casey. That’s why you need to fire Bob Casey, and you have to elect a man named David McCormick for the U.S. Senate.
(01:03:10)
Dave is strong on borders, great on taxes. He wants to reduce your taxes. All my life, I’ve been involved, usually from the other side, it’s called writing checks, but I’ve been involved. I’ve made lots of contributions to politicians all my life. And politicians always talked about, “We will lower your taxes.” That’s all they talked about is lowering tax. This is the only group I’ve ever seen where they say, “We are going to increase your taxes.” I’ve never heard of it before. And by four times. I gave you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, and bigger than the Reagan tax cuts. And they expire in a few months, and they want to not renew them. If that’s the case, you’re going to pay four times the tax that you’re paying right now. And then they, on top of that, want to increase your taxes to pay for the green new scam. You know what the green new scam is?

Speaker 2 (01:04:17):

Yeah.

Speaker 3 (01:04:17):

Yeah.

Donald J. Trump (01:04:18):

The oceans will rise one-eighth of an inch over the next 400 years, but they don’t talk about a madman that’s building nuclear missiles right now. That’s your real global warming. It’s not this.

Speaker 4 (01:04:32):

That’s right.

Donald J. Trump (01:04:33):

Your global warming is war. Your global warming is going to be nuclear weapons. Nobody talks about that. They don’t ever mention it, but they talk about an ocean that’s rising, which will give you slightly more beachfront property if it happens. Now, think of it. But they don’t talk about somebody that’s got very evil intentions. Look at Iran. I stopped them from building a nuclear weapon, but this guy is going to give it up. He’s going to give it up. So, David McCormick. And I’ve known him for a long time, he’s an amazing man, a tremendous education, tremendous military background, and he’s a very strong guy, and he loves the state. I really hope you give him a chance.
(01:05:16)
It’s not easy. And I was just talking to him. A guy’s been in office for years. He’s done nothing. He’s done nothing. In that way, it’s good, but in another way, it’s tough because you’ve seen his name a little bit. You don’t even see his name. Most people don’t even know. If you asked, “Who are the senators?” they may choose the one that didn’t do so well in a debate but won, right? He didn’t do too well in a debate. I wonder who did worse in the debate, Biden or him? I think maybe Biden did. I think, actually-

Speaker 5 (01:05:48):

Fuck Joe Biden!

Donald J. Trump (01:05:49):

… he’s made more sense than a lot of other people over the last few months, in all fairness. He actually has. I commend him on that. But nobody knows about Casey. Nobody knows about him, even though he’s been there for years. His father was there for years. I just want to ask. It’s very important because we want to turn our country around. We need to get great representation even beyond the presidency. And this is a dead seat. It’s a seat that voted with this group of people, Barack Hussein Obama, and Biden, and her, because she was a part of it. She’s now trying to claim that she has nothing to do with Biden. She had nothing to do with the administration. They put him on. Now, maybe they change it, because I said this a couple of days ago. Usually, when I say something, they immediately change it so I can’t say it anymore, but they gave him speaking on Monday night. Now, have they changed it? I don’t think so. Monday night is considered, on a convention, Death Valley. It’s Death Valley, because people aren’t watching Monday night.
(01:06:52)
So, they deposed a president. It was a coup of a president. This was a coup. Nancy Pelosi, Crazy Nancy, she’s crazy as a bed bug, Crazy Nancy went in and laid it out. And she never thought he was good, because she’s smart, cunning, nasty, mean, but she’s crazy. And she went in and she said, “You’re getting out.” And he said, “No, I’m not. Only God will get me out.” Right? Isn’t that what he said? “Only God.”

Speaker 6 (01:07:23):

Yeah.

Donald J. Trump (01:07:24):

And within about 24 hours, he announced that he was going to get out. And he won it. He went through a primary system. She didn’t. He beat her in the primary. She ran along with 22 people. She ran. She was the first one out because she was no good. She was no good.

Speaker 7 (01:07:41):

[inaudible 01:07:42].

Donald J. Trump (01:07:42):

And now she’s running. And this is not what our country’s all about. And he feels terrible, and he’s a very angry man. I watched him yesterday. He’s a very angry man. I think he hates them more than he hates Donald Trump, and that’s hard to believe. I really do. He’s an angry man, and he should be an angry man. They walked in and they stole the presidency of the United States from him. Now, I think he was a terrible president. I think he was the worst president in the history of our country. I think that Jimmy Carter is the happiest man on Earth today. He’s not a young man. Because Jimmy Carter’s presidency was brilliant, brilliant by comparison to this. But she was a big part of it, and she’s going to be an even bigger part.
(01:08:27)
Now she wants to give her a whole country away. And just as Daniel and others have said, I mean, our country’s going to die, and yet it’s scary because she’s given so much away. I mean, who’s not going to vote to get some money for House? It’s never going to happen. It’s trillions of dollars. It’s never going to happen. But who’s going to vote? I mean, people will maybe vote for this. I said before, it may be good politics, but it’s going to destroy our country. The Washington Post, one of the most evil print journalism, I mean, they’ve lost a lot of people over the last couple of years, it’s nasty, they came out with an editorial excoriating her. Actually, I spoke with Jeff Bezos just for almost the first time. I met him once before. And he was so complimentary on the way we handled the horrible situation that took place recently, and I appreciated that. But we talked a little bit about the paper. And their radical left paper, they excoriated her in today’s editorial. Excoriated her. And I give The Washington Post tremendous credit.
(01:09:45)
I believe The New York Times did, or is about to do, the same thing. But when they’re going after somebody because they’re far, far… It’s not even left. Every single country that’s done this… It’s been done many times because it’s so easy to say, “I’m going to give you this. I’m going to give you that. We’re going to put price controls on food.” How do they do that? We’re going to say, “The beans are going to cost this. Cereal’s going to…” It doesn’t work. And what happens is you end up with huge inflation and no product because you can’t make it anymore, because they lose money hand over fist. So, it doesn’t work.
(01:10:22)
But it’s scary because sometimes people vote for it because it sounds good. It sounds good, but it’s really bad. We’re going to give you tax cuts. We’re going to give you additional tax cuts. We made our country wealthy. We made our country better than it had ever been before, and we did it. We did it. The big difference is we had a man serving for three and a half years with her at his side, and we had us. And prior, we did a great job on COVID, never got the credit. I got great credit for the economy, in all fairness to the fake news.
(01:11:03)
I got great credit for the economy, great credit for the military. We defeated ISIS. We had no new wars. We rebuilt our military. Think of that. We came up with a new and very important organization, to put it mildly, first time since the Air Force, almost 80 years, Space Force, and we took space, where we were languishing to China, falling way behind China and Russia, we took space, and now we’re dominating them. We put some incredible people in there. Space Force has been so important. It’ll end up being one of our truly important… Already is, I mean, it’s coordinating with… But we created Space Force.
(01:11:46)
We did so many things. Right to Try medically. Right to Try. If you’re terminally ill, you had no right to get medicine. Now you sign a document. They tried to get that for 58 years. 58 years they were unable to get it. I sat everybody down: the labs, the doctors, the insurance companies, and the country, because they didn’t want to be sued. Somebody’s terminally ill, they take something, they die, and then the family sues them for killing the mother, the father, the sister, the brother. And I said, “No, you’re going to sign a document, and you’re not going to sue anybody, but you’re going to go home, and you’re going to have the greatest drugs in the world that won’t be approved for another four or five years.” They’re terminally ill. And we have saved thousands and thousands of lives. Thousands.
(01:12:38)
So we did a lot, and we have a lot of other things planned. Oh, by the way, all of that great work done, we had the greatest lab technicians, the greatest doctors, the greatest laboratories in the world, all of that, under her system, gets wiped out. They’re close to a lot of great cures. I worked very hard on that. I also worked very hard on the FDA, getting them to bring it down, bring it down because it was going to take an average of 12 years to get something approved. I got it down to five. I wanted to get it down to two, but things have to happen. But we got it way, way down, and we came up with things.
(01:13:14)
And we have thousands of people that are living today that were considered terminally ill just a short while ago. It’s one of the things I’m most proud… It’s called Right to Try. And hopefully, nobody in this room needs it, but if you do, you don’t have to go to Asia. You don’t have to go to Europe. Or if you have no money, you go home and you die. That’s what happens. Mostly, people don’t have any hope. They go home and die. Now you have Right to Try, and thousands of people are living right now that would not be living.
(01:13:44)
We’re also pleased to be joined by a very special man, a friend of mine who’s been a warrior from day one, Dan Muser, Congressman Dan Meuser. Thank you, Dan. Great job. Mrs. Meuser, thank you. What a great job. Thank you. Thank you both for being here. No, I’m telling you, he’s been fantastic. A man who would defend me a lot on fake news, CNN. A former senator from your state, your Commonwealth, who was, frankly, a very talented man. He was very good on television. He spent most of his time defending me. Rick Santorum, former senator. Rick, thank you very much. I appreciate the defense. Thank you.
(01:14:37)
Former Congressman Fred Keller. Fred. Thank you very much, Fred. You look good. You look good. He looks good. Pennsylvania Treasurer Stacy Garrity. Thank you, Stacy. Great job you’re doing. The next congressman from Pennsylvania’s 8th Congressional District, Rob Bresnahan. Thank you, Rob. Good. Great primary win. I endorsed him. He went through. Great job. That was a big win. Candidate for the 7th Congressional District, Ryan Mackenzie. Ryan, thank you. Congratulations.
(01:15:23)
A man who we picked because, unlike a lot of states, including this one, we were leading by a lot, and then, all of a sudden, a miracle happened. We had another miracle happen about four weeks ago too, but this was a big miracle, and they found millions of votes. They found a lot of votes. But they didn’t do that in North Carolina where he was the head of the Republican Party. And I said, “Who is that guy?”
(01:15:51)
His name is Michael Whatley, and we appointed him the head of the RNC, the Republican National Committee, and he is doing a fantastic job. Really, really a great job. Thank you very much. He’s going to keep their cheating down to a minimum, right? Maybe nothing, but we know them better. They won’t stop. They won’t stop. We have an expression, “Too big to rig,” right? “Too big to rig.” And we’re leading by a lot, even though we now have to run against some… Think of it. I spend 100 million. Now I have to run against somebody else. Is that fair? I think they should reimburse me for the 100 million. Who wants to collect? Does anybody want to go and collect? I’ll get Front Row Joe to collect.
(01:16:41)
The mayor, who’s really a wonderful man, by the way. Mr. Mayor, it was good meeting you. Carl Curran. Thank you. Carl. Thank you very much. Thank you, Carl. Good man. New York’s Broome County DA, Paul Battisti. Paul Battisti. Thank you, Paul. Thank you. Good job you’re doing. I wish you were in Manhattan. We could use a good one in Manhattan. And Lackawanna County Commissioner Chris Chermak. Chris. Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Chris. Good job.
(01:17:23)
On my first day back in the Oval Office, I will immediately sign an executive order directing every cabinet secretary and agency head to use every power we have to drive prices down. But we’re going to drive them down in a capitalist way, not in a communist way. At the center of this effort will be to end Kamala’s war on American energy, and we will drill, baby, drill. We’re going to get your energy prices down. We’re going to get your energy prices down by 50%. The Kamala presidency will mean death for Pennsylvania energy. Remember that. It’ll mean death for Pennsylvania energy.
(01:18:07)
Kamala imposed a natural gas export ban to cripple Pennsylvania energy producers. You do know that she’s against this whole energy thing that you have going, which is by far the most important thing you have from an economic standpoint, a job standpoint. She’s against it. Kamala supports a carbon tax on the working class, and she’s vowed that she will ban fracking, which means 423, 000 plus at least 150,000 jobs beyond that. Pennsylvania is going to always be fracking because we desperately need the energy, and we desperately need the jobs. But she will end it. She will end it.
(01:18:48)
In addition, your state and local government will be starved of billions of dollars in oil and gas revenue, which means higher taxes, lower property values, worse schools, and plunging quality of life in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that I love. I’ve spent a lot of time here. I told you I went to school here, the Wharton School of Finance at Penn. Under my leadership, we will make America energy independent and energy dominant, and Pennsylvania energy workers will lead the way. You’re going to lead the way. It’s big stuff.
(01:19:22)
To further combat inflation, I will terminate Kamala Harris’s green new scam, it’s the greatest scam maybe ever played, and rescind all of the unspent funds. We’re going to take those unspent funds and use them for roads and bridges, and we’re going to give back a lot of money into the Treasury and pay down debt. To make both new and used cars more affordable, I will end the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate on day one, one of the most ridiculous things. One of the most ridiculous things. Kamala now claims to want to cut red tape, but in less than four years, she’s buried American families in regulations costing a typical household much more than $5,000 per year. Think of that. Just with their red tape.
(01:20:15)
I will cancel Kamala’s crushing regulatory onslaught, and I will immediately eliminate every costly job. Now, just so you know, I cut regulations more than any president in history by far. By far. So you can’t say to me, “Well, why didn’t you do it?” With me, you can’t say that on anything. I did do it, everything I said. They said, “Promises made, promises kept.” What I said, I kept, I mean, unless there was some crazy thing somewhere. But I got it done. I got it all done. Even the wall. I built hundreds of miles of wall. And I had to fight Congress. I had to fight the Senate like you wouldn’t believe. I built hundreds of miles of wall. And I ended up taking it out and winning in court. We had 11 lawsuits by mostly Democrats like Nancy Pelosi. We had 11 different… We won every one of them.
(01:21:11)
But think of it, I built the wall. I said, “I’m taking it out of the military because our country’s being invaded. This is an invasion of our country.” And we built hundreds of miles of wall. Then we built and had made an extra 200 miles that we were going to use to expand it further than I ever said, and it was made and ready to be installed, and we had a rigged election. And what happened after that was they didn’t want to do it, and they sold it for 5 cents on the dollar. 5 cents. Very sophisticated stuff, too.
(01:21:46)
To get economic relief to workers and families, I will make the Trump tax cuts permanent, and we will have no tax on tips, which she copied. She copied. You all know by now, she came out a few days ago, and she said, “There will be no tax on…” I said, “I said that months ago.” But here’s one that she hasn’t copied yet, to help seniors on fixed incomes who are suffering the ravages of horrible inflation caused by Crooked Joe and Kamala, there will be no tax on Social Security, so get out… And I get it done. I will get it done. They won’t. They haven’t even promised it to you, but they won’t get it done if they do. And I will always protect Social Security and Medicare for our great seniors, just as I did for four incredible years.
(01:22:46)
By contrast, Kamala Harris has a three-step plan to destroy Medicare and Social Security. She’s going to destroy your Medicare. She’s going to destroy your Social Security. First, she has thrown open our borders. Second, she is flooding our country with millions and millions of low-wage migrants and giving them welfare: free healthcare, food stamps, public benefits. And third, she wants to make them all citizens of the United States. Many of them coming from prison, many of them coming from mental institutions, and many are terrorists. She wants to make them citizens, dumping them onto Medicare, and dumping them into your beautiful Social Security program.
(01:23:34)
Remember, for four years, I saved Social Security. I never gave an increase. I never raised the age by five years, which is what they’re going to end up doing. With me, it’s staying the way it is. We have a lot of ways we’re making money. We don’t need to take it away from our seniors. The millions of illegal aliens pouring in under border czar… She was the border czar, right? She was the border czar. Now, about a month ago, she said, “I wasn’t

Donald J. Trump (01:24:00):

… wasn’t the border czar. She was the border czar. But it doesn’t matter. She was in charge of the border a hundred percent. But border czar Harris are coming in from the worst places, some of the most dangerous countries in the world. And as I said, they’re emptying out their jails and prisons and they’re emptying out their mental institutions and they’re dumping them into our country. What’s happening to our country is shocking. It’s unacceptable. And we have no choice. We’re going to do the largest deportation in the history of our country. We have no choice.
(01:24:46)
Just this week in Coney Island II, Kamala migrants were arrested for the rape of a 46-year-old woman, throwing her to the ground and raping her with a knife to her throat. She thought they were going to kill her. She said, “They weren’t looking to rape me. They were looking to kill me.” And it was a terrible thing. One of them had previously been arrested for raping another woman at a migrant shelter, but he was shielded from deportation by New York City sanctuary laws, which Kamala Harris strongly supported and doesn’t want to change. In Virginia, three weeks ago, a 54-year-old mother of four was leaving a 7/11 when she noticed an illegal alien trying to steal her car. When she tried to stop him, he ran her down and left her dead on the ground before going on to hit two more cars, killing two other drivers.
(01:25:45)
And in May, the leader of a Peruvian gang known as Los Killers, was released from border patrol custody and set free into America and Kamala’s direct orders, she said, “Set him free.” Meanwhile, he was wanted for 23 murders in Peru. Kamala refuses even to call these criminals, and we not going to use the term, she said, illegal aliens. No, they are illegal aliens, but she said, “Don’t ever use that term.” But they’re not just illegal aliens, honestly, they’re monsters. These are savage monsters. The Harris policy is to let thousands of migrant killers and rapists into our country. She was asked the other day, but she didn’t respond. We have detention centers where we have some of the worst criminals in the world in those detention centers from other countries and not just South America. They come from Africa, they come from Asia, they come from the Middle East.
(01:26:49)
They come from countries that are seriously crime ridden. And those countries, the crimes are going way down like Venezuela. We talked about Venezuela or before, and think about Venezuela. Their crime is down 72%. They’ve gone to Caracas and they’ve gone to different places in Venezuela. They’ve taken their murderers, their drug dealers, their rapists, their thugs and they’ve taken them out of the country. They’ve said, “You’re going to the United States of America and if you come back, we will kill you.” And they are now living with us. All will be criminals soon. And don’t forget, they’re just getting used to the experience of being in a country where criminals are treated better, far better than the people that are being hurt and victimized. And when they see that and they’re going to have levels of crime, I call it migrant crime, we’ll call it Kamala migrant crime. She destroyed San Francisco.
(01:27:51)
She destroyed Los Angeles. I call it migrant crime. She had something that she went with. You’re not a criminal. It’s a very minor offense if you steal anything from a store that’s less than $950, did you know that? So guys are walking into stores with… They walk into stores with a calculator, keep it under 950 and nothing’s going to happen. By the way, if it goes to 9,050, nothing happens either. What’s happened in California with Governor Newsom and guys like this, people like this is terrible. But Kamala, what environment, what a beautiful place, what a great place. The weather is so beautiful, the ocean, everything’s beautiful. It’s crime ridden and horrible and changes have to be made. The Trump policy is to keep these savage criminals the hell out of our country. They’re going to be out of our country. If Kamala wins, you’ll have mass amnesty and citizenship for all. She wants to give all of these people citizenship.
(01:28:57)
In Venezuela, their crime is down 72%. In other countries all over the world, their crime is way down. And in our country, wait till you see the real numbers because they’re not counting migrant crime, which is going to make our crime look like baby stuff. If I win, you will have the largest operation of police to take care of us. They have to take care of us. They want to take care of us. They want to do their job. As border patrol wants to do their job and it’s going to start on inauguration day, January 20th, 2025. It’s going to start immediately. They want to do their job and we don’t let them. And if they do their job and if they’re a little bit strong about doing their job, they’re dealing with a lot of very tough people. They take away their pension, they take away their job, they lose their family, they lose their house, they lose everything. They end up in squalor. And we’re not going to do that. We’re going to defend our great local police and law enforcement.
(01:30:09)
In general, we’re going to defend them. We’re going to defend them. We want them to protect us and we’re going to need them much more than ever before because the criminals pouring into our country by the millions. I believe the real number is over 20 million people. You don’t hear that. 10 million, 12 million, even if it was, it’s still so many. But the real number is over 20 million people. That’s larger than New York state. Kamala Harris wants to eliminate private health insurance and give free taxpayer funded healthcare to every single illegal alien in the country. And then you wonder why do they come up? You know why they come up? Because guys like Newsom and others are saying, “Come up, come to our country. We’ll give you healthcare.” You know what they’re doing to your school system is incredible. People are taking the seats of your children. Your children can’t go to school.
(01:31:04)
And you have people taking their seats that don’t speak a word of English, come from a foreign country and your kids aren’t getting educated. Your kids are not getting educated. They’re considered like secondary citizens. And this is Kamala and Joe to a lesser extent. Look, Joe, Joe’s lost. He’s forget him. By contrast, I’m going to keep the Affordable Care Act unless we can do something much better. We’ll keep it, but we can do much better. It’s too expensive for the people. They can’t afford it. It’s lousy healthcare. If we can do something better, we’re working on it. If we can do something better, but we will never let anybody touch it unless we have something better. We’re going to deliver lower prices, lower drug costs, and new options that will dramatically reduce the crushing burden on all American patients.
(01:31:55)
And Kamala and Crooked Joe, they try and take credit for $35 insulin, but I was the one that did the $35 insulin, not them. Just kicked in during their administration. I remember a couple of years, a few years ago, I said, “Boy, oh boy.” They said, “Sir, this will kick in over the next two and a half, three years.” I said, “What about now?” You couldn’t do it, just to process. I said, “I hope I win the presidency because I want to get credit for that.” But he gets up there, “Oh, we got $35.” I got it. Kamala Harris’, Democrat Party is the party of healthcare for illegals. The Republican Party is the party of common sense. We really are the party of common sense ultimately.
(01:32:44)
So we will bring back our supply chain, the supply chains, and they’ve been so devastated. Our supply chains are… You order something and they say, “Sir, that’ll be four months.” And then four months comes up and they say it’s going to be another four months. It’s stuck at sea. They have no idea where the hell it is. But we’re going to bring them back from China and other foreign countries ending costly supply chain disruptions. And they are really bad. There is bad now as they were… But we get used to it. We’re living like a third-world country. Who thought? As we reduce burdens on domestic manufacturers, American workers will make our critical goods better and cheaper right here in the USA and right here in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. And I will, with David, revoke China’s most favored nation’s trade status. They have a huge advantage. Because they are a growing nation. Well, we’re a growing nation too. We’re a nation that is crippled. We are a horribly crippled nation. And China gets all of these advantages in trade because they consider themselves to be a growing nation. Well, we’re a growing nation too. And I did that already. I will pass what will be known as the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act. If China or any other country makes us pay 100 or 200% tariff, we will make them pay a reciprocal tariff of 100 or 200% right back. You hurt us, we hurt you. It’s called an eye for an eye. I will also restore peace through strength and I will prevent World War III from happening. We will stop it. When crooked, Hillary Clinton was running against me. She said, “Look at him. Listen to him. He will start a war, a world war.”
(01:34:43)
We had no wars other than I defeated Isis in its entirety, 100% of the ISIS caliber. “Listen to his rhetoric. Listen to his horrible tone.” I said that horrible tone is going to keep people from fighting us, and that’s what happened. We had no wars. It’s been 81 years since that happened for a president. No wars other than ending some wars that we are in and defeating ISIS. Two days ago, I watched a parade of the Taliban in Afghanistan. Did you see it? The Taliban were… They were showing all of our equipment that they took from America, $85 billion worth, two days ago, celebrating three years of the defeat of America by these guys. And I knew them very well. Abdul was the head. Abdul was not playing games with me. They were executing a lot of our soldiers. And I spoke to him. I said, “Abdul, don’t do it anymore. There’ll be no more.”
(01:35:47)
Anyway, I said it pretty tough. And you know what? For 18 months we didn’t have one American soldier killed in Afghanistan. And then I left. And then I left. And this bunch of incompetent people took over and it all started up again. And then they had the most embarrassing day in the history of our country, I thought. But she bragged about being the last person in the room that night, the night that they decided to do whatever they decided to do. In other words, she had the final vote and she bragged about it. It’s been the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan. It should have never, ever happened. We should have gotten out with dignity and strength.
(01:36:36)
And you don’t take your military out first. You take your military out last. They couldn’t believe we did it. Under Trump, we will have no more wars, no more disruptions, and we will have prosper and peace for all. And again, we’re going to bring back that American dream for all of the young people in this audience and some of the old ones. This is how we will end the era of inflation, mayhem and misery under Kamala and crooked Joe Biden and unleash safety, prosperity, and promise for Americans of every race, religion, color and creed. Every single one of them are going to understand peace and wealth. And we’re going to be a dominant force again. We’re going to be respected as a country again. Right now, we’re being laughed at that
(01:37:27)
Together we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates, low inflation. We had almost no inflation during my four years, almost nothing. And they went up to nine and a half percent. And that number’s a fake number because they don’t add the worst categories. It was much higher than that. But it was record setting inflation that everyone can… We’re going to make sure… Afford your groceries, afford a car, afford a home, low interest rates. We’re going to get it all down. We will stop the invasion. We will end migrant crime. We’ll support our great police. We will strengthen our military, build a missile defense shield over the top of our country, an iron dome. It’ll be a great iron dome and much of it will be made right here in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
(01:38:24)
Why shouldn’t we have that? Why shouldn’t we have that? Other countries can have it, but we can’t. It was our idea. Ronald Reagan wanted it many years ago. But then in all fairness, you didn’t have the technology. Today, you do. We’re going to have an iron dome to protect us from the lunatics out there And we’re going to keep critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools and we are going to keep men out of women’s sports. No men in women’s sports. Did you see in the Olympics? They had two transitioned. They transitioned. They were men. They transitioned to women and they were in the boxing.
(01:39:24)
And a young Italian woman was boxing one of the transitioned men. And she got hit with a jab. Just boom. A jab is not like the hard… This is the harder one, right? If you’re right-handed. Boom. And she backed up. She said, “What just hit me. I just got hit with a horse. What just hit me?” Think of that. Then he did it again. Boom. And she said, “Okay, that’s enough.” Two jabs. Then the other one… And by the way, he went on to easily win the gold medal. He just walked through everybody. He won the gold medal. Then there was another one, a transitioned man, and he also won the gold medal. He transitioned and he won the gold medal very easily.
(01:40:13)
So the two fighters won the gold medals very easily. And she came out, the Italian girl, beautiful girl, very good boxer. And she said, “Nobody’s ever hit me like that.” Two jabs. She said, “I’ve never been hit.” She just said, “That’s enough. That’s enough.” It’s crazy. It’s so demeaning to women. How about the weightlifting? Hundreds of pounds more hundreds. Records that haven’t been broken in 18 years. One eighth of an ounce here, one eighth of an ounce. And they can’t do it. You could do it. They can’t do it. And a guy comes out, excuse me, a transitioned person. How much more is that? Oh, that’s 128 pounds more. How crazy is this? Our country has gone crazy and we’re going to put it back on track. We are the party of common sense.
(01:41:09)
We will defend the Second Amendment, restore free speech, and we will secure our elections. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive. We’re going to be a thriving country again. And every day we’ll be filled with joy, opportunity, and hope. Right now, it’s filled with sorrow. It’s sorrow. People are so embarrassed by what’s happening to our country. They’re waiting for Iran to drop weapons all over Israel. But it hasn’t happened. You know why? Because our country is willing to pay them billions and billions of dollars. How about where they negotiate? I had 58 people, we negotiated and we didn’t pay. 58 hostages I got out. 59 I think, and got them out even from North Korea, the toughest. Had a good relationship with Kim Jong-Un. But I got them out. But you never pay because once you pay, you got to pay. How about we pay $6 billion, 6 billion and we get some out.
(01:42:14)
And in the case of Russia, they get the Prince of Doom. You know who the Prince of… The greatest arms dealer, they say in the history of the world and they got him. And we also gave $6 billion. It’s so embarrassing. And the world is watching. And when you pay $6 billion, all of a sudden people are going to be disappearing from the streets all over the place. And it’s a very bad precedent is being set in many ways, including the weaponization of our government. I could have done that with Hillary Clinton. And I said to myself, “How would it look? We’re trying to unify the country. How would it look if I had arrested and put in prison the wife of the President of the United States?” I thought it was not good. And then they do that to me. They want to put me away. But you know what? I get indicted for you. To me, I’m just here. I’m just standing in their way.
(01:43:17)
I said to them, “Fellas, you know…” I was no fan of Hillary, but I said, “How would it look if we put her in prison? We’re going to put Hillary Clinton, the wife and a Secretary of State. We’re going to put her in prison?” But we never did this stuff. And then I came along. It’s double standard. They do. They want to do it to me. So far, they’ve been very unsuccessful. But they would like to. We must defeat Kamala Harris and we must stop her country destroying liberal agenda liberal like nobody’s ever seen in the history of our country. So get your friends, get your family register, volunteer. Get out and vote and vote for that guy right there, David.
(01:44:06)
The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020 and we not going to allow them to rig the presidential election in 2024. And we want a landslide. Not going to let it happen. We’re not going to have a country left. You need two things to start. You need a strong, beautiful, fair border and you need fair and free elections. And we have neither, right? We have neither. On November 5th, we will save our economy. We will rescue our middle class. We will reclaim our sovereignty and restore our borders. We will put America first and we will fight, fight, fight. We’re going to fight. We’re going to fight for our country.
(01:45:18)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. But this is a very consequential commonwealth as we say. But this is a very consequential vote in Pennsylvania because they say that if you win Pennsylvania, you’re going to win the whole thing. We cannot let these people win Pennsylvania. That includes David. Can’t let it happen. And together we will make America powerful again. We’re going to make it powerful, powerful. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. We will make America free again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, Pennsylvania.

Donald Trump (00:54):

A big hello to North Carolina, thank you very much. It’s great to be back in this beautiful state with the proud, hard-working patriots who make our country run. You really do. You built our country, you make our country run. I want to thank a very good man, and he’s in there fighting, he’s fighting, and we know he’s a fighter. The next governor of North Carolina, Mark Robinson. Thanks, Mark. Mrs. Robinson, thank you. They’re a great, great couple. Thank you both. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Audience (01:49):

We love Trump! We love Trump! We love Trump! We love Trump! We love Trump! We love Trump! We love Trump! We love Trump! We love Trump!

Donald Trump (01:50):

Thank you very much. That is a very frisky group, I have to say. And by the way, we have some very good polls coming out today, I just heard, despite all of the fake publicity about this radical left person from San Francisco. How’s San Francisco doing? Not like North Carolina. No, we have some very good polls coming out, so that’s good. Considering the fact that, what they do… I mean what they do, what the fake news is able to do, and yet we’re leading, and let them have their convention, and who knows how that’s going to turn out.

Audience (02:34):

We love you, Trump!

Donald Trump (02:35):

Joe Biden is a very angry man. You know that, right? Because they took it away from him. They usurped it. They took it away from him. Terrible, terrible.

Audience (02:47):

We love you!

Donald Trump (02:47):

And I’m not sure that they picked the right guy in him, but he got 14 million votes. He got 14 million votes. You got no votes, and you look at what happens. That’s not the way it’s supposed to happen. They’re a threat to democracy, right? As they say. They are a threat to democracy.
(03:02)
But thanks as well to members of Congress, Chuck Edwards, and Virginia Foxx. Warriors. Thank you, wherever you may be. Ah! Good, thank you. Thanks, Chuck. Thank you, Virginia. State Auditor candidate, Dave Boliek. He said, “I’m only in politics for you, sir. I only…” Where is Dave? Anybody that would save… Dave, if you say that and if you… Do you mean that?

Dave Boliek (03:28):

I mean it!

Donald Trump (03:29):

If you mean that, I’m for you all the way, he has my endorsement. Thank you, Dave. A man who’s doing an incredible job, so good. When we won this state, and we won it easily, I said, “Michael Whatley, you’re going to head the RNC with Lara.” With Lara. And they’re doing an incredible, incredible job. And also, your North Carolina GOP Chairman, Jason Simmons. Jason, thank you. We’re doing okay? We’re doing good, Jason? Okay, we’re way up here. We got to make sure everyone gets out and votes, but we’re way up, so I want to thank you. We’ve had a tremendous experience here. We won every time we’re in this special place.

We love you, Trump!

Donald Trump (04:12):

My son, he and his wonderful wife, you know who I’m talking about. Lara.

Audience (04:19):

Lara!

Donald Trump (04:20):

Lara. But Eric and Lara, they named their beautiful daughter Carolina. Okay? I said, “Which one are you talking about?” Today I’m going to say it’s North Carolina, right? No, she was born here, raised here, and I’m sure it’s a big reason we’ve done so well here. She’s great. She’s really terrific, and he is a great young man. I’m a little prejudiced, perhaps, because he’s my son. A little bit. But they’re a great couple, and thank you very much. We appreciate it.
(04:58)
With the help of everyone in this room, 83 days from now, can you imagine, 83 days? We’re almost there! We got to get it. We’re going to defeat super liberal, more liberal than Bernie Sanders, did you hear that? The most liberal person in the Senate. Can you believe that? We’re going to defeat Kamala Harris, we’re going to win back the White House in a historic landslide, and we’re going to take back our country. We’re going to take it back. And I think it’s important to say, and I never get corrected, I know it’s fact because you know if I’m slightly off, they do headlines. “He didn’t tell quite the truth.” We are leading the biggest political movement in the history of our country, bigger than any movement ever before. There’s never been a movement like this. It’s called Make America Great Again, MAGA. Make America Great again. I say to the Democrats when they come out, “We’ve got to try and stop MAGA.” MAGA is Make America Great Again, what do you want to stop it for? That’s what we’re doing. They put in a candidate and we beat him, badly.

Audience (06:22):

I love you, Donald Trump!

Donald Trump (06:23):

How did he do in the debate? Then they put in another candidate. This is like you have two fighters, and one guy loses, they say, ” Come on out. Let’s put in another one.” So, then they put in another candidate, and we’re doing very well, considering the fact that she has the greatest press. She went from being a totally disrespected person six weeks ago, nobody thought she had a chance, nobody. And I don’t think she can possibly win. If she does, our country’s finished, you want to know the truth. But she was totally disrespected, the most unpopular vice president in the history of our country, and then they decided to get politically correct. “We have to put her in.” They put her in. And now they’re putting her on the covers of Time Magazine with an artist sketch. They don’t use a picture. They don’t use a picture, they use an artist sketch. I want to use that artist. I want to find that artist, I like him very much.
(07:23)
But we’re going to beat her also, and they may then get a third candidate, who knows? This is a little bit different than we’re supposed to be doing. You’re supposed to have a candidate. We spent probably $100 million on beating him, then we had a very good debate and we beat him and they said, instead of letting it go… Who knows what happens, right? It’s the world of politics. They say, “We want him out. Joe, you’re getting out now, Joe.” “I don’t want to get out. I have 14…” “You’re getting out now, Joe. We can do it the nice way or we can do it the hard way.”
(07:56)
And he’s getting out. He’s getting out. In fact, they’re not even giving him a good spot to speak. You know when he’s speaking? On Monday. Monday’s not… That’s the worst day. But that’s what they do, and it’s their own form of… It’s just another, I guess relatively, it’s a minor form of cheating by comparison to what they really do, right? Everything Kamala Harris touches turns bad. It all turns bad. San Francisco was a great city; now it’s unlivable. California was a great state; now it’s unlivable. She breaks everything, just like she broke the border, broke our economy. But soon, we are going to fix every single problem Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have created, and we are going to save our country. We are going to save America. We’re going to save America.
(08:47)
Now, this is a little bit different day because this isn’t around, we’re talking about a thing called the economy. They wanted to do a speech on the economy. A lot of people are very devastated by what’s happened with inflation and all of the other things, so we’re doing this as a “intellectual speech”. We’re all intellectuals today. Today we’re doing it, and we’re doing it right now, and it’s very important. They say it’s the most important subject. I think crime is right there, I think the border is right there, personally. We have a lot of important subjects because our country has become a third world nation. We literally are a third world nation. We’re a banana republic, in so many ways, and we’re not going to let that happen, because we’re starting a free fall.
(09:32)
But from today, and from the day I take the oath of office, we will rapidly drive prices down, and make America affordable again. We’re going to make it affordable again. Under Kamala Harris and Crooked Joe Biden, the American dream is dead. You don’t hear about the American dream anymore, it’s dead. Her radical liberal policies have caused horrific inflation, decimated the middle class, and gutted the finances of millions and millions of American families. Real incomes are down by over $2,000 a year per family. That’s a lot of money. They’re down by that, and it’s actually much more, if you figure it a certain way, if you add some other categories in, it’s much more than that. But down by $2,000 since she took office. And it was just announced that real earnings were down once again, at a record rate. The Harris price hikes have cost the typical household $28,000. Congratulations. Hope everyone’s happy?

Audience (10:38):

Boo!

Donald Trump (10:42):

Credit card debt has exploded, and it’s exploded to the highest it’s ever been, and the cost of a typical monthly mortgage has tripled. Tripled. And probably more than that, if you think about it. We were at about 2.4%, and now you’re up to 10% and even 11%, but you’re really not there because you can’t get the money, even if you want to pay it. In July alone, 350,000 people were added to the unemployment rolls.
(11:08)
Kamala Harris wants to talk about her fantasies, and they are fantasies. Everything she says. If I say something, she said, that’s what she’s going to do too. I say, “What are you doing?” But she wants to talk for the future about these fantasies, but really what she needs to explain is the present suffering that she’s caused, along with Joe Biden. And by the way, they’re a team. She’s trying to throw him overboard, she doesn’t want to know who he is anymore. She doesn’t want to talk about him anymore. She says, “Let’s not bring this guy in. Let’s not bring him in.” No, no, they were a team. He appointed her as border czar and she did the worst job in the history of borders, I will tell you. Does anyone here feel richer under Kamala Harris-

Audience (11:52):

No!

Donald Trump (11:53):

… and Crooked Joe than you were during the Trump administration? Is anything less expensive under Kamala Harris and Crooked Joe?

Audience (12:02):

No!

Donald Trump (12:04):

We had inflation that… I don’t believe we’ve ever had inflation like that. You can go back a long way. Are you better off now-

Audience (12:11):

No!

Donald Trump (12:12):

… with Harris and Biden than you were with a person named-

Audience (12:15):

No!

Donald Trump (12:16):

… President Donald J. Trump? Do you know him? He’s a nice gentleman. Nice gentleman. With four more years of Harris, your finances will never recover. They’re never going to recover. Our country will never recover, frankly, more importantly. It will be unrecoverable. Vote Trump and your incomes will soar, your savings will grow, young people will be able to afford a home, and we will bring back the American dream bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. Thank you.

Audience (12:49):

Yes, we will!

Donald Trump (12:49):

Thank you.

Audience (12:49):

Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump!

Donald Trump (12:49):

Thank you very much.

Audience (12:49):

Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump!

Donald Trump (12:55):

Thank you. Look at this, we have a lot of front row Joes here. Wow. Oh Lord, what a great group of patriots they are. I don’t know, they’ve gone to, I think 219 or 220? And this isn’t rally, but this is a different kind of a thing. Today we’re going to talk about one subject, and then we’ll start going back to the other, because we sort of love that, don’t we? But it’s an important… No, it’s an important, they say it’s the most important subject. I’m not sure it is, but they say it’s the most important. Inflation is the most important, but that’s part of economy. Kamala Harris wants to be in charge of the entire US economy, but neither she nor her running mate… He’s another beauty, isn’t he? He signed a bill, he wants tampons in boys’ bathrooms. I don’t think so. Tampons. But they’ve never held a private sector job in their entire professional careers, and it’s no wonder they’re both socialists. They’re actually beyond socialists, I think they skipped over socialists. That’s why I think when people find out, because you don’t know who these people are, I think when people find out who they are, I personally don’t think they can do well in the election. They’ve destroyed this country. What they’ve done, when you look at San Francisco, what happened to… And she was the one that started it. Years ago, she was district attorney, then she was the attorney general of the state of California. California is a disaster now. Now, Gavin Newsom hasn’t helped very much, but it’s a disaster. She was the one.
(14:43)
This November, voters are going to give radical liberal Kamala Harris the opportunity to try something new; a real job in the private sector for the first time in her life. Nice. Kamala has declared that tackling inflation will be a day one priority. Just think of it. For her, but day one for Kamala was three and a half years ago. Why hasn’t she done it? I keep saying, “Ah, she’s one of these complainers, like a critic.”
(15:16)
I remember growing up, I’d see plays on Broadway and I’d go to different things, and you’d always have critics. They’d criticize. But I’d see, and they were critical, critical, but they never did it themselves. She’s a critic, that’s all she is, she never did anything, nothing that she ever did worked. When Kamala lays… And she got lucky with this, she was the first one out. 22 people, I guess, I hear, I just asked. I said, “That many?” A lot of people. She never made it to Iowa, the great state of Iowa. She was the first one out. She had a lack of skill and people didn’t like her, and now she’s running for president? Then she never got one vote. Think about that.
(15:55)
When Kamala lays out her fake economic plan this week probably will be a copy of my plan, because basically that’s what she does. Just remember, she goes to work every morning in the West Wing, her desk is 10 steps from the Oval Office. She cast the tie-breaking votes that gave us record inflation, and for nearly four years, Kamala has crackled as the American economy has burned. What happened to her laugh? I haven’t heard that laugh in about a week. That’s why they keep her off the stage. That’s why she’s disappeared. That’s the laugh of a crazy person, I will tell you. If you haven’t noticed, it’s a crazy… She’s crazy. They told her, “Don’t laugh! Don’t laugh.” No. No, her laugh is career-threatening. They said, “Don’t laugh.” She hasn’t laughed. She doesn’t laugh anymore. It’s smart, but someday it’s going to come out. That’s the laugh of a person with some big problems.
(16:56)
She says her plan is going to bring down prices, she thinks she’s going to bring down prices. Then why, here’s a simple little few words, why didn’t you do it, Kamala? Why didn’t you do it? You’ve been there three and a half years. Why aren’t you doing it now? You can do it right now.
(17:18)
I can say that with everything. Why hasn’t she secured the border? You know she was the border czar, right? She was the border czar. It was a big deal. She says now, she wasn’t the border czar. That’s okay. She was in charge of the border. Call it whatever you want, but she was in charge, and this was the worst border in history. There’s never been a border in the world like this. Why hasn’t she brought back the jobs? Why? She talks about jobs. “We’re going to come up with a new plan.” She’s been there for three and a half years with a man who, frankly, she defrauded the public, because she didn’t tell you about that man. I exposed him during the debate, thank you very much. Thank you. And now the bombs are starting to drop in the Middle East. You see what’s going on there, right? That would’ve never happened. Israel would’ve never happened, Ukraine would’ve never happened with Russia. You wouldn’t have ever had an embarrassment like that Afghanistan disaster. Worst, most embarrassing day in our country’s history. Inflation would’ve never happened. It was caused by a very stupid energy policy. Then he went back to my policy, because prices were going up so much. But it’ll end. If they won this election on day one, all of that would end, and this country will go through hell, and it can never come back. Once it goes, it’s pretty far down already. I’m going to have to work very hard. It’s pretty far down. When you let 20 million people come into our country, from places unknown, and from prisons and from mental institutions and terrorists, Kamala Harris won’t end the economic crisis, she will only make it worse. And why hasn’t she done it? She talks about it. She’s doing a plan. She’s going to announce it this week, maybe. She’s waiting for me to announce it, so she can copy it.
(19:27)
Remember a couple of days ago? “And we will have no tax on tips.” I said, “That was my plan!” Not only didn’t she… They came up with a plan to go after all these people violently, then one day she just uttered that sound. But she’ll copy a lot of other things, too. But she’ll never do them. She’ll never do them. She’ll say them for the election, but she’ll never do them. She can’t solve the problem because she is the problem, she really is. People like her. When I left office, I handed

Donald Trump (20:00):

… Kamala and crooked Joe Biden, a surging economy with no inflation. The thirty-year mortgage rate was 2.4%. Gasoline had reached $1 and 87 cents a gallon, and for periods of time was even lower than that. The African-American poverty rate was down 7%. The Hispanic-American poverty rate was down 8%. The biggest drops, the greatest drops that you’ve ever seen in this country. They’ve never had it so well. Nobody has. Every group, every group, men, women, Hispanics, Asians, Blacks, everybody was down at a level that nobody’s ever seen. We had some of the greatest periods of economic growth and health that any country has ever seen. I think probably more than any country has ever seen. In four short years under President Trump, we passed the largest tax cuts in history, the largest regulation cuts in history. We unleashed American energy and real income surge by more than $4,200 in just a short number of months.
(21:07)
I mean, it was nobody… You never had it so good. Now you’re not doing so well. We had the strongest economy in history. There has never been a country that had an economy like us. I gave Harris and Biden an economic miracle and they quickly turned it into an economic nightmare with a nation-wrecking agenda ripped straight out of Kamala’s San Francisco liberal playbook, what they’ve done to poor San Francisco. Well, we’re going to try and bring that back too. Harris and Biden waged war on American energy threw open our borders, flooded the country with low-wage migrant workers, passed the green new scam, racked up almost $10 trillion in debt, and buried our workers in job-killing regulations costing $10,000 per family. That’s a lot of money. You don’t have to imagine what a Harris presidency would look like. You’re living through the misery right now, except it will get worse.
(22:07)
And you’re paying the price, a price like nobody’s ever paid, and we’re disrespected all over the world as a country. We were respected before. Putin respected us. President Xi of China respected us. Kim Jong-un of North Korea respected us. We were respected by everybody in the world. Today, we’re being laughed at. Today, we’re being laughed at all over the world. You’re paying the price for Kamala’s liberal extremism at the gas pump, at the grocery counter, and on your mortgage bill and on everything else. How about your car insurance? How’s that doing? Not too good. I saw today it’s up like 82%. We’re not going to let this incompetent socialist lunatic keep breaking our economy for four more years. It’ll destroy country. On election day, we’re going to tell her that we’ve had enough, that we can’t take it anymore, Kamala. You’re doing a horrible job. You are a terrible attorney general. You are a terrible district attorney. You’re the worst vice president in history. Kamala, you are fired. Get out of here. Go get out of here. Get out.
(23:30)
Thank you. Thank you very much. That was not a pleasant day. I’ll tell you, Front Row Joes were there. Front Row Joes were there. They were. They’ve seen it all, haven’t you? Huh? You’ve seen it. That was a horrible day. That was a terrible day. She’s flip-flopping on every single thing she’s ever espoused or believed in, the border, healthcare, crime. But she truly is a radical. She’s flip-flopping on everything to get elected. After she gets elected, it all goes right back to where it was. She refuses to do any interviews or press conferences, almost 30 days. Now she hasn’t done an interview. You know why she hasn’t done an interview? Because she’s not smart, she’s not intelligent. And we’ve gone through enough of that with this guy, Crooked Joe. He didn’t do interviews either. They kept him in his basement and essentially they’re keeping her in the basement the same way they kept him.
(24:45)
They don’t want to expose her to like a question, like, “What did you have for dinner tonight?” Remember Joe? “What kind of ice cream is your favorite” “Vanilla.” “Oh, I like vanilla.” That was George Flopidopoulos asked him that. “What’s your favorite ice cream?” With me, they asked me a little bit different question. That’s all right. Did everybody the other night see Elon and me? He’s great. That was one of the most successful shows ever have done. I mean, that was… A lot of people like him. I think they like me too, come to think of it. But he’s great and he gave us his full endorsement and he is a great guy, but basically, he’s a guy… Doesn’t need this stuff. What he wants to do is see our country be great again. And he understands and it’s very hard for him to endorse the opposing party. It’s not easy. It’s very hard.
(25:43)
But he really cares about our country and he knows the opposing party really destroyed our country and will destroy our country and permanently destroy our country. And he can’t watch that. But we had a great chat for two and a half hours. Two and a half hours being grilled by Elon, and we had a good time actually. We’re talking about something we love, our country. Much easier when you love something. She doesn’t want anybody to know what she’s really for, and that way she could change it. I mean, she’ll tell you what she wants and change it the way she wants it, and ultimately it’ll be the way she wants it. I mean, the clown that she picked as a vice president, this guy’s a clown. He was so bad. When Minneapolis was burning down, he didn’t want to call in the National Guard. I got him on the phone. “You got to get the National Guard. Get it, get it, get it.”
(26:42)
I’m telling you, if I didn’t force it upon him, you might not have the city. Remember CNN standing up, “This is a season of love. This is a very peaceful protest.” And the whole city is burning down behind them. You ever see anything as far as I could see, the whole thing, it looked like World War II. Speaking of World War III, I’ll keep you out of World War III. He’s going to put you in World War III. We’re very close. You’re very close to being in a war, a big war, a world war. You’re very close. We’ve never been this close, and we have incompetent people in the White House, grossly incompetent people. There was no reason for Russia and Ukraine to go at it. There was no reason for Israel to be attacked on October 7th. Would’ve never happened.
(27:33)
But a politician will always go back to where they started. And on November 6th, she will be a San Francisco liberal again, destroying everything in sight. I wonder what she does after this. Our country will never recover, especially when added to the destruction they’ve already caused over the last almost four years. Think of our country, think of the border. Think of what happened. We had the best border, my favorite, my all-time favorite graph. That is my all-time favorite graph. Not only because it shows the best border, but for another reason. I tell you what, I’m glad I looked around to look at it. I go, “Wah pew.” That’s my favorite of all time. Even if it was… Thank you, thank you. Thank you very much. Even if it were bad numbers, negative numbers, I still think it would be my favorite of all time. If Harris wins this election, the result will be a Kamala economic crash, a 1929 style depression. 1929. When I win the election, we will immediately begin a brand new Trump economic boom. It’ll be a boom. We’re going to turn this country around so fast. Many people say that the only reason the stock market is up is because people think I am going to win. Did you ever hear that? But there was one day a couple of weeks ago when they weren’t thinking that and you saw what happened. This will be in 1929 style crash. I have one of the most brilliant men in Wall Street, I think here. I shook hands with them just a little while ago. Scott. Where’s Scott? Where’s Scott?
(29:35)
Oh, stand up. This man. Will you come up here? Please just come up here for a moment. He is considered one of the most brilliant men on Wall Street, and he’s made certain statements. I’d like him to make them because probably I’d be better off if he made them than me. But I do agree with him. But no, he’s considered one of the greatest on all of Wall Street respected by everybody, and I’m not sure he can get through Secret Service. It’s gotten very tight. Come on up, Scott. Come on up. Come on up, Scott. Come on up here. Look at him. And he’s a nice looking guy too. You want to say a couple of words? Come on.

Scott (30:23):

Look, this is the Trump economy. This is the Trump stock market, and I can tell you that it will be… Kamala Harris will start with the Kamala crash in the stock market, and then it will be the Kamala crash in the economy. And I don’t think that’s going to happen. I am convinced that President Trump is ahead in the polls now. He’s going to stay ahead in the polls and that he may beat Kamala Harris by more than he would’ve beaten President Biden.

Donald Trump (30:58):

Thanks, Scott. Thank you, Scott. Thank you. Is he central casting? He’s central casting. Thank you. Now he’s been very strong on that. He said that if they get in, you’re going to have a 1929 style crash. He’s been very strong on it, but others have said that too, and we don’t want that to happen to our country. That would be devastating for you, for everybody. On my first day back in the Oval Office, I will sign an executive order directing every cabinet secretary and agency head to use every tool and authority at their disposal to defeat inflation and to bring consumer prices rapidly down. We’ll do it very rapidly. When you look at the cost of groceries, the cost of bacon where it went up four and five times. Bacon. I don’t know what her bacon anymore. It’s too expensive.
(31:49)
It’ll be a whole-of-government effort to the standard of living and make American life affordable again. It’s going to really be a very important thing, because it’s not affordable. Even if you’re doing a little bit better, you’ve lost all of your money because of inflation. It’s been out of control for a long time. And don’t forget now, eventually it’s starting to maybe get under control, but you’re already up 50, 60, 70% in so many items. You look at car insurance. I couldn’t believe when I looked at those numbers this morning, I was studying numbers and I looked at the car insurance numbers. It’s incredible. And that’s just one of many. You can go through many, but the groceries, just to put it in simple terms, people go to the grocery store and they have less than half a deal. In fact, I had something here. I did have something I would show you. Wait a minute. I don’t know if you’ve seen this. I used it once. Oh, I have it. I do have it. Look at this. Look at this. So this is Tic Tacs, right?
(32:51)
I don’t know if I liked the company. I’ve never met. I have no idea. They’re so lucky. Look at all the television. This is the greatest commercial they ever had, but that’s what happened. This is inflation. This is Tic Tac, this is Tic Tac. This is inflation. This is what’s happened. I just happened to have… Somebody gave me this one today. I said, “I think we’ll put it up as an example of inflation.” But you know what? Inflation is destroying our country. It’s destroying our families. We will target everything from car affordability to housing affordability, to insurance costs, to supply chain issues. We have the worst supply chain we’ve ever had in the history of the country. To the price of prescription drugs, I will instruct my cabinet that I expect results within the first 100 days or much sooner than that.
(33:49)
I would say the first seven days is fine. Car insurance is up 70 to 100% and you can’t get it. You can’t even get it. Do you agree with that? You can’t even get it. They tell me. Insurance is up 50% or higher. The whole industry is out of control. The insurance industry has never been anything through… We have never been in a situation with insurance like it is right now. You can’t get it no matter what you pay, but prices will come down. You just watch. They’ll come down and they’ll come down fast. Not only with insurance, with everything. At the center of our effort to bring the cost of living under control will be the all out push to end the Biden-Harris war on a thing called American Energy. American Energy. We will drill, baby, drill. We’re going to bring energy prices down. Thank you. And just so you know, they stopped it and it was terrible what they did. That’s what caused the whole problem. The country, even with supply chains, I mean, it just caused a problem. And then they said, “Oh, go back to the Trump plan now.” Now they’re drilling, but the day after the election, if they win this election, the drilling stops. They’re only doing this for purposes of getting elected. They said, “Let’s go back to what Trump was doing.” But the prices are still way high. You see $5 a gallon now for gasoline and much higher than that in some areas. And we will put ANWR back into service. ANWR in Alaska, it could be the largest oil field in the world. It could be larger than Saudi Arabia. It could be larger than what Russia has. And Ronald Reagan tried to get it. Good man. He tried to get it, couldn’t get it. Bush tried. Everybody tried to get it. I got it.
(35:53)
And the first… It was tough, and I got it in different times because they stop it on environmental. They use the environment to stop everything. You know that. And we’re all environmentalists. We want to see what’s right. We want clean air. We want clean water, but we don’t want to destroy our country. But they stopped it and we got it going. We got it going. We got it going like never before. It was all set to go. And then think of this, the first week in office, they stopped it. They gave it back. They said, “No, we’re not going to do it.” The greatest, not only great for Alaska, which is an incredible place and beautiful state, they wanted it so badly. Economic development for Alaska would’ve been so good, but worldwide. I mean, we would’ve been selling oil and gas all over the world, especially with Asia because of where it’s located.
(36:42)
So Asia, all over the world and they stopped it. But we’ll start it up again very, very soon. We’re going to get it very quickly. We’ll get it approved again very quickly. And your prices are going to come tumbling down. Your gasoline is going to come tumbling down, and your heating bills and cooling bills are going to be coming down. You have places like in New England, I don’t know how they put up with it. You have the highest costs almost anywhere. Your costs for energy, for heat, for air conditioning are through the roof. And you know why? Because they don’t want to put a pipeline through a section of New York that desperately wants it to happen. A very poor area. They won’t do it. And until fairly recently, you know who used to deliver them the oil? Russia. Russia ships were pulling up to New England. How is that?
(37:32)
Under Kamala’s extreme high-cost energy policy known as net-zero. You know what? Net-zero, they have no idea what it means by the way. It’s net-zero. What does that mean? Nobody knows. Ask her what it means. We’re going to go to a net-zero policy. What does that mean? I have no idea. She’s attempting to abolish oil, coal, and natural gas. 84% of US energy supply. She wants it ended. Do you think that’s going to lift your prices a little bit? Think of that. They’re going to take away 84% and the real stuff. That’s the stuff that powers the plants. It’s not wind that goes around and around. “And darling, let’s watch the President’s State of the Union speech tonight.” “I’m sorry. We won’t be able to do it. The wind isn’t blowing, darling. We have no electricity. We have no electricity, darling. We won’t be able to watch tonight, but perhaps sometime during the week, it will be blowing and we’ll be able to get our television going.”
(38:34)
Upon taking office, Harris Biden shut down the Keystone XL pipeline. They issued orders to close dozens and dozens of existing power plants. And Kamala has vowed that if elected, she will absolutely ban fracking. She said, “I’ll ban fracking.” Just recently. “I’ll ban fracking. There will be no fracking.” That means that she can’t win the state of Pennsylvania because Pennsylvania is all about fracking. That’s their biggest industry. And you know what? Pennsylvania, I hope you’re watching because that’s what she says. And that’s what she’ll do, and that’s what you’ll go back to. She wants to ban fracking, and she’s wanted it for her entire career. And we’re not going to let her destroy our country like that. We’re not going to let her.
(39:19)
If Harris gets in, energy, prices will skyrocket far more than even in Europe. Europe’s a basic disaster because they’ve tended to go a little bit woke. But that’s now changing. Have you been watching? That’s changing. Inflation will surge into double digits in our own country, and your quality of life will absolutely collapse. Your quality of life is going to collapse under these lunatics. By contrast, she said it already has. Who said that, ma’am? You look healthy though. You look very nice. You look very nice. By contrast, I’m announcing today that under my leadership, the United States will commit to the ambitious

Donald Trump (40:00):

[inaudible 00:40:00] goal of slashing energy and electricity prices by half, at least half. We intend to slash prices by half within 12 months, at a maximum 18 months, and if it doesn’t work out, you’ll say, “Oh, well, I voted for him. I still got them down a lot,” but we’re looking to cut them in half and we think we’ll be able to do better. And every single thing that I promised, I produced, every single thing. You will never have had energy so low as you will under a certain gentleman known as Donald J. Trump. Have you heard of him? So we think your energy bills will be down by 50 to 70%. How good would that be for a thing called inflation? How good will that be? Energy’s such a big topic, such a big cost, so powerful, so big that if you have a doughnut shop, you have the ovens, you have a truck that delivers the doughnuts. Whatever you do, your heating, your cooling, everything is about that.
(41:20)
That’s where they really blew it. They blew it with too much borrowing. They blew it with wasting 9 and $10 trillion on the scam, the great scam in history. There are a lot of scams that they worked on. Where’s the laptop from hell? Is it around by any… But they did it by doing a lot of things, but with the energy, it’s such a big topic. No matter what business you’re in, you have to heat your business, cool your business. You need cars, trucks to get there and to take the product. It’s so energy dominated. My administration will issue rapid approvals for new energy infrastructure, unlock new lands for drilling, and achieve energy independence and energy dominant. So we want energy dominance, almost immediately. We were energy independent four years ago. Think of it. Today, we’re getting energy from Venezuela in the form of tar. We’re getting it from Venezuela, tar.
(42:20)
You ever see what it is to make oil out of tar? They have tar, they have a lot of tar. It’s not good. You know where they make it? In Houston, Texas. It’s the only plant in the world that can take this material and turn it into gasoline and oil. But no, it’s tar and they’re doing very well. Speaking of that, just for a second, so Venezuela crime is down 72% because they’re taking all of their criminals out of Caracas, out of the different places. Their mental institutions are literally closing up. They’re taking the people from mental institutions, people from prisons and jails, terrorists. They have terrorists all over the place, and you know where they’re bringing them? Welcome to the United States of America. Murderers, drug dealers, and Venezuelan crime is down 72%, but that’s only one.
(43:13)
All over the world, crime is down because they’re taking their criminals and their people from mental institutions and they’re putting them into our country because we have stupid people like Kamala and Joe running our country, and there’s never been anything like this. And if you look at New York today and you look at a couple of… Remember I said, “Migrant crime will be a big subject.” I said that a year ago. Everyone said, “Oh, no. Oh, he’s so wrong.” Do you see what’s happening with migrant crime? They make our criminals look like nice people. They do. These are the toughest people in the world, the toughest people. We built 571 miles of wall as an example. They could have… It’s more than I said I was going to build, but then I was going to add 200 miles. We had it built and they didn’t put it up, would’ve taken three weeks to erect. It was all there, ready to put up, would’ve taken three weeks to put up, and that’s when I said, they actually want open borders and Kamala wants open borders, and she said it for 15 years.
(44:18)
She wants open borders. She only changed recently when she noticed in a poll that wasn’t polling too well. People don’t want open borders where people can flow into our country. To further combat inflation, I will terminate Kamala Harris’s Green New scam and rescind all of the unspent funds, give all of the unspent funds back to building roads, bridges, and give it back to the government. And it’s like throwing, what she did, what they did was like throwing billions of dollars out the window. We will stop wasteful spending and big government special interest giveaways, and finally stand up for the American taxpayer, which hasn’t happened since I was president. We stood up. We stood up. We stood up. Prior to COVID coming in, in history, there’s never been an economy like we had. Then when COVID came in, we rebuilt the military, we defeated ISIS. Everybody said it would take 10 years to defeat. I did it in eight months.
(45:19)
We rebuilt that whole… We did so many things and we created the greatest economy. I get a lot of credit on everything, including the economy. When COVID came in, we had to do certain things, we had to make certain moves. And if we didn’t make those moves, Scott, and if we didn’t help businesses survive for that little period of time, you would’ve had that 1929 style depression. That’s what you would’ve had. We did a great job, but then when we handed it to them, the stock market was higher than it was previous to COVID coming in. Think of that. It was actually higher, and we handed them something that was a jewel. By the way, more people died from COVID in the Biden administration than the Trump administration, and he got it when it was ending all over the world. It was pretty much ending.
(46:06)
So we never really got the credit we deserved for that, with the ventilators and all of the different things that we did, the outfits, a lot of things we were producing in New Hampshire, in different places, masks. We had mask factories opening up. We had everything and we did a good job. And then it came back and it should have come roaring back, but they really blew it. They spent so much money. They didn’t have to spend any more money. What they had to do is let our economy take over, but we had some great Republican governors that did a fantastic job. The Democrat governors not so much. Out of the top 25, as an example, crime-ridden cities, virtually every single one of them is run by Democrats. Think of that.
(46:53)
To make both new and used cars more affordable, I will end the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate on day one. Doesn’t make sense. And by the way, there’s a great place for electric cars. They’re going to do great. I think they’re going to do great, and Elon’s heard me say that many times. He still endorsed me. I wouldn’t be able to change. It’s a question of how far do they go, and how much do they cost, and all of the different things, factors. But electric cars have a great place in our country, but you have to be able to really get gasoline powered cars, hybrids, many different types. Diesel, you want diesel with trucks. They want to make trucks all electric. Going to California, you have six stops. With diesel, you have no stops. That’s hard to beat, right? If they’re too heavy… Common sense, we’re the party of common sense. An electric truck weighs twice what a, more than twice, two and a half times what a gasoline propelled truck weighs, right?
(47:59)
That would mean you would have to rebuild every bridge and tunnel in the United States. Oh, that sounds reasonable. It would cost so much money. The United States doesn’t have, every country together doesn’t have what it would cost, but there’s a great place for electric, but there’s a place for everything, and you should be able to go out and buy what you want. You go out and buy what you want. To further reduce consumer prices, I will immediately eliminate every single costly job-killing regulation the Biden-Harris administration has created, and they’ve created a lot. Remember I took out 12 for every one I created, and we ended up doing more than that. We got rid of so many regulations that were so unnecessary. Some of them were a hundred years old. In my first term, our regulation cuts saved the typical American family, $11,000.
(48:48)
In my next term, the Trump dividend will be even larger. It’ll be a dividend. By repealing the Biden-Harris regulatory onslaught, we can save an estimated $20,000 and you’re talking about a tremendous amount, six, seven, $8,000 a year, just in savings. So to get to economic relief, to workers and families, we will make additional tax cuts. That’s what gave us the great economy. We’ll make tax cuts, additionally, we’ll make them permanent because we have a thing where they want to terminate at the end of the period, when they expire, the Trump tax cuts. Five years, they want to let them expire. That would mean your taxes would go up four times. You’ll be paying four times as much, and we will do something else which was copied, viciously, ruthlessly copied. No tax on tips, okay? No tax on tips. If they wanted to do that, why didn’t they do it three and a half years ago? They didn’t want it.
(49:56)
It was actually the opposite. They hired 88,000 IRS agents to go after these people. So for every position the fake new Kamala takes down and all of these positions, three weeks ago, the real Kamala said the exact opposite. The exact opposite. With me, you will always have a president who tells it like it is. You will always have somebody where I let you know where I stand, and you can vote for me or not, but you need that, and you need consistency, and you need brilliance. You need brilliance. She is not a brilliant person. She is not a smart person. She is not very smart. But it is crazy, isn’t it though? Isn’t it crazy? She was so disrespected just a few weeks ago, and now it’s like Kamala, Kamala, the fake news. The fake news is a threat to our country. Don’t kid yourself. To help seniors on fixed incomes who are suffering the ravages of inflation, there will be no tax on Social Security. We’re going to stop it. No tax on Social Security. This cruel double taxation of Social Security benefits, and this has been talked about for a long time. She’ll probably announce this on Friday too. Oh, look, they have a spy in the audience right over there. He’s spying. Let’s see, Kamala, I think we should do no tax on Social Security. But it only came into existence in 1984, and at that time it only affected a very small number of recipients, but now nearly half of all seniors are forced to pay income tax on Social Security. And thanks to inflation under Harris, she is horrible, this tax hits more seniors every year, more and more, and they can’t make it. They’re not making it. They’re failing. The people that did it, right, they saved, they worked, they saved and saved, Those are the people that were hurt most by this kind of thinking and this economy.
(52:11)
With your vote, I will end this injustice and I will always protect Social Security and Medicare for our great seniors, just as I did for four incredible years. There was never any talk about doing anything. By contrast, Kamala Harris has a three-step plan to destroy Medicare and to destroy Social Security. First, she has thrown open our borders. You know what that’s going to do? They’re all signing up. Oh, congratulations. They’ll be all signing up right next to you, but she’s opened up our borders. Think of it, again, I believe it’s 20 million people, but I think it’s probably much… Well, with the gotaways. You know what a gotaway is, right? Remember, I had Remain in Mexico policy. You think that was easy to get from Mexico? What I had to do to them. And I had Remain in Mexico, they ended it immediately. They thought it was unfair to Mexico. Can you believe that? Mexico’s like, it’s like a railroad track coming into our country.
(53:06)
They thought it was unfair. It’s not unfair, but Mexico agreed to it, Remain in Mexico, and they ended it very early. They ended it almost immediately. Second, she’s flooding our country with millions and millions of low-wage migrants and giving them welfare, free healthcare, food stamps, public benefits. And third, she’s giving them what our military vets don’t get. They’re sleeping on a street in freezing or very hot weather, and illegal immigrants that came in so illegally and don’t speak a word of English, are living in some of the most luxurious hotels in the world. It’s incredible. You see that? You’ve been seeing the stories. They’re living in hotels. They’re taking, right, Front Row Joes, they’re taking some of the best hotels because the government pays more than they can get from wealthy customers. So they say, “Well, I don’t know about this. I think we’ll take the illegal immigrant. We’re going to get more money from the US government than some rich guy coming in from Argentina.” And third, she wants to make them all citizens, dumping them into Medicare and Social Security until those programs buckle and collapse, and that’s what’s going to happen.
(54:23)
Under them, Social Security, Medicare and other programs will collapse. No country can sustain what’s happening right now. The millions of illegal aliens pouring into our country, under a border czar Harris, are coming from all sorts of places, from countries unknown, literally from countries unknown. And they, as I said, they’re coming in from prisons and from mental institutions, and they’re coming in as terrorists. We have more terrorists living in our country right now, and nothing good is going to happen from this, and now it’s getting more and more violent. Just pick up the newspapers. Turn on your television. People stabbed a woman yesterday, raped in New York, raped viciously, and when they said she was raped, you know what she said? “They weren’t trying to rape me. They were trying to kill me.”
(55:14)
They were trying to kill her, and he was a gentleman from a certain country I won’t mention, happened to be in South America, but it’s not South America, it’s all over the world that they’re coming in. It’s not South America. They’re coming from all over the world. Just this week in Coney Island, Kamala had two, think of this one, migrants, they came in, we call them the Kamala migrants, and they were arrested for rape of a 46-year-old woman, and it was a rough situation. There were four or five other situations over the last couple of days. Rape and murder, rape and beating, rape and something else, and sometimes just immediate killing. These people are brutal. These are people that came out of the toughest jails anywhere in the world, from all over the world, and we can’t take them. No country can sustain it. No country.
(56:15)
They all said I was wrong when I said that migrant crime will reach epidemic proportions, and now it’s much worse than that. It’s a lot worse than epidemic proportions. It’s beyond control. We have a new category of crime. It’s called migrant crime, and I think it’s going to end up being the worst category of all. These people are tough. They’re tough, they’re mean. They’re angry, and they shouldn’t be in our country, and it’s not going to work out well. The migrants that Harris let in are raping our women and hurting our children, and now Kamala wants to let them pillage Social Security and Medicare. That’s what’s going to happen. It will never happen. It will never even get close to happening if I’m in office, and I think you’re going to have to put me in office because there’s never been anything like this.
(57:15)
If Kamala wins, you will have mass amnesty and citizenship for all of the Biden-Harris illegals that poured into our country. If I win, you will have the largest deportation operation in American history, starting at noon on Inauguration Day 2025. And I don’t say that happily because it’s not an easy situation. We have so many people, it’s not sustainable. But Dwight D. Eisenhower, Dwight Eisenhower, General Eisenhower, President Eisenhower, he was very strong on borders. He felt that you cannot do this. The largest deportation operation we ever had was under Dwight Eisenhower, president, and he understood that it was not sustainable to have millions of people coming in, but what he went through is peanuts compared to what we’re going through. No country, no border has ever gone through what we’re going through and they’re destroying our country.
(58:18)
The Kamala migrant invasion is also a major factor in crushing your wages, and driving up the cost of healthcare, and the cost of all of your goods. Millions of uninsured illegal aliens are getting billions and billions of dollars in free healthcare, paid for by American citizens on your medical bills. It’s right on your medical bills. When you hear this, you get angry because it shouldn’t happen, but what happens to them? They come up in caravans. I think I came up with that name, but they have caravans of thousands and thousands of people, many, many criminals in those caravans. Very dangerous, unbelievably dangerous for women. The women in those caravans are just absolutely… It’s horrible what happens. I’m not going to tell you now. It’s horrible. It’s horrible what happens in those caravans coming up.
(59:09)
It’s a rough journey, but they come up because we have very stupid people here that say, “If you come up, we will give you healthcare, Social Security, medical, school.” Our schools, in a lot of places, are not… You can’t even go anymore. They’ve taken the place of our students. They have people sitting in chairs that don’t speak a word of English, and they’re taking the place of our young children. The hospitals, a person told me the other day from San Diego, they said they can’t get into a hospital anymore. The hospitals are being occupied by the illegal aliens. Somebody’s got to take care, they’re being occupied. And the reason they’re coming is because people like Gavin New-scum and people like Kamala are saying, “Come, come. It’s the American dream. Come.” They’re destroying our country. We

Donald Trump (01:00:00):

We can’t do it. We can’t let it continue. You’re not going to have a country anymore. People like Scott, brilliant Wall Street people, they’re right about what they say, and that’s also common sense. I’ll tell you, it’s all about common sense. The Republican Party is the party of common sense.
(01:00:23)
Kamala Harris wants to eliminate private health insurance. Does anybody have private health insurance here? A lot of people, yeah. A lot of people. They want it. That’s what they want. They want to have that. Now, if you want to have other, you have other. But they want to take it and they want to turn it off. It doesn’t cost our country anything. They want to turn it… This is what people, they work hard, they make enough money, they want to have a private plan. It’s a more luxurious plan, that’s okay, but they want to give free taxpayer-funded healthcare to every single illegal alien in this country. Kamala wants to do that.
(01:00:55)
Now, she’ll probably… Here’s a little bet we’ll make, you’ll probably change over the next short period of time. We said, what do you do with some monsters that we have? Monsters, some of the worst killers in the world, in detention centers. You know they’re in detention centers that we have along the border. And you know what she said? They have to be released. Released. We’re going to release. These are murders, these are killers, these are drug dealers. These are the worst people on earth. You don’t get much worse. She said… Now she’ll probably change her mind on that too, but she wants to release. This is, remember, I said it before, a person that’s considered far more liberal than crazy Bernie Sanders. He’s crazy. And far more liberal than crazy Bernie. This is considered worse and we’re not going to have a president like that.
(01:01:48)
Somebody was saying last night on television that when the people find out, the wonderful Sean Hannity actually said it. Have you ever heard of him? Yes. But he said it, but everyone’s saying it. When people find out about her, that she’s a very liberal person, they use the word progressive, they don’t use liberal anymore, they use progressive, because it sounds so nice. Progressive. What is progressive? That means forward-thinking. It’s not, it’s the opposite. But she’s the most liberal senator that we’ve had in 50, 60 years, I think probably ever. But far more liberal than crazy Bernie. By contrast, I’m going to keep the Affordable Care Act unless we can do something much better, we’ll keep it. It stinks, it’s not good. If we can do something better, we’re going to do something with it. If we can do better, meaning less expensive and better healthcare for you, less expensive and better healthcare for you, then we’ll do it. We’re not looking better for the government. We’re looking better for you.
(01:02:52)
She goes around saying, “He’s going to get rid of the health…” No, I’m going to keep it. Unless we can come up with something that’s better for you and less expensive for you. Otherwise, we’re not doing it. And you saw that having to do with Social Security, for four years I was there, and for four years I never raised the age. They’re going to end up raising your age by five years. I never raised your age. I never did anything. I left your plan the way it was. Never touched it. I was there four years. Same thing with Russia. They said, “Oh, he’s going to go and start a war or something.” Well, you know what? For four years, Russia never went in to Ukraine. They waited until I got out and then the Army started to form. But if you go back with Russia, Bush let them have a lot of land, you know that.
(01:03:40)
Obama. President Barack Hussein Obama, have you heard of him? Barack Hussein Obama let them have a lot of land. Now you have Biden, he’s letting them have the whole thing, okay, the whole thing. But you had President Trump. What did Putin take under Trump? Nothing. Nothing, took nothing. He took nothing under Trump, but he took under Bush, he took under Obama, big, big stuff. He took it in Ukraine, in and around Ukraine. But he took nothing under Trump. But now he’s going for the big one, isn’t he?
(01:04:18)
We’re going to deliver lower prices, lower drug costs, new options that will dramatically reduce the crushing burden of American patients. Kamala and Joe try to take credit for $35 insulin. You know that, you know who did that? I did that. I did that. I did the insulin and it kicked in. I remember when I did it, it had to be a statute. It was a certain statute that took a certain period of time. I said, “I hope I’m elected because somebody’s going to get a lot of credit for doing what I got done.” I got it done. $35 insulin, and now they take credit for it. It’s terrible, terrible. They take credit for a lot of things they shouldn’t be taking credit for. If they said, “Congratulations, you did a good job with insulin.” That’ll be nice. Nobody’s going to go crazy about that. “Congratulations.” Because insulin was impossible for people to afford. They were dying. They didn’t get… The expense was… I got it for $35.
(01:05:11)
Nobody thinks it’s even possible, but they could say like, “You did a great job, thank you very much.” Or, “You did a good job.” But instead they say, “We brought insulin in at $35.” It’s a lie. Kamala is fighting for healthcare for illegal aliens and fighting for healthcare for… And think of this, he’s fighting for healthcare for people that are destroying our country. I’m fighting for healthcare for the American people, the people that are supposed to have the healthcare. The colossal influx of migrants into our cities is driving rent, rent, absolutely through the roof. That’s why… And you know who’s paying the rent? The government. Our government is paying rent. We’re paying numbers that were not obtainable.
(01:06:01)
In fact, if I ever went back into business, I’d buy some buildings in certain areas and I’ll charge the government the highest rents you’ve ever seen. That’s what they’re doing. Some very smart landlords are getting a lot of money. That’s why some of the luxury hotels are going into migrants. They can make much more money renting to a migrant than to wealthy people. But that’s why as president, I will seal the border, I will send them all back to their countries where they belong. Prices will come down and come down dramatically and come down fast. To further address the housing affordability crisis, we will work with states like Nevada, a great state. We’re leading big in the poll there, by the way. Thank you very much. Good governor. To open up large tracts of federal land for housing constructions and similar to Opportunity Zones that I did with Senator Tim Scott, a great guy, from South Carolina. Senator from South Carolina. Came in, he said, “I have this idea.” He’s had it for a long time, but he could never get a president to execute it. I did. And Opportunity Zones, one of the greatest things that we’ve done in terms of economic development, I give Tim Scott a lot of credit for that too. These areas will have low taxes, low regulation, to stimulate rapid economic growth, maximum affordability, and the return of a thing called, which I always come back to, the American dream, because we’ve lost the American dream.
(01:07:33)
We will bring back our supply chains. Supply chains were basically not even talked… It was automatic. You have a thing, it’s delivered from here to here. When this lunatic became president with her, remember she was there at every step of the way, but she was like silent because she was… I don’t know, nobody respected her until she was the only choice left. They couldn’t get anybody else. Did you see where they had the 12 most likely people to be chosen after Biden? And she was ranked number last, and she was the one that was picking. She was ranked. She was ranked below Tim. He was second, I think. Second to last.
(01:08:12)
We will bring back our supply chain. We are going to bring back our supply chains. We’re going to bring them back from China and other foreign countries ending costly supply chains. Those are supply chain disruptions. We’re going to bring them back. We’re going to bring them back fast as we reduce burdens on domestic manufacturers. American workers will make our critical goods better and cheaper. We’re going to make them in our country right here in the USA, right here in a place called North Carolina. Have you heard of it? Have you heard?
(01:08:47)
We are going to have 10 to 20% tariffs on foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years. We’re going to charge them 10 to 20% to come in and take advantage of our country because that’s what they’ve been doing for nothing, to take our jobs. We’re going to charge them and bring back millions and millions of jobs by doing so, and billions and billions of dollars. I did that with China. I took in hundreds of billions of dollars with China. Nobody ever took in 10 cents from China and it slowed them down and it made us much better. In fact, Biden’s been unable to take those tariffs off China because it’s so much money coming in, they don’t know what to do. How do you replace it? Our current… He’s on the take, yeah, you’re right. Do you come from North Carolina, sir? Where is the guy that said that? He’s on the take. It’s pretty good. I would say he could be right, he is right. Our current massive deficits will be reduced to practically nothing. Our country will be powered by growth.
(01:09:52)
Our country will be powered by growth. We’ll pay off our debt. We’ll have all this income coming in. If people want to take advantage of our country, they have to pay to take advantage of our country. I will also restore peace through strength and with the return of global stability will come the return of economic stability. We’re going to have economic stability. We have wars breaking out all over the world. And they asked the head of the prime minister of Hungary, very tough man, strong man, somebody that I always got along… I get along with the strong ones. I don’t get along with the weak ones. Isn’t that sad? That’s a personality defect. The tough ones, but the tough ones are the ones we have to worry about, that’s a good thing.
(01:10:39)
But Viktor Orbán. Viktor Orbán of Hungary. So they asked him, “What do we do? Wars are breaking out all over the world.” He said, the answer is very simple. Make sure that Trump gets reelected president and you’re not going to have any more wars. You’re not going to have any more problems. They respected him. They respected Trump. They respected Trump. He actually used a different word. I would not use that word, but he can. He said they were afraid of Trump because they had no idea where the hell I was coming from. With Joe, it’s sort of easy to tell, isn’t it? The whole thing is crazy. You know what we’re going through? It’s crazy. They arrest their political opponent. They go after their political… The whole place is, our country, is like a different place. No more wars, no more disruptions. We will have prosperity and we will have peace. And this is how we will end the era of inflation, mayhem and misery under Kamala and Crooked Joe, and unleash economic abundance for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed.
(01:11:57)
Together we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates, low inflation, so that everyone can afford groceries, a car and a home. Common sense. We will stop the invasion, end the migrant crime, support our great police, save Medicare and save social security, which is under siege. We will strengthen our military, build a missile defense shield, keep critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools, and keep men out of women’s sports. We will defend the Second Amendment, restore free speech, and we will secure our elections. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with opportunity, hope and joy. But for that to happen, we must never let Kamala Harris get anywhere near the White House. And we must defeat her country-destroying liberal agenda. She destroyed San Francisco. She’s not going to destroy our country.
(01:13:26)
So get your friends, get your family, register, volunteer, and get the hell out and vote. You got to vote. On November 5th, we will save our economy, we will rescue our middle class, we will put America first and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, North Carolina. God bless you. God bless you all. Thank you very much.","Asheville, North Carolina","2024-08-15",0,10,3,2,3,0,0,14,0,0

Thank you. Wow. Thank you very much. Thank you. Is that a big crowd? A nice crowd.
(00:21)
Thank you very much and a very, very special, hello, Montana. I’ve been traveling all over your state. I’ll tell you, I know Montana better than you know… I was all over your state today. Everything’s two hours. “When are we going to be there?” “Two hours, sir. Two hours.” I got to like Tim Sheehy a lot to be here. You better win. You better win. No, this is some beautiful country though. I did do a lot of driving. We went to a really good friend’s house with your governor. You have a great governor in this state. You know that, right? But we went around the state and it was so beautiful and I’d say, “When will I be there?” “Approximately two and a half hours, sir.” “Oh great, thank you.” It’s a big state, it’s a beautiful state, and we love it and we’ve won it every time by a lot.
(01:21)
So I’m thrilled to be back in this incredible place, this beautiful state, with thousands of proud, hard-working American patriots, which is what you are. You built the country. Less than three months from now. We are going to defeat radical left Democrat, John Tester. He’s terrible. He is terrible. He’s terrible. And send Tim Sheehy to the United States Senate. We’re going to evict crazy Kamala. Do you know, ever hear of Kamala? Radical left. Radical left. Well, she has a couple of things that a lot of people from Montana would like. She wants to take away your guns. You like that, right? All right, how about this? She wants to defund the police. Are you okay with that? She wants to allow millions of people to pour into our border through an invasion using an invasion process. I don’t think so. I don’t think that’s for you. It’s not for me either. It’s not for most people in this country. We’re going to evict crazy Kamala and we’re going to, we’re get Joe Biden out of the White House.
(02:43)
What’s he doing now? Greg, what’s he doing? He wanted to debate. If we didn’t have a debate, he’d still be there. Can you imagine if we didn’t have a debate? Why the hell did I debate him? How did he do? Do you think he’s happy with the… I don’t think so. He’s not too happy. They took it away from him. They really did. They took it away. The guy had 14 million votes, she had none. But I’d rather run against her. I think she’s easier to beat. I really do. I believe it.
(03:19)
And we are going to make America great again. We’re going to make it so great. This election is about saving our economy, ending inflation, securing our borders, restoring respect for our nation, we’re no longer respected, preventing World War III, especially for all these young people, these young beautiful people. We don’t want to get them into World War III, and stopping a 1929-style depression, because that’s what’s going to happen. You saw what happened last week. With your vote we will reverse the Kamala crash and we will end the Kamala chaos and we will stop the Biden-Harris invasion of people that don’t belong in our country. They’re invading our country.
(04:14)
Kamala Harris. It’s interesting, nobody really knows her last name. If you ask people, “Do you know what her last name is?” Nobody has any idea what it is. Harris. It’s like Harris. I don’t know. How the hell did this happen? So we had the debate. He didn’t exactly do well and they actually… CNN was very nice. They said, “That was one of the greatest debate performances I’ve ever seen.” Said by a very important person at CNN. Then what happens? Two days later they said he was lousy. They don’t talk about me anymore. They just said he was lousy. And he was pretty bad, you have to admit. But we’re going to turn it around. We’re going to turn this country around. We’re going to turn it around very fast. We’re going to turn it around very fast. And Kamala is not up to the job. She’s not up to it. Neither is Tester up to it. Tester, everyone thinks like he’s my best friend. He’s never voted for me once, and yet his commercials is, “I like Donald Trump very much. I love his pride. I love his border stance.” He votes against the border. He voted against funding of the border. He said, “I love his stance on energy.” He voted against our energy programs. He votes against us 100%. He’s voted in favor of crooked Joe Biden 100% of the time. He did it last time with the election. We had the same problem. Do you remember? He comes out, everyone’s saying, “He really likes your policy a lot.” He doesn’t like. He’s a radical left lunatic, just like Kamala and we got to elect him. We got to get him in. We got to get Tim in.
(06:03)
Since becoming a presidential candidate, she has refused to do a single interview. You know why? Because she’s dumb. Or hold a single press conference. She won’t hold the press conference. She won’t do it. She won’t do it. And they’re easy questions because the press, look at them back there, look at all of them, a lot of press. But they’re rigged. They’re rigged. They’re fake news. I get these tough questions from the press all the time, and I look at the questions that Joe got. “Where do you think you’re having dinner tonight? What will you eat? Will you have ice cream for dessert?” “No. I don’t know. It’s unfair, the questions, are so hard,” he says. No, the way they treated him and with me, I won’t use the questions, ’cause I don’t want to give them any ideas. They give me the worst questions. They are so nasty. They’re the nastiest people, I think, on Earth.
(07:14)
And Kamala, Kamala gives the exact same speech over and over again. Over and over, the same exact words. One of the people put it up, they put six of them up and it was like every single word is the same. I don’t do that. I got to give you a little bit of variety, right? I change all these damn speeches. Where are my speech writers? I’m going to do that. Just have one speech and just for the next 90 days, go out and just read that thing. But we don’t like to read teleprompters, right? It’s not as much fun. It’s not as exciting, and somehow it’s never as good, is it? No. I think we’re going to write up one standard speech. You read it from beginning to end. You know what would happen? You’d start walking out. They’d say, “Oh look, Trump’s not holding…” How about yesterday? They said, “Oh, she had a big crowd.” Oh, the crowd. The press is talking about the crowd.
(08:13)
In New Jersey, I had 107,000 people. The press never even talked about it. They don’t talk about it, right? They don’t talk about because they’re fake. I went to South Carolina, we had 82,000 people. Oh, front row Joe. Look, we have many front row Joes. We have Mr. Wall over here. Look. I love that suit. Do you think he’s in favor of building a wall? I think so. Yes. I think so. He’s great. How many have you come to? Over 200, right? And he is a great guy. He makes a lot of money. You got to make a lot of money. He travels all over the country. But the front row Joes are great. We have so many people. They’ve been to so many of the rallies. The rallies are great.
(09:06)
We had a tough one four weeks ago. Very tough one, right? We had a very tough one. Lost a great person, Corey. Great firefighter, great person, really amazing man. Corey, you’re a tough one. And two gentlemen, real Trumpers, real Trump people, the people they love our country. What’s a Trumper? They love our country too. Really, really badly hurt. They didn’t think they were going to make it and they did make it and they’re going to be as good as ever and that’s great. The doctors in that whole Butler area did a phenomenal job, I will tell you. They thought these two would not make it. And they not only made it, they’ll be as good as new, but it’ll take a little work. But they got hit hard.
(09:53)
All Kamala does is read that teleprompter while pretending she had nothing to do with any of the disasters that they… You know, she’s totally given up of all of the things she said. “I want this, I want that, I want that.” Now she doesn’t want any of it. And then they accused me of being horrible when I questioned her. She wanted to be non-energy independent. She wants windmills all over the place. Windmills. Put a windmill on top of the building. We have so much oil under our feet. We have more liquid gold under our feet than any country in the world, including Saudi Arabia and Russia. And we don’t use it.
(10:34)
Four weeks ago, think of it, four weeks ago, the media said she was grossly incompetent. And I said, “Oh, this is going to be an easy race.” She didn’t have a chance of beating me. She couldn’t do anything. They wanted to get her out. They thought she should resign with crooked Joe Biden. What do you like better? It doesn’t matter anymore, but what do you like better, crooked Joe or sleepy Joe? Sleepy Joe, crooked Joe. Okay, ready? They’re both correct. I think crooked Joe is more correct. All right, ready? Crooked first, right? What do you like better? Crooked Joe or sleepy Joe? Crooked seems to always win. I mean, he’s a crooked guy. All he had to do is, think of it, if he didn’t do the debate, he’d still be running. They’d be saying how great he is, he’s a brilliant man, wonderful guy, really at the top of his game. He wasn’t at the top of his game 25 years ago, I’ll tell you right now.
(11:46)
And she’s worse than he is. She’s worse. He’s smarter than she is. But the Democrats didn’t have the courage to force her off. They didn’t have it. They didn’t want to do it. It was politically incorrect. And now the media is saying that she’s wonderful. She’s wonderful. The same people back there. Four of them I recognize so perfectly. If you can’t do a press conference, you cannot be president. Okay? That’s it. She doesn’t do anything. Remember when I used to always walk up to the press under the helicopter or under the wing of the plane and talk to them? I loved it because if I didn’t like their question, I could say, “I can’t hear you. The helicopters…” But they do mini versions of it. Nobody ever did that before, you know. And they copy. Everybody copies me. So now she walks up, she’ll take like a half a question and she’ll leave. Joe was bad. Joe couldn’t hear. He couldn’t do anything. It was an embarrassment to that art form. That was an art form. It was an embarrassment.
(12:50)
Kamala sometimes referred to as Kamala. She’s got about nine different ways of pronouncing the name. And because the press is so dishonest, no matter how you say it, they’ll say, “You were wrong. You were wrong.” I don’t care if I get it right. Actually, I couldn’t care a less. Couldn’t care. I actually haven’t been accused that I know of, of calling it wrong. But if I did, they’d say that he did it on purpose. And you could do that. I’ve done a lot of bad name-calling where you call somebody that you know how to say the name perfectly and you call it on purpose. They say, “Sir, you made a mistake.” I said, “No, I didn’t.” Kamala will not answer for her record of failure and weakness. A doctor, please? Doctor, in the house? Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Take your time. Take your time, doc. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. We love these people. They wait for two days sometimes and then it’s tough. It’s not easy. Are they okay? Thank you very much. And, Doctor, take your time. Good. Thank you, darling. Thank you. Thank you. Take your time, doctor, please. We got a lot of time, right? Nice Friday evening. Friday evening in Montana. I think my next drive is going to be about three, four hours from me. I wish it was a little closer. That’s the one thing. But that’s okay. That’s all right. Our governor says, we have all the time we want. Greg says, we have all… You got one of the best governors. Do they appreciate it or not? I don’t know. And the governor’s wife? I don’t know. He’s a great one. He’s a great guy.

Crowd (15:25):

Four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years.

Donald Trump (15:58):

We better. We better get four more years. And we’re not going to have a country left If we don’t get four more years. We’re going to not have a country left. That’s why so many people, they come and they waited for days. They wait for days, and it’s tough. It’s tough. Thank you, darling. Thank you. Yay. Wow. Thank you, honey. That’s great. That’s really good. Incredible people. So when you’re commander in chief, you don’t go to run and hide away from the press. They go and run and they want to go on a record that’s a fake record. They have a fake record, both of them. How about the new guy? How do you like him?
(16:53)
And anytime you tell a story about anybody… By the way, Steve Daines, how good is he? True. He’s one of the finest. He’s one of the finest people you’ll ever meet. I really mean that too. And it’s an honor to be with you, and you want to do this so badly because you want to save the country. We need the Senate. We need the Senate. So thank you, Steve, for being here. Thank you. And with a beautiful family. But you don’t get to flee from tough questions, and you don’t get to read a teleprompter for short periods of time, where you make a speech that’s like two minutes and everything is right off the teleprompter. What a lot of work to do for that. And you don’t sit across the table from Vladimir Putin and President Xi of China. They’re lovely individuals. If you can’t handle our press, ’cause they’re not as tough as you think, I’ve been handling them for four years and then another four years. They don’t stop. They keep coming at you. They’re the worst.
(17:58)
But we are going to do something. We’re going to have the biggest victory. They’re going to celebrate because I think silently, they do celebrate. I think silently they do. I think silently they’re for us. They’re afraid to say it, right? They’re afraid to say it. But I think silently a lot of those people back there in the press, and that’s a lot of people, but I think they’re for us. For nearly four years, Joe Biden’s mental incompetence has given Harris a free rein to impose her ultra-liberal agenda on America, and others with her, and destroy our country. You’re destroying our country. Joe Biden was exposed during the debate. Likewise, Kamala will be exposed during the debate. She will be exposed during the debate or debates. But so far she’s refusing to debate. We want to have a debate.
(18:52)
Think of it. So she wants to have no debates, but one may be at the most, and she wants it to be an ABC with George Stopodopoulos, have you ever heard of it? It’s the nastiest of all. Who would think it, right? You think of NBC as terrible, and they are. MSNBC is disgusting, but the worst might be ABC. And that’s the only one she’ll do. And when Biden came out with a brilliant idea to have a debate, how did that work out for him? Not so good. But he came out. They handed me Jake Tapper, sometimes referred to as Fake Tapper, but I have to tell you, he was totally fair and Dana Bash, and they were totally fair. They really were. CNN. So they said, “We want a debate.” They gave me one option because they weren’t going to debate if he didn’t want to debate. They gave me one option. “CNN, Dana Bash and Jake Tapper. There will be no audience. They will be turning off your mics as soon as you finish speaking and if you go over one second, they turn off and they make you look very bad.”
(19:59)
The good part is he didn’t use much of his. They give you two minutes and they’d say, “Right, you have 92 seconds left.” And I kept saying, “I’ll take it. Can I have it? I want it. I want the 92 seconds at this.” And then they’d do another one, “You have 37 seconds left.” That’s a lot when you’re up there, 37 seconds. And that’s the last thing he wanted to hear because he didn’t want to talk anymore. “You have 77 seconds left.” He goes, “Oh, Joe, what am I going to do?” This is who our president was. And now we have somebody that’s worse, in my opinion, worse.
(20:36)
You have to remember, they said that he couldn’t beat me now. I mean, after the debate, he was down way down in the polls. They didn’t even want to show the polls. They said, “He’s not going to win.” So they said, “We’re going to take him out and we’re going to put somebody new.” And this never happened to anybody before. We spent a hundred million dollars fighting crooked Joe Biden, and then all of a sudden they decide to take him out and put somebody else in. She never got one vote. She was the first loser in the primaries. She ran against Joe Biden and everybody else. I think they had like 16 people running. She never made Iowa, the first state. I love Iowa. You know why I love it? ‘Cause I win it every single time with the farmers. We win it. But she never made Iowa. She was the first one to quit. And stupid, honestly, she was the nastiest to him too in any picture. I couldn’t believe it.
(21:31)
And she was part of the cabal that got him out. They got him out. They said, “We’ll do it the nice way or we’ll do it the hard way, Joe. We’ll use the 25th amendment and we’ll call you mentally incompetent and everybody will believe us.” And you know what they did is a terrible thing actually. They forced him out. It was a coup. We had a coup. That was the first coup of the history of our country, and it was very successful. He said, “Okay, I’ll leave. If that’s what you want, I’ll leave.” And now he’s seeing what the competition is. I hear he is going to make a comeback at the Democrat Convention. He’s going to walk into the room and he’s going to say, “I want my presidency back. I want another chance to debate Trump. I want another chance.” But I handed Kamala and crooked Joe a surging economy with no inflation. We had no inflation. We had nothing. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. True. Their radical socialist lunacy turned it into a failing economy with the worst inflation in probably 70 years. They say 47. I don’t believe. 47. I think it’s much more. I handed her the strongest border in US history. She turned it into the worst border invasion in the history of the world. By the way, the border chart, I love that chart. I love that chart. I’m here because of that chart. I go, “Let me see that chart.” If I don’t turn, I won’t be with you tonight. I won’t be with you. I love that chart. You know the amazing thing? I’m going to sleep with that chart tonight. No. The amazing thing is that that chart, I use it probably 20% of the time, not that much. It’s always on my left, not on my right. I mean, pretty much always.
(23:39)
We had a tremendous crowd, but all of the people, as far as the eye could see, they were here and some in the back. And how great were the people in the back? But all the people were the same. Nobody fled. When a crowd hears a bullet, they always run. They heard lots of bullets ’cause there were lots of bullets going off. And our Secret Service shooter, our Secret Service sniper, whatever you want to call him, what a shot, he used one bullet from much further away. ‘Cause the sniper was there and he was way over here. And he wasn’t warned that this could happen. I mean, that was the breakdown they had. They weren’t warned, but he heard bullets. He immediately looked over, took aim and shot one bullet. Can you imagine that? From probably 400 yards. Pretty far.
(24:33)
But if it wasn’t for that sign, in this case, he came down down to the right. It’s never on the right. Never. And it’s never at the beginning of the speech. And I don’t use the teleprompter a lot ’cause I think it gets bad. But I just said, “Let’s take a look at the immigration numbers that we had,” because they are great numbers, they’re the best numbers in the history of our country. The Border Patrol did that chart. Thank you very much, Border Patrol, I appreciate. But the Border Patrol

Donald Trump (25:00):

You all did that chant. And you see the arrow on the bottom, the red arrow on the bottom. That’s the lowest point. That was the week I left office. Look what happened after I left office. Look at that. And it’s much worse now, because that’s a few months now. The numbers are much worse. They’ve let an invasion of our country happen. But I took a look, and because I took that look, what are the chances of that? So I just want to thank everybody because tell you what, the level of love and compassion and all of the things that we all went through, that was a terrible thing. And we’re going to be very careful. We have to be very careful. By the way, being president is a dangerous profession. This is a very dangerous… This is not the safest profession out there. But there was an amazing event. And for those of you that don’t believe in God, I believe that there’s only one reason that could have happened, because the chances were so, so small. Right?
(26:14)
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much. And we’re going back to Butler. You know that, right? We’re going back to Butler, and we got to go back. We got to go back to Butler. They were great, and the hospital was incredible. The doctors were incredible, that worked on our two friends that were so badly hurt. The doctors were, everything about it. And we’re going to go back just before the election, sometime in October. It’s already being worked on. And I’ll probably start off by saying, “As I was saying.” So you stand up, as I was saying.
(26:54)
I gave Kamala and Crooked Joe a world at peace, and their weakness and incompetence quickly brought us to the brink of a global war. America cannot survive for four more years of this bumbling, communist lunatic. Look, we cannot let her win this election. It’s not a question to me. We can’t let her win this election. If she wins this election, we’re not going to have a country anymore.
(27:16)
Starting on day one, we will bring competence and common sense back to the Oval Office. We’re really a party of common sense, if you think. We’re conservative and all that, but we’re really a party of common sense. And by the way, we have a great libertarian with us tonight. Where is our libertarian friend? And I think he’s going to be with us. Where is he? What a nice guy. Sit. Wait, stand up, please. Stand up. What a nice guy. What a nice guy. A lot of us are libertarian, and I think he’s going to be giving you a very nice surprise very soon. But he’s a great, wonderful person, and we just met, and we knew each other a little bit from before. Thank you very much for being here. How do you like the audience? Not bad. Do you think the libertarians get this kind of an audience? I don’t think so. But, thank you. Great honor to know you. Thank you very much.
(28:17)
But we’ll bring back safety, security and the American dream, bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. If you want a preview of what a catastrophe another term of Kamala will be, and she was there. She was there. She was working with him. She was the border czar. Now, she doesn’t say she’s the border czar, she said, “I was never the border czar.” Everything they did, she’s taking away now, but she was the border czar. She was the worst border czar in the history of the world. There’s never been a border like this, that allows millions and millions of people in a month, from mental institutions and prisons, let them come into our country. Just look at who she chose for her vice president. She went with the handpicked candidate of crazy Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders wanted him so badly, and the Democratic Socialist of America immediately gave him the endorsement.
(29:09)
Forget him. That’s her thinking. That’s where she’s going to go. A politician, when they came out, if Steve Daines came out and said, 20 years ago when he started, “I want to defund the police,” I don’t think he’s saying that. “I want to defund the police, everybody.” Then he said, “Well, I was only kidding. I don’t.” The truth is, when you come out with a statement like that, that’s where you are. And she wants to defund the police, and she wants to have all of your guns taken away. She wants your guns taken away.
(29:43)
You can count on it. A politician, their first statement, Steve, is always the statement. Now, Steve said, “I’m going to protect your second amendment.” That was a long time ago. He said, “I’m going to take care of our police.” Right, Steve? I just don’t want to leave any question in their mind, Steve. He’s so happy I did that little second part. He said, “Oh my God. They might think I want to defund.” No, Steve is never, he’s not a big defunder. He’s an increaser for the police. We want to take care of our police. They’re doing a great job, right?
(30:18)
As Minnesota’s governor, Tim Walz let rioters and looters burn down Minneapolis. Remember CNN? They’re right back there. Watch. Oh, there goes their light. Their light just went off. While the governor’s wife opened the windows to the mansion to enjoy the smell of the fire, she said, “The smell is so beautiful. I love it.” I wonder where she’s coming from. Walz said that socialism is just another word for neighborliness. She wants to be. He calls them neighbors, good neighbors. He signed a bill to give illegal aliens free healthcare. He abolished Columbus Day. He ordered tampons to be put into boys’ bathrooms.
(31:06)
Do we have any children here? Please close your ears. He ordered tampons in boys’ bathrooms. Okay? He signed a law letting the state kidnap children to change their gender, so that they go home and… But I’m not talking about him. I’m talking about her. This is her ideology. That’s why she picked him. And he signed a bill allowing pedophiles to claim human rights protections under the state law. And then he said, by the way, J.D Vance is doing a phenomenal job. But then he said, well, think of that, think of the things I just said. Then he said, “I think J.D Vance is weird.” It’s a word that they use. I think he calls me that too. No, we’re not weird. We’re very solid people. We want to have strong borders. We want to have good elections. We want to have low interest rates. We want to be able to buy a house. We want great education. We want strong borders.
(32:10)
I think we’re very, actually, I think we’re the opposite of weird. They’re weird. You know what they do? They work with the press on coming up with a sound bite. Just a sound bite. And every station that night, all the networks, CBS, ABC, NBC, they all said, “Oh, they were called weird. Weird.” It just, it’s unbelievable. It’s not a word that’s really used too much in politics, but it’s a terrible thing that they can do this. It’s just a sound bite. No, J.D Vance is a great patriot and he’s a United States Marine, and he’s a real Marine and he’s a brilliant guy. And he went to Ohio State. He graduated in two years at the top of his class, just about at the top of his class. And he then got into Yale and he became a Marine. He got into Yale and he did great at Yale, and he met his wife, who was actually, I think the number one student at Yale. They have a smart family.
(33:08)
And we picked somebody that was very special and he’s really stepped up. I said, “You got your sea legs.” Because the first day they were hitting him with a lot of nonsense, and he’s got his sea legs now. He’s going to be great. Don’t we like him? And he’s for the working man and woman. Tim Walz is the man who’s very freakish. He’s very freakish. If Comrade Walz and Comrade Harris win this November, the people cheering will be the pink-haired Marxists, the looters, the perverts, the flag-burners, Hamas supporters, drug dealers, gun grabbers, and human traffickers. But with a Trump fans victory, the cheers will come from the police officers, the firefighters, the border patrol agents, the steelworkers, small business owners, parents, and hardworking citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.
(34:08)
And that’s what we’re doing. We’re getting record numbers, record numbers in the Hispanic community, record numbers in so many different communities. Nobody’s ever actually seen, this is the greatest movement in the history of our country. You do know that. Remember, they used to say, “No, no, no. MAGA is a good solid 35% of the party.” No, no, it’s 95% of the party, not 35%. They used to say that. They’re very cunning people. MAGA is 35. 35, really? No, it’s 95% of the party, and I think it’s probably 90%, I think the whole country. Who can want, think of it, who wants open borders? Who wants men playing in women’s sports?
(34:56)
And I’d like to congratulate the young woman who transitioned from a man into a boxer. You saw he won. She won the gold medal. How about the young Italian? Beautiful Italian boxer. She got in there and she didn’t know what was going on. And she was a very good boxer against other women. She didn’t count on this. And he’s up here. Boom. One little jab. Whoa. She goes, “Nobody ever hit me that way.” Then he goes, boom. And she said, “Okay, I had enough.” It’s crazy what they’re doing. And this person won the gold medal. Did they win the gold medal today? What do you think of that, Tim? I don’t think Tim likes it. Greg, no good, right?
(35:38)
Now, how crazy is it? How crazy is it for four more years? Crazy. And she wants it, she wants men to play in women’s sports. She wants to take away your guns, all of this stuff. And now she’s going to deny it. Watch. She’ll come out with a statement. She’ll deny it. Remember one thing, I’m going to say it again later, because it’s so important. No tax on tips. Do we like that? And they’re just the opposite. They’re driving people crazy. And our seniors, our senior citizens, we’re not going to have them pay tax any longer on social security. Those two things.
(36:18)
Four more years of crazy Kamala Harris, probably it means 50 million illegal aliens pouring into our country over another four years. 50 million. 50 million, could be 50 million more. They’re overrunning our country. They’re destroying our country. They’re ruining our country, and they’re making our country very unsafe. These are very tough people. These are criminals coming out of jails. These are people that are tough. The only good thing about them is they make our criminals look like weak sisters. That’s it. These are really tough, nasty people, and we can’t have it. We all have a heart, but we can’t have it. It means double-digit inflation decimating your savings, and your savings are being decimated. I know what you’re going through. It means violent crime ripping through the suburbs. They talk about women. I think suburban women like me a lot. It’s fake stuff. Why wouldn’t they? Why wouldn’t they?
(37:17)
I put something in, when I was president. There will be no low-income housing developments built in areas that are right next to your house. You have a house in the suburbs, you’re so proud. And then they want to build a low-income job with a thirty-story building next to your house. And your house is worthless. And I stopped it. And then they say, “Well, I don’t think suburban women like them.” I think they like me. I’m going to keep criminals out of your neighborhood. That’s really all that matters. I think they like me anyway. You are not going to have migrant criminals preying on our women and our girls, while guns are confiscated from the law-abiding citizens. They want to take away your guns. And then they want to have our country overrun with some of the worst criminals there are anywhere in the world.
(38:06)
And they come from all over the world. They come from Africa, they come from Asia, they come from the Middle East. They come from all over. A large boatload came recently from the Congo. Where do you come from? Where in the Congo? Prison. What did you do wrong? We do not want to say. Murder. It was murder. And they’re dumping them into our country. The money they’re saving, these other countries, their prison population is way down, the money they’re saving they’ve never had it so good. And if I were running any of those countries, if I were running Colombia, if I were running Brazil, if I were, I’d be doing the same thing, but I’d be doing it faster than they’re doing it. Why wouldn’t you do it? It’s common sense. Dump all of your criminals.
(38:51)
In Venezuela crime is down 72%. You know why? Because he took all of the criminals out of Caracas and out of all the cities, he took all of them out and dumped them into the United States. He emptied his prisons into the United States of America. Why are we taking this? Why do we take this? Why? So don’t take my word for it. Listen, Kamala Harris’s agenda, straight from her own mouth. Would anybody like to see her? Let’s do it for a couple of seconds. Go ahead.

Kamala Harris (39:21):

Yeah. I am radical. We need to get radical about what we are doing and take it seriously. As President of the United States, I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster to pass a green new deal. There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking. We have to have a buyback program, and I support a mandatory buyback program.

Speaker 1 (39:42):

I believe it will totally eliminate private insurance.

Kamala Harris (39:47):

Let’s eliminate all of that.

Speaker 2 (39:50):

But would you support changing the dietary guidelines, the food pyramid?

Kamala Harris (39:55):

Yes. Yes.

Speaker 2 (39:56):

Reduce red meat specifically.

Kamala Harris (39:57):

Yes, I would.

Speaker 2 (40:00):

Raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.

Speaker 1 (40:08):

Where do you stand on defund the police?

Kamala Harris (40:10):

This whole movement is about rightly saying we need to take a look at these budgets.

Speaker 3 (40:16):

Harris asserted that ICE is perceived as the modern-day Ku Klux Klan.

Kamala Harris (40:22):

Are you aware that there’s a perception-

Speaker 1 (40:24):

I see no-

Kamala Harris (40:25):

Are you aware that there’s a perception-

Speaker 1 (40:26):

That puts ICE in the same category as the KKK. Is that what you’re asking me? I see no parallel.

Kamala Harris (40:31):

I’m not finished.

Speaker 1 (40:32):

I see none.

Kamala Harris (40:35):

Eddie, I am radical. We need to get radical about what we are doing.

Donald Trump (40:44):

And that’s just a small part of it. That’s just a small part. That’s what we have though. That’s where they’re going. We’re going… Remember I said we will not become a socialist country? And I meant it. Except, I was wrong. We didn’t become a socialist, we’re going beyond socialism. We’re becoming, if they get in, a full-blown communist country. This is America. We’re not a communist country. We’re not going to let that happen.
(41:19)
And Kamala is not just… She’s not just dangerously extreme. And she is extreme, much more so than Biden. Because Biden didn’t know he was alive. Let’s face it, okay. Are you a socialist? What does that mean? What does it mean? Are you a communist, Joe? I don’t know. So he was sort of dangerous, because the people around the Resolute desk ran the country. Don’t forget, he went after me. He weaponized government to go after me. I don’t believe it was him. I believe it was the people circle. I could name every one of them. They’re bad people. And we won our big case in Florida. Great, brilliant judge that was so smart and strong. And she didn’t listen to the nonsense.
(42:03)
And they play the ref with judges. They criticize them all the time, scream at them, treat them horribly. Justices, the justices of the Supreme Court, all judges, and they think they’re playing the ref like the great Bobby Knight, right? Play the ref. No. They’re not putting up with it anymore. What they are doing is, in my opinion, totally illegal. Kamala is grossly incompetent and in my opinion has a very low IQ. But we’ll find out about her IQ during the debate. Okay, let’s find out about her IQ.
(42:39)
So we have this great system. I want to show you just one other thing, please. Do you mind putting it up, please? Thank you.

Kamala Harris (42:46):

We’ve been to the border.

Speaker 4 (42:47):

You haven’t been to the border.

Kamala Harris (42:49):

And I haven’t been to Europe. And I don’t understand the point that you’re making. Talking about the significance of the passage of time, right? The significance of the passage of time. So when you think about it, there is great significance to the passage of time.
(43:05)
Ukraine is a country in Europe. It exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. So, basically, that’s wrong.
(43:22)
So no longer are you necessarily keeping those private files in some file cabinet that’s locked in the basement of the house. It’s on your laptop, and it’s then therefore up here in this cloud that exists above us, right?
(43:41)
The Caribbean nations, island nations, in the Western Hemisphere. That is where the Caribbean is. We are also in the Western Hemisphere. They are our neighbors. I’m here, standing here on the northern flank, on the eastern flank, talking about what we have in terms of the eastern flank.
(44:01)
I can imagine what can be and be unburdened by what has been.
(44:06)
Space is exciting.
(44:07)
It is time for us to do what we have been doing. And that time is every day. Every day, it is time for us to agree that there are things and tools that are available to us to slow this thing down. We will work together and continue to work together to address these issues, to tackle these challenges, and to work together as we continue to work.

Speaker 2 (44:33):

Do you ban plastic straws?

Kamala Harris (44:35):

I think we should. Yes. I mean, look, I’m going to be honest. It’s really difficult to drink out of a paper straw when you, if you don’t gulp it down immediately it starts to bend and then the little thing catches it. So we got to kind of perfect that one a little bit more.
(44:53)
Do you know, okay, a bit of a history lesson. Do you know that the women’s teams were not allowed to have brackets until 2022?
(45:03)
So the United States shares a very important relationship, which is an alliance with the Republic of North Korea.
(45:11)
AI is kind of a fancy thing, first of all, it’s two letters. It means artificial intelligence.
(45:17)
As a woman, there is a balance to be struck between being tough and being a [inaudible 00:45:34]. Turn that off.

Donald Trump (45:46):

So if you listen to Kamala’s speeches, you’d never even know that she’s been running the country. She’s been running the country for four years and doing a horrible job. Look at what’s happened to our country. We are a failing nation. I hate to say it. We are a failing nation. I wish I didn’t have to do this. I wish I didn’t have to go and do this. I wish they were great. I wish they’d make our country great. But they’re going to destroy our country. You know it. They even know it. And probably they’re doing it on purpose. It’s hard to believe, but they’re probably doing it on purpose. Kamala is working full-time to erase her record of open borders, transgender anything. High energy costs, taxes, interest rates, which are at sky levels, rising crime rates, and wars all over the world. We’re in wars all over the world. When I left, we had nothing. We had no wars. The world respected your country. We had no wars.
(46:48)
Viktor Orbán, who is the prime minister, the boss, of Hungary and knows everything very well, they asked him, “What’s wrong? The world is breaking out and war is all over.” He said, “There’s one thing wrong. The United States needs Donald Trump back as president, and if you have that, you’re okay.” Which is true. You won’t have any of these problems. You won’t have any of these problems. Russia would’ve never, ever attacked Ukraine. Israel would never have been attacked on October 7th. And you wouldn’t have inflation, and you wouldn’t have had the horrible Afghanistan embarrassment, the most embarrassing day, I think, in the history of our country.
(47:28)
On election day, we’re going to tell this radical left country buster, she’s a country buster, that we’ve had enough. We can’t take it anymore. We’re going to say, Kamala Harris, you’re fired. You’ve done a horrible job. You’re fired. Get out of here. Get out. Get the hell out of here, Kamala. Right? If Kamala wins, foreign leaders will treat America’s president as a joke. They already do. Now we have two jokes. Think of it. What’s going to happen? Russia gets a little nasty. China, President Xi, I know him very well, got along with him very well until Covid, in which case I said, “That’s the end of that.”
(48:14)
But President Xi, these are fierce people. These are fierce people. They don’t even know who the head of our country is. Who do we have? Are we dealing with Biden? Biden probably should get out, but she should get out also. I think they should both get out. I’ll tell you what, do we have a volunteer? Yes, I will volunteer. We have to straighten out. We have to straighten out our country. They’re not going to do it. They will rip us off more than ever before.
(48:43)
These foreign countries are ripping us off at levels that you’ve never seen before. And we had them held back. Russia respected us. China respected us. I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China. No other president took in not 10 cents. For years, they ripped us off. And our country will never be given a chance for a future. We are never going to have a future back if we don’t solve this problem now. We can’t go like this any longer. We’re not going to have a country any longer.
(49:14)
When I win, we’re going to win. When I win, America will be respected again because you will once again have a president who puts America first, and you have a president who will fight, fight, fight. Thank you.
(49:39)
Thank you.
(49:44)
For four incredible years under our administration, I stood up for America and we achieved more than any administration in the history of our country. There’s never been a period of time like we had for four years. There’s never been. And then we had Covid, and we got rid of it.

Donald Trump (50:00):

We never got… You know, I got great credit for the economy, great credit for the military. We defeated ISIS rapidly. I started no wars. First time in 78 years I started no… We didn’t have any wars. These endless wars, they keep going and going. People getting killed all over the place, spending billions and billions.
(50:20)
We passed the largest tax cuts and regulation cuts in the history of our country. We achieved record-low unemployment rates, record-low poverty rates, and rising wages for everybody. Everybody in this room your wages increased, your money increased, your businesses increased. Whatever you do, everything was better for four years. We unlocked American energy independence and soon would’ve been energy dominant. We were going to be energy dominant. We took on the globalists and corrupt special interests. We ended the NAFTA disaster conceal. And think of that, we got out of TPP. Do you know what TP… If you want to have manufacturing in this country, they were going to take it all away. Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP. We took it away.
(51:07)
We withdrew from the horrible Paris Climate Accord. It sounds so nice. I want the Montana Climate Accord, not the Paris Climate Accord. And stood up to China like never before, bringing in tens of billions of dollars. Think of it though, no other president ever brought up, they never confronted China. And China respected us. We built 571 miles of border wall and we took it out, we took it out of our military because Congress was impossible. So I said, “We’re taking it out of our military because it’s an invasion of our country.” That worked. They sued me all over the place. We won. We ended catch-and-release. We stopped asylum fraud. We brought illegal immigration to the lowest level ever recorded. That’s per your chart.
(51:57)
We fully rebuilt the US military and created a thing called Space Force, which is so important. And now we are leading in space. Nobody thought that was possible. And for our great veterans, of which you have a lot, you have a lot in your great state, we passed VA Accountability and VA Choice, right? They’ve been trying to get them for 50 years. Accountability is you get rid of the sadists and the bad people that took advantage and harmed our heroes, our great people. They beat them up. They were sadists, they were thieves. There were a lot of bad things. We had no right under civil service and other things to fire them. If we caught them stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars, you couldn’t do anything about it. I got a law passed in Congress. We got rid of 9,000 bad people and hired people that love our veterans.
(52:52)
And then on choice. So we have some great doctors in the VA, but you couldn’t get to them. It would take sometimes months. People would be a little bit ill and they’d end up becoming terminally ill because you couldn’t get to the doctors. If you had to wait more than one day for a doctor, I allowed you to go out, get a local doctor, get yourself taken care of, and we pay for the bill. And Steve Daines helped a lot on that. Actually, Steve, that was a great thing. And we had a 92% approval rating at the VA, the Veterans Administration, 92%. That was the highest rating ever. Now it’s down into the 40s, down into the 40s.
(53:40)
We obliterated ISIS. And unlike Harris, we stood up and we took care of our friend Israel. We have a problem over there. Big problem. We have a lot of people, we have a lot of people that are looking to destroy Israel. Look, the bottom line, we got to get peace over in the Middle East. The Middle East is blowing up and largely because our country doesn’t know what’s happening. They have no idea what’s happening. We are going to take care of it. We did the Abraham Accords. It brought peace to the Middle East. We would’ve had every country signed up right now. If the election weren’t rigged, we would’ve had every single country signed up right now. And I’m proud to be the first president in decades who really… And I talk about it as much as I can because Hillary Clinton stood on the stage, they said, “Look at him. He’s going to start wars.” And I said, “No, no. No, no. I’m going to stop the wars. You’re the one that started the wars. You people, the stupid people started the war.”
(54:41)
But I did finish the war on ISIS. And everybody said we could never, we couldn’t beat ISIS, too malleable, too all over the place. Did it in four weeks. We knocked it out. And that’s where I learned we have a great military. We don’t have a woke military. We have some stupid people on the top that are woke. We have a great military. What they did for me against ISIS was incredible.
(55:03)
Four years ago, America’s future was blazing bright and Kamala and Crooked Joe came in and drove our country off the cliff. They’ve taken our country to levels. We’re being laughed at all over the world. All over the word they’re laughing at America, they’re laughing at your United States. But with your vote, the reign will be over, that horrible reign of, in a way, it’s a reign of terror. It’s a weak reign, it’s an incompetent reign. But they want to put good people in jail that shouldn’t be in jail. It’s a very dangerous reign actually, and people aren’t going to take it. It’s a very dangerous reign led by very incompetent people. New era of strength and prosperity and freedom will soon ring true. The moment I take the oath of office, we will seal the border, stop the invasion, and send the illegal aliens back home where they belong. Under the so-called Border Czar Harris, illegal aliens are stampeding into America by the millions and millions. They’re coming from prisons. They’re coming from jails. They’re coming from all over the place. They’re coming from countries we’ve never even heard of, most of the people in this room have never heard. They’re coming from some very bad places, evil places. Every day Kamala is letting migrant criminals roam free to assault, rape, mutilate, and kill our citizens. Look at what’s happening to our cities. Our cities are being overrun and they’re being taken care of and our veterans are not being take… Our veterans are forced to sleep on the street and these people are given hotel rooms in luxury hotels.
(56:51)
Right here in Bozeman, an illegal alien brutally stabbed to death a 19-year-old young man. You know all about it. And when the police searched the illegal’s car, they found three handguns, two rifles, a shotgun, and a record as long as your arm. On July 4th, a 42-year-old Nashville man died after he tried to stop an illegal alien from stealing tools out of his truck. The illegal alien did a number on this man that nobody could even believe. The police officer said one of the most vicious crimes they’ve ever seen. He was thrown from the hood of the illegal’s pickup truck and left to die in the street after being beat to hell. And last month, a Venezuelan illegal alien criminal led in by our so-called Border Czar. The Border Czar is a joke. She never went to the border. She never went to the border. Shot a female police officer in Texas multiple times with a rifle and started shooting over and over again.
(57:54)
The choice in this election is between a mass amnesty with welfare, Social Security, and voting rights for the illegal. And they want to give illegal immigrants all of this. And here’s all we’re going to do. It’s going to be called a Trump mass deportation because we have no choice. We have no choice. We have no choice. If Harris wins, a never-ending stream of illegal alien rapists, MS-13 animals and child predators will ravage your communities. They’re already ravaging your community. Don’t forget they haven’t been here that long. They’re getting used to it. When they get used to it, they’re going to be coming at you at levels that nobody’s ever seen before. We have a new form of crime. It’s called migrant crime, and it’s going to be as vicious as any crime ever seen in this country before. And it’s a guarantee.
(58:52)
In addition, we have hundreds and hundreds of terrorists in our country that have been allowed in. We didn’t allow them in. We had a strong border. We had one year where Border Patrol actually said under Trump in 2019, one year, one of our four years, zero terrorists. Now, I don’t really believe that because I don’t believe that’s possible. But they have it down as a zero. Zero terrorists were able to get into our country. Now we have hundreds and hundreds of people coming in, thousands of people coming in. And these are the world’s worst terrorists. And it’s 100% certain that really bad things are going to happen. So we don’t have a choice.
(59:33)
Vote Republican and we will begin the largest deportation operation in American history. And I don’t say that with fondness. I don’t even know. I don’t say that with… I don’t even know if that’s good politics or bad politics. People would say, “Oh, Trump is too tough. We don’t like him. We don’t like him. He’s taken murderers out of our country, but we don’t like him. He shouldn’t be taking murderers out of our country.” The truth is Dwight Eisenhower, he was a sort of a moderate type of guy. General Eisenhower, he was president. Do you know when he was president, he was the strongest president in history outside of what we did, the strongest in history on the border? He hated when people came into our country illegally. And we want people to come into our country, but they have to come into through a process. They have to come in legally. We want people. Harris has let them all in and we will send them all back. We have to send them back to their countries. Their country, when I came in, we had a lot of MS-13 gang members. They’re probably the toughest gang in the world. Really ruthless people. And I came in, I said, “We got to get them out.” I told one of the generals, “Sir, they won’t let us have them in.” Under President Obama, the countries where they came from, Honduras and Guatemala and all over the place they come, from South America in this case, the countries said we’re not letting them back in. And they would put major aircraft, big airplane on the runway. So if we were coming in with a plane, you couldn’t land, they’d come back. They blocked up the road, so if we bused them in, if we took them in by ship, anyway we took them in, they wouldn’t let them back.
(01:01:15)
So the general told me that, “Sir, I’m sorry, we can’t get them back. They’ll never take them back. They don’t want them back.” Ms-13 gang members, who can blame them, right? So I said, “How much money do we pay them?” He goes, “Sir, we pay them $750 million a year, sir.” I said, “All right, inform the countries that they’re delinquent. They’re not taking their criminals back. They’re sending criminals in,” they send them into the caravans, they put some really bad types in the caravans and they pour in by the thousands, “that we’re not paying them anymore. We’re ending it on day one.” I signed a document.
(01:01:51)
The next day I come into the beautiful Oval Office, so beautiful, resolute desk, I sit down, “Sir, we have a call from Guatemala.” “Sir, we have a call from Mexico.” “We have a call from…. We have all these calls and they call and they wanted to know, “Sir, we understand there’s a misunderstanding.” I said, “No, no, why? There’s no misunderstanding. You’re sending your criminals into our country and you’re not taking them back. And I’m not paying you any more. You’re not getting any more subsidy from the United States of America.”
(01:02:24)
And they all said the same thing. The calls came in early in the morning. They all said the same thing. “Sir, there must be a much misunderstanding. There’s a misunderstanding, sir. We would love to have MS-13 back in our country. We love them very much, sir. They’re wonderful people.” And we took tens of thousands, we took thousands and thousands out. Believe it or not, there were a lot on Long Island. You read the story where they killed two beautiful 16-year-old girls walking into school and they killed them with a knife. They sliced them up into little pieces. You know why? Because that’s much more painful than getting shot. And they wanted to. What they did, they were animals. And who took care of it? ICE. And all of these people like Kamala, they want to abandon ICE. They want to drop ICE.
(01:03:10)
These guys are so incredible. They’re brave. I know some of the people in the front row and they’re really tough guys, and they’re brave guys, and I know them pretty well. They don’t want to work for ICE. ICE would get in, there’d get up to the gangs in Ohio and a lot of them in New York and amazing, as I said in Long Island. And they’d walk into a gang of 15 of the toughest guys you’ve ever seen and you’d see fists and feet and back and forth and it would go on for three, four minutes. And then the ICE guys would get up and they’d take these guys into a paddy wagon, put them in and would bring them back to their country. And then she wants to get rid of ICE. These are incredible patriots. They’re tough people and they love our country as much as anybody and maybe more than most.
(01:03:57)
One of the most sinister accomplices in Kamala’s plot to demolish American borders has been her ally, the partner in the US senate, one of the biggest phonies in American politics. His name is Jon Tester. And I don’t speak badly about somebody’s physical disability, but he’s got the biggest stomach I have ever seen. I swear. That’s the biggest stomach. I have never seen a stomach like that. Because he doesn’t look that heavy. You’re not allowed to use the word fat. So if you use the word fat, you can say obese, you can say anything, but you can’t say fat that’s the end of your political career.
(01:04:48)
I said it the other night, somebody in the audience said Chris Christie is a fat pig. And I said, “Sir, Chris Christie is not a fat pig. You should not.” And we argued about it for three or four minutes, and that was it. No, he’s not a fat pig. For years, Tester has been telling Montana that he’s a moderate. Well, he votes with Biden, Harris and Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas. You remember Pocahontas? Pocahontas, I have more Indian blood in me than she has in her, and I have none. I happen to have none.
(01:05:28)
But Kamala votes with them 100% of the time. Did you know that, Steve? 100% of the time. I promise you, Tim will not be voting 100%. He may vote with them zero. I would say zero would be close. But in a 50-50 Senate, Tester could have single-handedly stopped the invasion of our country, but he voted against stopping it. Instead, Tester voted for mass amnesty. He voted against the border wall, totally voted against the wall. Who the hell would vote against the wall?
(01:06:02)
He voted against Remain in Mexico. Remember, I had the policy, the greatest policy of all. You couldn’t come into our country, you had a remain. They had hundreds of thousands of people that came up from the south, hundreds of thousands, they couldn’t get into our country. He ended it and these people came in. You think it was easy to get that deal with Mexico? It was very tough. I had to say, “I’m got to put a lot of tariffs on,” they give it to me or not. They were very nice. It was amazing. They wouldn’t give it to me. They said, “No, sir, we won’t do that.” I said, “All right. I’m going to tariff your cars at 100%.” “Sir, we’d love to give you that. We would love a policy of remain in Mexico. We think it’s wonderful.”
(01:06:41)
You ought to see Tijuana. Tijuana was the fastest-growing city in the history of the world. They were having hundreds of thousands of people pour into Tijuana, but they couldn’t come into our country because I said to Mexico, “You can stop them. You can stop them at your southern border down below.” And you know those caravans, I think I came up with that name, but they are a caravan, they’re very horrible, very dangerous for women, very dangerous. Women die all the time. They’re being raped, they’re dying. The whole thing is a horror show.
(01:07:16)
He voted against Title 42. That’s a bad one. He voted against increasing funding for ICE. He voted to provide the deciding vote to shield illegal alien criminals like the one who murdered Laken Riley from deportation. He didn’t want the person deported. He didn’t want any deportation for that person.
(01:07:36)
If you elect Jon Tester, you are approving the Harris plan to make the 20 million Biden illegals into voting citizens. She said today she wants to give them the right to vote. Many of these people are killers and criminals. They’re not going to have the right to vote and they’re not going to destroy our country. She also voted to give them welfare, government healthcare, and let them raid Medicare and Social Security until there is nothing left. They will destroy Social Security. I will save your Social Security with no increase in age or anything else.
(01:08:24)
Jon Tester cast the decisive vote to approve every single bill that caused record inflation. Remember the Inflation Reduction Act? It was a phony. They used the term inflation reduction. It was actually an inflation increase act. It was a disaster. But they lied because that’s what they’re good at. They’re con people. You know what they are? Misinformation, disinformation. After they got the bill passed, which they shouldn’t have had, trillions of dollars, inflation went through the roof. He cast the vote to kill the Keystone XL Pipeline. Do you remember that? The Keystone… What the hell are these reporters doing over here? Oh, Pulitzer Prize winner.
(01:09:10)
Doug Mills, the great Doug Mills, Pulitzer Prize. Even though he works for The New York Times, that’s okay. He works for The New York Times. And that’s one of the only Pulitzer Prizes that was actually earned. How [inaudible 01:09:23] Maggot Hagerman. Did you ever hear of it? Maggot Hagerman. She’s a reporter. She pretends like she knows more about Trump. I have nothing to do, if the woman speaks to me once in a year. Today I called her, I said, “Your stories are all fake. Why don’t you stop it?” But think of it, they have a man here who I really like. He’s a great photographer. Doug, it’s nice to have you. Make me look nice and thin if you don’t mind.
(01:09:54)
He voted for environmental extremist Tracy Stone-Manning to lead the Bureau of Land Management. And he voted the radical left Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, you know who that is, don’t you, to wage war on your rights and on your industries. And they really did wage war. But we have a man here, and I’m going to introduce some of your people, but we have a man here who knows Tester better than I do, better than anybody does. And Tester and I have nothing to do with each other. And when you watch his commercials, you can forget it. He never votes for me. He voted to impeach me. That guy voted to impeach me, stomach brimming out like a big slob. “Do you want to…” “I want to impeach.” “Why?” “I don’t know. What did he do wrong?” I did nothing wrong. But I have to tell you, the Republicans stuck with me, and we won very easily. We beat it.
(01:10:47)
But there’s a man named Ronnie Jackson. He comes from Texas and he heard it was a race against Tester, and he was treated so unfairly. Could I ask congressman, admiral, doctor… He’s a doctor. He was my White House doctor. He was Obama’s White House doctor and Bush’s White House doctor. He was also an admiral. So he was an admiral and a doctor. Then he became the doctor in the White House. And you know when I fell in love with him, they said, “Who’s the healthiest?” He took care of Bush, Obama. Did anybody ever hear of Barack Hussein Obama? Yes. Took care of Obama. And he took care of Trump. And they said, “Who’s the healthiest of those presidents? And he said, “Without question, it’s Donald J. Trump.” And I said, “I love this guy.” Ronnie Jackson.

Ronnie Jackson (01:11:40):

Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. Howdy, Montana from the great state of Texas. All right. Look, I want to tell you a little bit about this man, Jon Tester, this man who says that he represents Montana in the Senate. This man who tells you that he’s up there trying to clean the place up and trying to fix what’s broken. This man is a sleazy, disgusting, swamp politician. He’s a fraud and he’s a liar.
(01:12:09)
I was in the Navy for 25 years. For 25 years I was on active duty serving my country. I was an emergency medicine physician, right? I went to Iraq with the United States Marine Corps to a surgical shock trauma platoon on the battlefield between Fallujah and Ramadi. I spent the last 14 years of my career in the Navy on active duty at the White House serving three presidential administrations and taking care of three presidents, including the best president this country’s ever had, Donald J. Trump.
(01:12:51)
I had a spotless, spotless, flawless career in the Navy. I had never had a single complaint about anything. I was a navy rear admiral. And at the end of my time in the military, while I was still on active duty, President Trump had the trust and confidence in me to nominate me as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, which I was happy to…
(01:13:14)
However, let me tell you, Jon Tester at that time was the ranking member on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. He was going to oversee that process. He was also up for reelection. It was 2018. He decided that it was in his political best interest and would help his election if he could come out and be the guy that tore down one of Donald Trump’s cabinet nominees. He came after me. He tried to destroy me. He tried to destroy my family. He got together with some disgruntled employees that worked for me at the White House who were upset because they didn’t get promoted or get something they wanted during their time at the White House. One of them, in fact, is currently Joe Biden’s doctor.
(01:14:03)
They got together with him and his staff and they made up completely absurd accusations and lies about me to tear down my nomination. He labeled me on TV as the candy man, right? He said that I was recklessly prescribing narcotics. I can tell you, I can count right here on this hand right here, how many times I prescribed narcotics at the White House in 14 years. He put that out there. He said that I got drunk and wrecked a government vehicle. Any two-bit investigator can figure out whether or not that happened. He knew it didn’t happen. He knew it. And it’s been proven that it didn’t happen since then. He did not care. He was going to destroy me to better his career. And he passed that information to these morons in the back, the mainstream media who were all too willing to carry this water. And let me tell you, they don’t work for you. They work

Ronnie Jackson (01:15:00):

… worked for swamp creatures like Jon Tester. That’s who they work for. Anyways, look, this man tried to destroy me. He tried to destroy my family. I’ve been waiting for six years to get back here for this night, to be with this man right here to come after him. The end of Jon Tester starts tonight, and it starts by bringing this man back to the White House so that he can continue the work that he did, draining the swamp when he was the president before. He’s the best president we’ve ever had, and he’s the only one that can do the job now. So get him back into office. The next thing we’re going to do is we’re going to bring Tim Sheehy to the Senate to replace this swamp hippopotamus, Jon Tester. So I want to thank you all for coming out and for showing your support and your willingness to help us take this country back. We’ve got 87 days left. Let’s get it done.

Donald Trump (01:16:26):

Great job. Other than that, he likes him very much. Look, I maybe blame myself. I said to her, “He was a great admiral, highly respected the Navy. He was a great White House doctor.” So you have two, you have leadership and you have the doctor. So I figured what’s better for the VA? So I went to Ronny and I said, “Ronny, what do you think of the possibility of you running the VA? You’re a great leader. You’re a great admiral, highly respected in the Navy, a war veteran, everything?” He had everything you could have. And on top of that, he’s a great doctor, a great man, a great personality. Everyone loves him. And I went to him. I said, “What do you think?” And he didn’t want it. He said, “Sir, I’d rather not,” but he’s an incredible patriot. He said, “But if you want me to do it,” because he was ready to retire and go on to move to Texas and do whatever he was going to do, he said, “If you want me to do it, sir, I’ll do it.”
(01:17:25)
He didn’t want to do it. Everybody else would want it, but he really would’ve preferred not. I said, “Ronny,” I did him such a great favor, “Ronny, you’ll be great.” So I let it out that I’d like to put Ron… I didn’t even put it out officially. I let it out to the fake news. I said, “I’d like to put Ronny in as the head of the Veterans Administration,” and that’s when tests are hit. And it was vicious. It was vicious. It was really… And I didn’t even say it. After it happened, I said, “Ronny, it’s unfair.” And they sent out people, and we did too, to investigate every charge this slob made. And every charge was totally false. And he has an incredible family, an incredible wife. He has a son. I was making the commencement address at Annapolis. His son was one of the best students at Annapolis, right at the top of the class. And I had a look at the son and I had to say, “What they’re doing to your father is really unfair.” This is one of the finest men you’ll ever see. And that Jon Tester couldn’t have cared less. He just wanted publicity for himself, and it’s a disgrace. You have to defeat Jon Tester. I’m telling you. You have to defeat. You have to do it.
(01:18:42)
And when Ronny heard what I was doing, he said, “Oh, you’re going to Montana. Does that have anything to do with Tester?” I said, “Actually it does. We tried…” He said, “May I go?” He was in Texas, so he had to travel longer than I did. But Ronny Jackson’s one of the finest men. And it was a shame and really a shame. And you ought to get rid of that guy. He’s bad news.
(01:19:09)
Montana, you’ve got to do it and you’re going to do it. And I want to bring up, if I could, you heard him, but just for a second, because I want to shake his hand. He’s a spectacular person. He was picked by Steve Daines and a group of people. We were looking for perfection because we didn’t want any excuses. The fact that he’s handsome should have nothing to do with it, but he is a handsome guy. But he’s got everything. He’s highly successful, great education, Purple Heart recipient, a former Navy SEAL, which as you know is a big deal. It’s a tough thing to be, a combat veteran at the highest level, a bronze star. His really is valor. It’s Valor for Heroism Award. The other one talks about valor. He has a different kind of a valor. It’s the opposite. But Tim Sheehy is going to be an outstanding senator. He was a great businessman, an aerospace company. He started it in a barn in Montana, right here. Employed a lot of people, turned it into a big success. And I’d like to ask just to say a few words real quickly. Tim Sheehy, you’ve got to vote for him. Thank you. Come on up.

Tim Sheehy (01:20:37):

Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. It’s an honor to have you here. Listen, I always supported the Trump policies. I never knew the man, but I supported the policies, no question. But I became a true follower of his about four years ago. For those of us who fought in the Middle East, we knew who we were really fighting the whole time. It was Iran. They were murdering us. They’ve been murdering Americans for 45 years. They were blowing us up with EFPs. They were sending their hit teams across the border and killing us so we could never cross back over and get them. We could never touch them. It was a one-way fight. And in the Obama years, those of you who were there, you know our hands were tied. I had to watch these guys get killed and sent home in boxes, and we couldn’t do anything about it. And that was so frustrating. It made me sick.
(01:21:20)
And a few years ago when we were fighting ISIS, Trump told the Iranians, “Don’t touch any Americans. We’re here to fight ISIS. You touch one hair on any American’s head, we’re going to kill you.” And they didn’t believe him. And they didn’t believe him. And then they launched some rockets at some Americans up at Balad, and we lost a couple. And Trump didn’t hesitate. The next day, he dropped a bomb in that son of a bitch, Qasem Soleimani and blew him to pieces. He blew him to pieces. And I told the president in person the first time we met, I said, “Listen, you may endorse me or not, you may support me or not, but I’ll tell you one thing, you will always have my loyalty because you’re the guy that dropped the bomb on that son of a bitch, Soleimani, and I’ll always have your back for that.”
(01:22:15)
But listen, Biden, Harris, Waltz, whatever you want to call them, they’re selling you out every single day. They are selling out hard working Americans. They are taking your money out of your pocket and giving it to illegal immigrants. They’re taking money out of your pocket and sending billions of dollars of it overseas to other countries while you’re going broke. Our gas prices have doubled and tripled. Inflation’s through the roof. Your life is worse off because the policies of this administration that Jon Tester has voted for every single time are killing America. So this fall, we got to send Donald Trump back to the White House and Jon Tester back to Big Sandy.

Donald Trump (01:22:56):

Great job. Thank you, Tim. Thank you very much, Tim. And I have to say, Tim stands for very strong borders, all the things that we want. He wants strong borders, a very strong military, low taxes, low inflation. But more importantly than anything else, he wants to make America great again. He’s going to do it. We’re going to do it together. Also with us tonight, and I said it before, he is a special man, Senator Steve Daines. You’re lucky to have him. He’s unbelievable, respected by everybody, and it’s an honor to have him as a friend. And he wanted to do this race. He said, “We have to do this race.” We have to take control of the Senate and the House. We’re going to do the House. We’re going to do the Senate. And this is the answer right here. This is the one seat. We do this seat, we’re going to win the Senate. So, so important. And Tim, you’re going to be great. We appreciate it. Thank you very much. Steve, you’re a fantastic man. Kids, you have a great father. Take good care of your father, okay? I mean that. And I alluded to it before. He’s a fantastic guy, a friend of mine. I was one of the earliest to endorse him.
(01:24:08)
Greg Gianforte, your governor he’s been, and respected by everybody. Greg, please, please, thank you. A representative who has been absolutely a fantastic guy. He’s a tough cookie, he is a great fighter, he has every military record you can have. Ryan Zinke. He’s running for Congress again. Good luck, Ryan. You’re going to do great. Thank you. I saw some good poll numbers on you today. That’s very nice. And Ronny Jackson, thank you for that speech you made. That was beautiful. And nobody nobody could do it like you. He knows this guy better than anybody, unfortunately. It was my fault, Ronny. I shouldn’t have done it. I should have said, “Ronny, enjoy your life.” I had to say, “Come on, Ronny.” Then I tell these horrible people back there, “It’s going to be Ronny.” “Oh, boy.” But you know what he did? He came back and he said, “I’m going to run for Congress,” and he ran, and he won. And he won big, big.
(01:25:14)
All right, that’s pretty good. Think of it. You’re a great doctor, become the White House doctor. You’re a great Admiral, you’re doing great. Then you decide, “I’m going to run for Congress.” So you have Congress, you have doctor, you have Admiral. Who the hell has a career like that? That’s pretty good. That beats all of us. Tim, that beats all of us I think. Former acting Attorney General, a friend of mine, Matt Whitaker. Thank you, Matt. Thank you. Great job. Your auditor, oh, that’s good because you have a lot of money here, Troy Downing. Thank you very much. Troy, great job.
(01:25:52)
Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen. Christi, thank you. Good job. You got my endorsement. She’s got my endorsement. They both do. I’m giving you my endorsement now. This way I don’t have to go home and write it out. Is that okay? She has my endorsement, complete and total endorsement. Your great Attorney General, Austin Knutson. Thank you, Austin. Great. Beautiful family. Great family. State party chair, Don Kaltschmidt. Where’s Don? Don, thank you very much. Good job you’re doing. They’re all doing well, right? They’re doing well, Don. You’re doing a great job.
(01:26:34)
RNC chairman, Michael Whatley, very powerful man. Michael, thank you. Thank you, Michael. Thank you, Michael. He’s got one function. We don’t need the votes. He’s going to stop the steal. He’s going to stop the steal. He’s going to make sure that those votes are properly counted. You ever hear things like this? You vote two months early, and you need more time. We want to go back to one-day voting and paper ballots. Very simple, very simple, but he did a great job. He was the head of the Republican Party in North Carolina. When those other states were being robbed and rigged, that guy held so true and he’s going to do it with… He had actually had 603 lawyers working, and other guys just said, “Oh.” You can never take it for granted with these people because they do something very, very well. You know what that is? They cheat. That’s what they is. And in the audience, there’s a man that I gave a pardon to, and I’m very proud. Would you stand up, please? Stand up, you with a beautiful hat on right there. Yeah, stand up. I was very honored. Handsome guy, too. And people were very happy with that. You were happier than anybody, but it was my honor to do it. Thank you very much.
(01:27:52)
And one of our greatest golfers in the history of… I’m a golfer. I love golf. This guy is a major golfer. He’s a major friend of mine, one of the best ever. They knighted him in England or in UK, and he just knew how to win. He could take people and he’d play the best players in the world, and they always folded in front of him. In fact, I think I’m going to bring him into government because we like to get other people to fold. And his nickname is Foldo. He’s really because he makes everyone… But his name is Faldo. Nick Faldo and his beautiful wife, Lindsay. Where is Nick? Where is Nick? That guy can play golf. He’s won six majors and many, many tournaments, and he is one of the greatest ever. So thank you very much. It’s an honor. As a golfer, I don’t know how many… Does anybody play golf? Did anybody ever hear of Nick Faldo? Yeah, they heard. Thank you very much, Nick. It’s an honor. You are a piece of work, I’ll tell you. He’s a tough cookie, too. You talk about a tough cookie, that’s a tough cookie.
(01:28:56)
From the moment we take back the White House from Kamala and Crooked Joe, I believe we’re going to have the four greatest years of the history of our country. Starting on day one, we will end inflation and make America affordable again, to bring down the prices of all goods. We will stop the Biden-Harris war on American energy, and we will drill, baby, drill. Going to bring them way down. That’s what caused the inflation. Their stupid energy policies caused the inflation. I will terminate the Green New Scam, deliver historic regulation cuts, and I will end the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate on day one. You want to have a gasoline-propelled car, or if you want a hybrid, or if you want electric car, it’s great, but you’re going to have your choice. Whatever you want, you’re going to have your choice. That’s the way it should be. We will pass massive tax cuts for workers, and that includes no tax on tips, as I said. We’re going to stop outsourcing, demand a level playing field for the American worker, and turn the United States into the manufacturing superpower of the world. We had it going so beautifully, and then these stupid people came along and ended it. We’re going to be the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we can do it so easy.
(01:30:27)
We’re going to rebuild our cities into beacons of hope and safety and beauty better than they have ever been before. And we will end the migrant crime epidemic, demolish the foreign drug cartels. We are going to demolish those cartels. We’re going to crush gang violence, support our police, and lock up violent offenders behind bars. And we are going to straighten out the crime in our cities. We are going to straighten out the crime in our country. We’re going to get it done fast. We will deport pro-Hamas radicals and make our college campuses safe and patriotic again. You see what’s happened. And before I even arrive at the Oval Office, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled. I will restore peace through strength. That’s what I did. We had no wars. Think of it, no wars. No wars during the Trump administration, Steve. In my next term, we will build a great Iron Dome missile defense shield over our country, a dome like has never been seen before, and it will be entirely made in the USA, including Montana.
(01:31:50)
And unlike Biden who’s destroying Social Security and so many other things, I will not cut 1 cent from Social Security. I will not raise the age which they want to do. They’re destroying Social Security and Medicare by allowing all of these people to come in on the plan. You earned it. You deserve it. We’re going to preserve it for you just the way it is. Thank you. And as you know, I kept my promise for four years, and I will keep my promise very easily again. And seniors, as I said, will not pay taxes on their social security. That’s a big deal.
(01:32:33)
On day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto the lives of our children. We’re not going to do it. I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate. Right? And I will keep men out of women’s sports if that’s okay. See Nick, at least in golf, they got to putt, right? Maybe in golf they have a little chance, but not much. No, I don’t see it. I know you too well. I don’t see them playing against you. But the women golfers are doing very well. But what do you think, Nick? You keep men out of women’s sports, you think that’s okay? I think so. I think so.
(01:33:37)
I will fully uphold the Second Amendment. We will protect innocent life, and we will restore free speech in our country. And I will secure our elections. Our goal will be one-day voting with paper ballots, proof of citizenship, and a thing called voter ID. They don’t want voter ID. Why don’t they want voter ID? We start off with voter ID, and they say, “We don’t want.” You know why? Because they want to cheat. There’s only one reason you don’t want identification. You want to cheat. The radical-left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020. We will not let them rig the presidential election in 2024. Not going to let them rig it. And we want to do this as a landslide. We’re doing great in the polls, and so is Tim.
(01:34:31)
We want to do this as a landslide. And the one way you win, guaranteed, no matter what they do, it’s called we want to win too big to rig. Too big to rig, too big to rig. Gets too big, and they just say, “Oh, we can’t do it. We can’t do it. They got us, too many votes.” We have a lot of votes. So get your friends, get your family, and get out and vote in numbers. And America, I’ll tell you what, like numbers that you’ve never seen before. I think that’s going to happen. I think we’re going to have the greatest election victory in the history of our country. And to help ensure election integrity, go to protectthevote.com, protectthevote.com.
(01:35:14)
So in conclusion, from Bigfork to Billings, from Glendive to Great Falls, and from Big Sky to right here in Bozeman, this state was built by some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk the face of the earth. Montana is the land of cowboys and cattle hands, ranchers and farmers, frontiersmen and soldiers, adventurers and pioneers who charged into the wilderness, scaled the Rockies, trekked through the ice and snow, and carved out a life in one of the most beautiful places in all of God’s creation. It’s true. I saw them. So true, it’s so true. All of that driving today. There’s no place more beautiful than this. Together, they built this state. They helped make America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world.
(01:36:09)
But now we are a nation in decline. We’re a failing nation. We are a nation that has lost its confidence, lost its willpower, and lost its strength. We are a nation that has quite simply lost its way, but we are not going to allow this horror to continue. Less than four years ago, we were a great nation, and we will soon be a great nation again. It’s going to go quickly. With our leadership, every disaster Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have created can be fixed, and it can be fixed quickly. It’s going to have to be fixed quickly. We don’t have time. Every problem can be solved and every wrong can be rectified. By this time next year, America’s borders will be strong, sealed, and secure, promise. Inflation will be in full retreat. Our economy will be roaring back. Optimism will be surging. The American dream, which you never hear about anymore, will be thriving again. For citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed, law and justice will reign all throughout our land. Freedom will be restored. The flame of liberty will be burning bright. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, the worst administration in the history of our country, will be a fading memory of the past.
(01:37:45)
And our great silent majority, including the once-forgotten men and women of our country, will be the one shaping America’s magnificent future when I am the 47th President of the United States because we are all Americans. And together, we will show November 5th to be the most important day in the history of America. November 5th, election day and that period will be the most important day and period in the history of our country. Our country will be greater than ever before. You have to remember November 5th, and mark it down, the most important day in history because we are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America powerful again, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, we will make America free again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Montana. Thank you. Vote for Tim. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. God bless you all. Thank you.","Montana","2024-08-12",8,5,2,5,1,0,1,1,2,0

Why don’t we liberate these United States, the ones who need it worst? Let the of world help us for a change, and let’s rebuild America first. Our highways and bridges are falling apart, who’s blessed and who has been cursed? There’s things to be done all over the world, but let’s rebuild America first.

JD Vance (00:54):

Wow. Thank you. All right, my friends. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Well, it is great to be in Atlanta. Hello, Georgia. In 93 days, we’re going to take back our country and elect Donald J. Trump once again. It’s going to start right here in Georgia. Now let’s recap the last month in political history. We have to remember, just over a month ago, President Trump wiped the floor with Joe Biden on that debate stage, exposing a massive cover-up of the President’s mental incapacity. He saved America from four more years of the disaster of Joe Biden. And during that same time, Donald Trump accepted our own party’s nomination with overwhelming support. We held the most successful convention in history. He took a bullet for this country and didn’t miss a single day of work.
(02:14)
Now he did that in one month. Just imagine what he’s going to do with four more years. Ain’t that right? Now, after covering up Joe Biden’s incompetence for the last three and a half years, our friends in the media are at it again. This time they’re gaslighting us on Kamala Harris’s radical record. They want to portray her as some kind of sensible moderate, despite all evidence to the contrary. Now, this is the same media that told us, remember my friends for three and a half years that Joe Biden, who couldn’t complete a sentence was Albert Einstein. And now they want to tell us that Kamala Harris is Abraham Lincoln.
(03:05)
But anybody who is too blind to see Biden’s incompetence, or let’s be honest, too dishonest to admit it, doesn’t deserve to be commander in chief. Kamala Harris is not getting a promotion to the Presidency of the United States. Now, the Democrat party bosses would like to install her as their new nominee and as the next President. But remember, she has not received a single vote for President. Let’s actually give Democrat primary voters some credit, because in their primary in 2020, Kamala Harris was so unpopular she didn’t even make it to the first vote being cast. She wasn’t in the top three in her home state of California. And the reason is Democrat voters know what every American agrees with. America is never going to elect a San Francisco liberal who’s so far outside the mainstream, we’re not going to elect Kamala Harris as President.
(04:20)
Now let us count the ways of the disastrous policies of Kamala Harris. 500,000 kids. I was at the border just a couple of days ago. 500,000 kids had been trafficked by the drug cartels because of her policy. She was the border czar. The media lies to you, but she was. Hard-working Americans cannot afford groceries because of her policies. Gas and energy are through the roof because of her policies. Housing prices are out of control because of her policies. You cannot let in 20 million illegal aliens to compete with Americans for scarce housing and then raise interest rates, which is exactly what Kamala Harris has done. And people right here in Georgia and all across the country have suffered because of it. Now the media calls her a moderate, but there’s nothing the fake news loves more than a fact check. So let’s do a fact check. Kamala Harris was the most liberal United States Center during her entire time in public service.
(05:25)
As America’s border czar, Kamala Harris unleashed the worst border crisis in American history. 10 million illegal aliens have invaded this country. That’s what they say. That’s the official number. It’s probably more than that. Biden-Harris, on day one, they suspended deportations. They stopped building the border wall. I saw it just a couple of days ago. It’s sitting there on the ground ready to be finished, but Kamala Harris won’t let him. They reinstated catch and release. Then they proposed amnesty for millions of illegal aliens. Kamala Harris turned border patrol into a travel agency for the worst criminals and terrorists all over the world. Now we have a different message, President Trump and I do. If you’re in this country illegally, start packing your bags, you go home in six months. But we’re not done yet. The border isn’t the only thing Kamala Harris has wrecked during her time in office. In 2021, she was the tie-breaking vote on $2 trillion of reckless spending that juiced this inflation crisis and sent a lot of money to China.
(07:09)
Well, I don’t think we should send money to China. I think we ought to keep it right here at home. Remember the Inflation Reduction Act, which was really the inflation is a disaster act, she cast the deciding vote, triggered the worst affordability crisis in generations. And at the same time, she said that high gas prices were, “the price to pay for democracy.” A woman who’s never earned a vote for President of the United States, that’s the price for democracy. That’s not the price for democracy, my friends. It’s the price we paid for her failed leadership. Now, Harris wants to ban fracking, ban offshore drilling, take away your gas cars. And by the way, I think in America, you ought to be able to drive whatever the hell you want to, because this is America and we believe in freedom.
(08:15)
She wants to take away your gas stoves, even wants to take away your ability to eat red meat. That’s how out there she is. That’s real. The fake news will fact check it. They’ll fact check it. True. She actually said that. In other words, she thinks that she’s better than us. She thinks she’s better than you. She thinks she’s smarter than you. She thinks you need to be told how to live your life. But this November, let’s tell the Washington elites, let’s tell Kamala Harris, mind your own damn business. We’re electing Donald J. Trump, President of the United States. Now. Now, every time, every time the Democrats attack us and attack our movement, they can’t help but tell on themselves. They reveal how much they hate the American people. Now remember this. Remember Barack Obama said, we cling to God and guns. Remember that? Hillary Clinton called us deplorables. And now Kamala Harris says we’re weird. Well, Kamala, I’m glad you brought that up. Let’s talk about some things that are weird. We think it’s weird that Democrats want to put sexually explicit books in toddlers libraries. We think it’s weird that the far left wants to allow biological males to beat the living crap out of women in boxing. We think it’s weird for a Presidential candidate to bail convicted rapists and murderers out prison, and that’s what Kamala Harris did. And I think it’s especially weird when Kamala Harris comes to Atlanta, I believe came here to this arena, Kamala Harris comes to Atlanta and talks with a fake southern accent, even though she grew up in Canada. You can’t make it up. That’s pretty weird. Go watch the clip. She sounded like a southern belle. Even though she grew up in Vancouver, it doesn’t make any sense. But on November 5th, she can go back to using her San Francisco accent, because we’re going to send her packing and we’re going to reelect Donald J. Trump, President of the United States. Now, we can handle the made-up attacks by Democrats and by the media, because we’re used to it by now. But here’s something I can’t stomach about Kamala Harris. It’s when she has the nerve to question our loyalty to this country. And she does. Well, here’s what President Trump and I believe about loyalty. Loyalty to this country is closing our border, not opening it up. Loyalty is making life more affordable, not causing inflation, because you can’t stop sending money like a drunken sailor. Loyalty is safeguarding Medicare for American citizens, not bankrupting it by sending it to illegal aliens, which is what she wants to do. Loyalty is protecting Lake and Riley, not allowing an illegal immigrant to take her life. Loyalty is serving in the United States Marine Corps, something I’m proud to have done. Loyalty is taking a bullet for this country, something Donald J. Trump did. Kamala Harris, if you want to see the face of disloyalty, look in the damn mirror.
(13:24)
Now, for decades we’ve gotten used to it. Politicians in Washington have sold out this country. We got to remember, when the multinational corporations and the lobbyists called their offices, a lot of them traded American jobs for campaign cash. Now, they never admit that of course, they’d brag about trade deals and they’d promise cheap products. They called it globalization. And that’s what it was. Sending American jobs to some other part of the globe, instead of keeping them right here at home. And my friends, if it’s up to Kamala Harris, it’s going to keep on happening. Let’s remember her record. She voted to preserve NAFTA, the very trade deal that sent American jobs to Mexico and turned American dreams into nightmares.
(14:12)
Now she’s asking us for a promotion and I think it’s time to say to Kamala Harris, “You’re fired.” The American dream, the American dream is dying under Kamala Harris, but we’re going to save it. We’re going to save it for every American regardless of color or creed. And we’re going to do it when we re-elect Donald J. Trump, President of the United States. That’s why we got to do it. You know, President Trump knows a few things that the Washington politicians forgot. He knows that a million cheap plastic toys from China is not worth a single American manufacturing job.
(15:05)
We’re going to rebuild American manufacturing. We’re going to rebuild the factories, we’re going to rebuild the American dream and we’re going to stamp more products made in the USA. It’s a beautiful thing and that’s what we’re going to do. Now, I’ve seen the consequences of electing failed politicians like Kamala Harris. I’ve seen it in my own hometown, because more often than not, it’s the people the Bible calls the least of these that suffer the most when Kamala Harris doesn’t do her job. They like to say they’re for the little guy, but it’s the little guy who hurts the most when Kamala Harris fails. Now a lot of my story, you know how I grew up. I was raised by a strong woman, a Christian grandmother who loved the Lord, but also loved the F-word, ladies and gentlemen. She was a study in contrast. I think there are a few out here just like it.
(16:05)
Now people ask me, “How is it that you were able to grow up in a poor family, grow up in a family that was struggling, had a lot of chaos and a lot of trouble?”
(16:14)
And the answer is because one, this is the greatest country in the world and the American dream is still possible. The second answer is because I had a mamaw who was tough as nails and she kept me on the right path. Now, can tell you a lot of stories. I can tell you a lot of stories. Well, one of my favorite mamaw stories is when I enlisted in the US Marine Corps, she was very proud of me, of course, but it was a time of war, and mamaw was not happy that a recruiter had persuaded me to enlist the Marines. So I remember, he came over to our house and started to walk up the steps to her porch, and she said, “Look, if you step one more foot on my porch, I’m going to blow that thing off.” And she had 19 handguns at home, so that was not an idle threat.
(17:23)
But that strength and that discipline allowed me to achieve my dreams and things worked out for me, because we love our country, it’s a great country, and because there are women like mamaw all over this country, making sure kids are able to achieve their dreams. Thank you. But let’s be honest, there were some tough times too. And this goes to the point about Kamala Harris’s failures. I remember the reason mamaw raised me, is because my mom struggled with addiction for a big chunk of my early life. And I’m proud to say that she has been clean and sober for almost 10 years now. I’m so proud of my mom. Thank you. And for all those struggling with this terrible problem of addiction, no, there is hope and there is recovery. It’s worth it. You got to keep fighting for it, but we support you and we support your dreams for second chances.
(18:27)
But wasn’t always that good. Didn’t always think that I would get a second chance with my mom. I remember being a kid waiting at the bedside of my mom, angry that she had taken something she shouldn’t have taken. And just praying to God, even though I was so mad, praying to God, “Please Jesus, just let her wake up. Don’t let this thing be the thing that took her life.” And the unfortunate truth, my friends, is that the poison that Kamala Harris has let into this country means there are a lot of kids like me who are not going to have those prayers answered. We’re going to remember who we’re fighting for. And it’s the kids at the side of those bedside tables begging God for their parents to wake up. We’re going to make sure that happens. We’re going to fight for the people who are struggling in this country.
(19:24)
And the contrast, the contrast between an America led by Kamala Harris and an America led by President Trump. It couldn’t be more clear. Remember, President Trump’s vision was closed borders and open factories. Kamala Harris’s vision is the exact opposite, open borders and closed factories. Kamala Harris, she wants bigger government that can tell you what to do. And she also wants smaller bank accounts, which I think a lot of us have seen. But Donald Trump, by contrast, delivered record paychecks and the strongest border in history. What an amazing record of accomplishment. Kamala Harris wants to ban fracking and buy energy from every tin pot dictator all over the world. Donald Trump wants to drill, baby, drill. Let’s get it from our own workers and our own territory. Kamala Harris wants to raise your taxes and she wants to make it easier for companies to ship jobs to Mexico and China. Donald Trump wants to lower taxes for hardworking families.
(20:39)
In fact, he already did it. And we want to reward companies that hire American and buy American. It’s all about protecting the workers of this country. Kamala Harris wants to defund the police and let violent criminals out of jail. Donald Trump wants to lock up the bad guys and back the blue, and he did it for four years. He’s going to do it again. So I want to send a message out there to those who are struggling, those who are trying to make ends meet. If you’re scraping by instead of thriving, I know what that feels like. I know what it’s like to choose between paying off the credit card or buying groceries. I know what it’s like to watch families fall apart under financial stress. I know what it’s like to worry that a parent will never kick that habit, and I know what it’s like to worry that that habit is going to eventually claim their lives. But I also know that our national motto is in God we trust, and God tells us not to despair, but to hope. Hope. And while the media likes to lie about this movement and this party, this movement of ours is about a simple idea. We love this country enough that we will never give up hope and we will never stop fighting for a better future for everybody, whether they vote for us or not. If you’re an American citizen, we love you and we’re going to fight for you. Now, we know that in this election, the best way to give our people hope for the future is to re-elect the guy who already did it and did it very well. Donald J. Trump, the once and future President of the United States.
(22:44)
In just a few months, I believe this state of Georgia is going to lead a great American restoration, a restoration of safety, of prosperity, and yes, of hope. We’re going to secure our borders. We’re going to kick out the drugs and the illegal immigrants. We’re going to rebuild American manufacturing. We’re going to bring jobs back to this country and we are going to buy American, for American, for our people. It’s going to start in Georgia. God bless you all. Thank you so much for having me. I’m going to be your next Vice President and we are going to win Georgia, and win this country. I love you all. Thank you so much for having me.

Music (23:41):

Why don’t we liberate these United States, we’re the ones who need it worst. Let the rest of the world help us for change, and let’s rebuild America first. Our highways and bridges are falling apart, who’s blessed and who has been cursed? There’s things to be done all over the world, but let’s rebuild America first.
(24:35)
Who’s on the hill and who’s watching the valley? Who’s in charge of it all? God bless the army and God bless our liberty, dad gum the rest of it all. Yeah, the men in position are backing away. Freedom is stuck in reverse. Let’s get out of Iraq, get back on the track, and let’s rebuild America first.
(25:17)
Once more. Why don’t we liberate these United States? We’re the ones who need it the most. You think I’m blowing smoke? Boys, it ain’t no joke. I make 20 trips a year from coast to coast.

Speaker 1 (26:06):

Joe Biden made Kamala Harris border czar to fix immigration. First, she ignored it.

Speaker 2 (26:11):

Do you have any plans to visit the border?

Kamala Harris (26:15):

At some point.

Speaker 1 (26:16):

Then she just lied.

Kamala Harris (26:17):

The border is secure.

Speaker 1 (26:19):

10 million illegal immigrants. Migrant crime out of control. Fentanyl kills thousands.

Kamala Harris (26:24):

We have a secure border.

Speaker 1 (26:29):

Kamala Harris. Failed, weak, dangerously liberal.

Music (26:33):

Well it’s been building up inside of me for, oh, I don’t know how long. I don’t know why, but I keep thinking something’s bound to go wrong. But she looks in my eyes and makes me realize, and she says, “Don’t worry, baby. Don’t worry, baby. Don’t worry, baby. Everything will turn out all right. Don’t worry, baby. Don’t worry, baby. Don’t worry, baby.
(26:41)
I guess I should have kept my mouth shut when I started to brag about my car, but I can’t back down now because I pushed the other guys too far. She makes me come alive, and makes me want to drive when she says, “Don’t worry, baby. Don’t worry, baby. Don’t worry, baby. Everything will turn out all right. Don’t worry, baby. Don’t worry, baby. Don’t worry, baby.”
(26:41)
She told me, “Baby, when you race today just take along my love with you. And if you knew how much I loved you, baby, nothing could go wrong with you.”
(26:41)
Oh, what she does to me when she makes love to me, and she says, “Don’t worry, baby. Don’t worry, baby. Don’t worry, baby. Everything will turn out all right. Don’t worry, baby. Don’t worry, baby. Don’t worry, baby.”
(26:41)
Clean shirt, new shoes, and I don’t know where I’m going to. Silk suit, black tie, and I don’t need a reason why. They coming running just as fast as they can, because every girl’s crazy about a sharp dressed man.
(26:41)
Gold watch, diamond ring, I ain’t missing not a single thing. Cufflinks, stick pin, when I step out I’m going to do you in. They come running just as fast as they can, because every girl’s crazy about a sharp dressed man.

Music (31:00):

Top coat, top hat.
(31:00)
But I don’t worry ’cause my wallet’s fat.
(31:00)
Black shades, white gloves.
(31:00)
Lookin’ sharp, I’m lookin’ for love.
(31:00)
They come runnin’ just as fast as they can.
(31:00)
‘Cause every girl crazy ’bout a sharp-dressed man.
(31:00)
Come here, sugar.
(31:00)
Right to me.
(31:00)
You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain.
(31:00)
Too much love drives a man insane.
(31:00)
You broke my will, but what a thrill.
(31:00)
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire.
(31:00)
I laughed at love ’cause I thought it was funny.
(31:00)
You came along and you moved me, honey.
(31:00)
Whoo.
(31:00)
I’ve changed my mind, this love is fine.
(31:00)
[inaudible 00:34:19].
(31:00)
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire.
(31:00)
Now, kiss me, baby.
(31:00)
Wooh, it feels good.
(31:00)
Hold me, baby.
(31:00)
Girl, just let me love you like a lover should.
(31:00)
You’re fine, so kind.
(31:00)
I’m gonna tell this world that you’re mine, mine, mine, mine.
(31:00)
I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs.
(31:00)
I’m real nervous, but it sure is fun.
(31:00)
Come on, baby, you’re drivin’ me crazy.
(31:00)
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire.

Audio (35:40):

Mr. Freed, Jerry Lee Lewis can blow Chuck Berry right off of that stage.
(35:45)
Why do I have to go on before him?
(35:47)
Because he’s at six number one hits and you’ve had only two in the top 10.
(35:50)
Well, who’s got the number one record right now?
(35:54)
You.
(35:54)
My point exactly.
(35:55)
He should go on on before me.
(35:58)
Can’t. It’s in his contract that he closes the show.
(36:01)
Okay, Captain. If that’s the way you want it.

Music (36:29):

Well kiss me, baby.
(36:29)
Ooh, it feels good.
(36:29)
Hold me, baby.
(36:29)
I want to love you like a lover should.
(36:29)
You’re fine, so kind.
(36:29)
I got to tell this world that you’re mine, mine, mine, mine.
(36:29)
I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs.
(36:29)
I’m real nervous, ’cause it sure is fun.
(36:29)
Come on, baby, drive me crazy.
(36:29)
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire.
(37:53)
I say goodness gracious, great balls of fire.

Audio (38:02):

Hey.
(38:02)
[inaudible 00:37:54] killer? You’re considered the most liberal United States Senator.
(38:05)
We’re not going to treat people who are undocumented and cross the border as criminal. Abolish ICE.
(38:10)
Yeah, is that a position that you agree with?
(38:13)
We need to probably think about starting from scratch.
(38:15)
Say it loud. Say it clear. Everyone is welcome here.
(38:18)
Raise your hand if you think it should be a civil offense rather than a crime to cross the border.
(38:23)
Raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.
(38:28)
You support giving universal healthcare, Medicare for All, to people who are in this country illegally?
(38:33)
I am opposed to any policy that would deny, in our country, any human being, from access to public health, period.
(38:41)
You support the Medicare for All bill. I believe it will totally eliminate private insurance. For people out there who like their insurance, they don’t get to keep it?
(38:49)
Let’s eliminate all of that.
(38:50)
Boston Marathon bomber, on death row. People who are convicted of sexual assault. They should be able to vote?
(38:55)
I think we should have that conversation.
(38:57)
As President of the United States, I am prepared to pass a Green New Deal.
(39:01)
Would you ban offshore drilling?
(39:02)
Yes.
(39:03)
What is the solution for voters who have jobs and interests in the fossil fuel industry?
(39:09)
Transition into the jobs of the future.
(39:12)
Would you support changing the dietary guidelines? Reduce red meat, specifically?
(39:16)
Yes. I would.
(39:17)
We have to have a buyback program and I support a mandatory buyback program.

Music (44:12):

Ever since I was a young boy.
(44:12)
I’ve played the silver ball.
(44:12)
From Soho down to Brighton.
(44:12)
I must have played ’em all.
(44:12)
But I ain’t seen nothing like him.
(44:12)
In any amusement hall.
(44:12)
That deaf, dumb and blind kid.
(44:12)
Sure plays a mean pinball.
(44:12)
He stands like a statue.
(44:12)
Becomes part of the machine.
(44:12)
Feeling all the bumpers.
(44:12)
Always playing clean.
(44:12)
He plays by intuition.
(44:12)
The digit counters fall.
(44:12)
That deaf, dumb and blind kid.
(44:12)
Sure plays a mean pinball.
(44:12)
He’s a pinball wizard.
(44:12)
There has got to be a twist.
(44:12)
A pinball wizard got such a supple wrist.
(44:12)
How do you think he does it?
(44:12)
I don’t know.
(44:12)
What makes him so good?
(44:12)
Well, he ain’t got no distractions.
(44:12)
Can’t hear no buzzers and bells.
(44:12)
Don’t see lights a-flashin’.
(44:12)
He plays by sense of smell.
(44:12)
Always has a replay.
(44:12)
Never tilts at all.
(44:12)
That deaf, dumb and blind kid.
(44:12)
Sure plays a mean pinball.
(44:12)
You can’t beat him now.
(44:12)
I’ve always been the champ.
(44:12)
I know every trick.
(44:12)
No freak’s gonna beat my hand.
(44:12)
On my usual table, he can beat the best.
(44:12)
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest.
(44:12)
He’s got crazy flipper fingers.
(44:12)
I’ve never seen him fall.
(44:12)
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid.
(44:12)
Sure plays a mean pinball.
(44:12)
He’s a pinball wizard.
(44:12)
There has to be a twist.
(44:12)
A pinball wizard’s got such a supple wrist.
(44:12)
He’s a pinball wizard.
(44:12)
He scores a trillion more.
(44:12)
A pinball wizard, the world’s new pinball lord.
(44:12)
He’s scoring more.
(44:12)
He’s scoring more.
(44:12)
I thought I was the Bally table king.
(44:12)
But I just handed my pinball crown to him.
(44:12)
To him.
(44:12)
To him.
(44:12)
This is a man’s world.
(44:12)
This is a man’s world. But it wouldn’t be nothing, nothing, nothing, without a woman or a girl.
(45:17)
You see, man made the cars.
(45:22)
To take us over the road.
(45:23)
Man made the train.
(45:23)
To carry the heavy load.
(45:23)
Man made the electric lighting.
(45:23)
To take us out of the dark.
(45:23)
And man made the boat for the water.
(45:23)
Like my Bible said Noah made the ark.
(45:23)
This is a man’s world.
(45:23)
But it wouldn’t be nothing, nothing, nothing, without a woman or a girl.
(45:23)
[foreign language 00:46:23]
(45:23)
Man thinks about our little bitty baby girls.
(45:23)
And our baby boys.
(45:23)
Man make them happy.
(45:23)
‘Cause man make them toys.
(45:23)
And after man make everything he can.
(45:23)
Man make little pesos, dollars, rubles.
(45:23)
To buy from every good woman, every man.
(47:38)
It is a man’s world.
(47:38)
[foreign language 00:47:45]
(47:38)
He lost.
(47:38)
Man’s world.
(47:38)
In the wilderness.
(47:38)
It’s a man’s world.
(47:38)
He lost.
(47:38)
[foreign language 00:48:13]
(47:38)
[inaudible 00:48:16].
(47:38)
This is a man’s world.
(47:38)
Mama, just killed a man.
(47:38)
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he’s dead.
(47:38)
Mama, life had just begun.
(47:38)
But now I’ve gone and thrown it all away.
(49:00)
Mama, ooh, didn’t mean to make you cry.
(49:00)
If I’m not back again this time tomorrow.
(49:17)
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.
(49:17)
Too late, my time has come.
(49:17)
Sends shivers down my spine, body’s aching all the time.
(49:18)
Goodbye, everybody, I’ve got to go.
(49:18)
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.
(49:36)
Mama, ooh, I don’t wanna die.
(49:36)
I sometimes wish I’d never been born at all. I’ve been sellin’ my soul, workin’ all day.
(51:47)
Overtime hours for bullshit pay.
(51:50)
So I can sit out here and waste my life away.
(51:55)
Drag back home and drown my troubles away.
(51:58)
It’s a damn shame what the world’s gotten to.
(52:02)
For people like me and people like you.
(52:06)
Wish I could just wake up and it not be true.
(52:10)
But it is, oh, it is.
(52:13)
Livin’ in the new world.
(52:18)
With an old soul.
(52:18)
These rich men north of Richmond.
(52:24)
Lord knows they all just wanna have total control. Wanna know what you think.
(52:35)
Wanna know what you do.
(52:35)
And they don’t think you know.
(52:35)
But I know that you do.
(52:36)
‘Cause your dollar ain’t shit.
(52:38)
And it’s taxed to no end.
(52:39)
‘Cause of rich men north of Richmond.
(52:39)
I wish politicians would look out for miners.
(52:56)
And not just minors on an island somewhere. Lord, we got folks in the street, ain’t got nothin’ to eat.
(53:05)
And the obese milking welfare.
(53:08)
Well, God, if you’re 5’3″ and you’re 300 pounds.
(53:13)
Taxes ought not to pay for your bags of Fudge Rounds.
(53:16)
Young men are puttin’ themselves six feet in the ground.
(53:20)
‘Cause all this damn country does is keep on kickin’ them down.
(53:26)
Lord, It’s a damn shame what the world’s gotten to. For people like me and people like you.
(53:34)
Wish I could just wake up and it not be true.
(53:38)
But it is, oh, it is.
(53:41)
Living’ in the new world.
(53:46)
With an old soul.
(53:46)
These rich men north of Richmond.
(53:52)
Lord knows they all just wanna have total control.
(53:59)
Wanna know what you think.
(54:00)
Wanna know what you do.
(54:00)
And they don’t think you know.
(54:03)
But I know that you do.
(54:05)
‘Cause your dollar ain’t shit.
(54:07)
And it’s taxed to no end.
(54:09)
‘Cause of rich men north of Richmond. I’ve been sellin’ my soul, workin’ all day.
(54:35)
Overtime hours for bullshit pay.
(54:53)
I can see what’s happening.
(54:54)
What?
(54:55)
And they don’t have a clue.
(54:57)
Who?
(54:58)
They’ll fall in love.
(54:58)
And here’s the bottom line.
(55:01)
Our trio’s down to two.
(55:03)
Oh.
(55:03)
The sweet caress of twilight.
(55:03)
There’s magic everywhere.
(55:11)
And with all this romantic atmosphere.
(55:17)
Disaster’s in the air.
(55:41)
Can you feel the love tonight?
(55:41)
The peace the evening brings.
(55:41)
The world for once in perfect harmony.
(55:41)
With all its living things.
(55:50)
So many things to tell her.
(55:54)
But how to make her see.
(55:57)
The truth about my past?
(55:59)
Impossible! She’d turn away from me.
(56:03)
He’s holding back, he’s hiding.
(56:07)
But what, I can’t decide.
(56:09)
Why won’t he be the king I know he is?
(56:12)
The king I see inside?
(56:12)
Can you feel the love tonight?
(56:12)
The peace the evening brings. The world for once in perfect harmony.
(56:43)
With all its living things.
(56:48)
Can you feel the love tonight?
(56:48)
You needn’t look too far.
(56:48)
Stealing through the night’s uncertainties.
(56:48)
Love is where they are.
(56:48)
And if he falls in love tonight.
(56:48)
Yeah!
(56:48)
And I’ve set up and torn down this stage with my own two hands.
(56:48)
We’ve traveled this land packed tight in minivans.
(56:48)
And all this for the fans, girls, money, and fame.
(57:43)
I play their game, and then they scream my name.
(57:44)
I will show no shame.
(57:44)
I live and die for this.
(57:44)
And if I come off soft, then chew on this.
(57:46)
Are you scared?
(57:49)
Devil without a cause, and I’m back.
(57:51)
With the beaver hats and Ben Davis slacks.
(57:54)
30-pack of Stroh’s, 30-pack of hoes.
(57:57)
No Rogaine in the propane flows.
(57:59)
The chosen one, I’m the living proof.
(58:02)
With the gift of gab from the city of truth.
(58:05)
I jabbed and stabbed and knocked critics back.
(58:07)
And I did not stutter when I said that.
(58:07)
I’m goin’ platinum.
(58:07)
Sellin’ rhymes.
(58:07)
I went platinum.
(58:07)
Seven times.
(58:07)
And still they ill, they wanna see us fry.
(58:18)
I guess because of only God knows why, why, why, why.
(58:26)
They call me cowboy.
(58:26)

Never gayed away, I don’t play with ass.

But watch me rock with Liberace flash.

Full sack to share, bringin’ flash and glare.

Gloria, you’re always on the run now.
(01:04:07)
Running after somebody, you gotta get him somehow.
(01:04:07)
I think you’ve got to slow down before you start to blow it.
(01:04:07)
I think you’re headed for a breakdown, so be careful not to show it.

You really don’t remember, was it something that he said?

(01:04:08)
Will you meet him on the main line, or will you catch him on the rebound?
(01:04:08)
Will you marry for the money, take a lover in the afternoon?
(01:04:25)
Feel your innocence slipping away, don’t believe it’s comin’ back soon.
(01:04:40)
And you really don’t remember, was it something that he said?

I said, young man, what do you wanna be?
(01:18:28)
I said, young man, you can make real your dreams.
(01:19:21)
But you got to know this one thing.
(01:19:21)
No man does it all by himself.
(01:19:21)
I said, young man, put your pride on the shelf.
(01:19:21)
And just go there to the YMCA.
(01:19:21)

Young man, I was once in your shoes.
(01:20:17)
I said, I was down and out with the blues.
(01:20:21)
I felt no man cared if I was alive.
(01:20:21)
I felt the whole world was so jive.
(01:20:25)
That’s when someone came up to me.
(01:20:25)
And said, “Young man, take a walk up the street.”
(01:20:36)
“There’s a place there called the YMCA.”
(01:20:36)
“They can start you back on your way.”

YMCA. It’s…

Dana White (01:20:36):

It’s my honor to introduce the 45th and soon to be 47th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.

Donald Trump (01:21:48):

November 5th is going to be the most important day in the history of our country. And we will bring our country back together, bigger, better, bolder, brighter, happier, stronger, freer, greater, and more united than ever before. And together, we will win, win, win.

Ronny Jackson (01:22:08):

I have never, ever been prouder of President Trump, of my president, than when he stood up with blood all over his face-

Audience (01:22:14):

Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

Ronny Jackson (01:22:14):

And he raised his fist in defiance and he shook his fist.

Donald Trump (01:22:17):

They’re not coming after me, they’re coming after you, and I just happen to be standing in their way, and I will never be moving.

Donald Trump, Jr. (01:22:24):

He’s not meant to be stopped. He’s meant to help fix this country.

Donald Trump (01:22:27):

On November 5th, 2024, we will take back our country, and we will make America great again.

Speaker 3 (01:22:41):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next vice president of the United States, Senator J. D. Vance.

Music (01:23:00):

Why don’t we liberate these United States?
(01:23:04)
We’re the ones who need it worst.
(01:23:04)
Let the rest of the world help us for change.
(01:23:13)
And let’s rebuild America first.
(01:23:14)
Our highways and bridges are falling apart.
(01:23:14)
Who’s blessed and who has been…

JD Vance (01:23:24):

It’s good to see you all again. Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready to hear from the next president of the United States?

Audience (01:23:35):

Yes!

JD Vance (01:23:35):

That wasn’t quite loud enough. Are you ready to hear from the next president of the United States?

Audience (01:23:45):

Yes!

JD Vance (01:23:45):

Remember, eight years ago, Donald Trump had everything: fame, fortune, family, friends. He gave up the easy life so that we could get our country back. He traded everything he had for unjust persecution, for slander and scorn from the fake news, all for this country, for you and me. They couldn’t beat him politically, so they tried to bankrupt him. They failed at that, so they tried to impeach him. They failed at that, so they tried to put him in prison. They even tried to kill him. But as sure as the American flag still waves in our beautiful sky, Donald Trump still stands ready to fight, ready to win, and ready to make America great again. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the once and future president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.

Music (01:25:13):

And I’m proud to be an American.

Donald Trump (01:27:25):

Thank you very much to the next vice president of the United States, J. D. Vance. He’s doing a great job. They go after J. D. You know why? He’s for the worker. He’s for people that get out and they want to work, work, work.

Audience (01:27:43):

[inaudible 01:27:43].

Donald Trump (01:27:44):

And frankly, they are people that have been taken advantage of, and he doesn’t like it. And he’s done great. He’s done great. He’s been everything we could have expected and much more. So J. D., thank you very much, I appreciate it.
(01:27:57)
And thank you to Atlanta. I’m thrilled to be back in the great state of Georgia, I love Georgia. With thousands of proud, hard-working American patriots. Crazy Kamala, ultra-left, you know that, she was here a week ago, lots of empty seats. But the crowd she got was because she had entertainers, and it all started to unfold when they started to leave about 10 minutes into the speech. It was very boring. I don’t need entertainers, I fill the stadium because I’m making America great again. That’s our entertainment. That’s our entertainment, making America great again.
(01:28:45)
And I have to tell you, we have thousands of people outside. And the state was terrific, and the fire marshal, I will say, could not have been better. Thank you to the fire marshal. But the school administration stopped us from getting another 500, 600, even 1,000 people in. Thousands of people were told no, and that was okay, but we could have fit another 600 people. So, I don’t know anything about this school. I don’t know anything about this school, but they could have allowed more people. You got people standing outside, just look at all the people outside. They could have come in. They could have come in. So, we’re not happy. Hello, out there. And then they actually pushed the people very far away from the building, where we have beautiful cameras set up for the overflow crowds. The administration of the school. So, I’m not sure if I’m going to be sending anybody to this school. I’m not happy about it. If they’re going to stand in the way of admitting people to our rally, just imagine what they’re going to do on election day. We’re not going to let that happen.
(01:30:04)
94 days from now, we’re going to win the great state of Georgia in an epic landslide, and we’re going to defeat crazy Kamala. Kamala. You know, there’s about 19 different ways of saying it. She only likes three. Biden never even came close. Hamala, he goes, Hamala. No, it’s Kamala. We’re going to evict this radical, incompetent administration from the White House. They’re destroying our country. We’re going to save our country. We’re going to save our country.
(01:30:47)
Yesterday, it was announced that unemployment is surging, with 350,000 Americans joining the unemployment rolls just last month. Tell you what, we could end up in a depression. We could end up in World War III and a depression, how about that? Could happen, too. Under Harris-Biden policies, we now have the highest unemployment rate in three years. Just came out yesterday, even I was surprised. Those numbers were terrible. If Harris wins this election, you will quickly have a Kamala economic crash. You’re going to have a crash. You could also have a crash like in 1929, more specifically, because that’s where we’re headed. When we win, you will rapidly see a brand new Trump economic boom. It’s going to be booming like it was four years ago.
(01:31:42)
With your vote, inflation will stop, the illegal aliens will be turned back. They’re not coming in, we got to stop them. Did you see what she’s now saying? “Oh, we have a very good border.” Oh, great. They had the worst border in the history of the world. It’s all misinformation, that’s all they’re good at. That and cheating on elections, they’re very good at that. The cartels will be crushed, crime will plummet, incomes will soar, the wars will end, and the American dream will come roaring back bigger, better, and stronger than ever before, right? Yes? Thank you.
(01:32:27)
But with four more years of Kamala the California socialist, you know she destroyed San Francisco? Then she destroyed the whole state. Look at what’s going on in California, with your family and our country, it’ll never recover. If you have any more time with these people… I’m worried about the next three months, if you think about it. These people are grossly incompetent. You’ll end up in World War III, I’ll tell you. And I hope I’m not right about that. Do you ever see the hats? “Trump is right about everything”. I don’t want

Donald Trump (01:33:00):

I’ll be right about that. Her policies of open borders and double-digit inflation, inflation like we’ve never seen before. It’s destroying middle-income families, working families, all families, will demolish your life savings. 40 or 50 million illegal aliens will invade our country during the next four years if they’re in. 40 or 50 million. Medicare and Social Security, she said she wants to put everybody on healthcare. That’s wonderful. It’s all wonderful. First of all, they shouldn’t be told to come here. Many of them were fine where they were, but no country can sustain this. Social security will buckle and collapse. The suburbs will be overrun with violent crime and savage foreign gangs. That’s what they’re doing. They’re sending all their gangs into the United States, right? Look, there’s Front Row Joes didn’t get into the front row. What happened to you? Oh, what happened? Thank you. We have Front row Joes, they’ve been to 229 rallies. And then look at these people. I call them the beautiful ladies. And you’re not allowed to say that anymore.
(01:34:17)
It’s the end of your political career. You say beautiful. You’re barely allowed to say ladies, right? Because that could also be destructive. But they’re beautiful, they’re ladies, and they’re great, and they’ve been to 216 rallies, from North Carolina. They look great. Happily married. I got to talk to their husbands. I don’t know. Way over 200 rallies and they’re incredible people. Thank you very much, by the way. Thank you. Appreciate it. Together we will stop Kamala Harris’s nation wrecking… I’ll tell you what, when you see what she’s done to our nation, she’s wrecking our nation. The radicalism will. Take back our country from the worst administration in American history. Biden was the worst president in the history of our country. She’s acknowledged to be the worst vice president in the history of our country. She doesn’t have a clue. If she doesn’t have a teleprompter, she can’t even speak. Did you see her the other night? They put a camera in her face, she can’t even talk. We just went through four years. Let’s not go through another four.
(01:35:35)
Can’t talk. No, it was terrible. By the way, I’d like to congratulate Vladimir Putin for having made yet another great deal. Did you see the deal we’ve made? Now look, we want to get people in. We got 59 hostages. I never paid anything. They released some of the greatest killers anywhere in the world, some of the most evil killers they got, and we got our people back. But boy, we make some horrible, horrible deals. And it’s nice to say we got them back. But does that set a bad precedent? Burt, right? Does that set a bad… Does that set a bad precedent, Burt? Harris has the most ultra-left-wing agenda of any presidential candidate ever in history. There’s never been anybody like this. She is considered more left-wing than crazy Bernie Sanders. Look at her. She’s worse than Bernie, and she happens to be really a low-IQ individual. She really does. She has a very low IQ.
(01:36:45)
We don’t need a low IQ. President Xi of China said, “Oh, good, we have another one, a low IQ individual.” They love dealing with low IQ. They love dealing with low IQ people, and they got them here. I’ll tell you, we got them all. She is terrible. She’s worse than… I think she’s worse than him. By the way, they really took it away from the guy, right? I don’t feel sorry for him because he’s a bad guy. He’s weaponized the whole thing, and nobody’s ever done that in this country. But he’s a bad guy. But people feel sorry for him. They did a coup. He just doesn’t know it. But actually he does know it. You know that. They said, “Joe, you got 14 million votes. It’s yours, but you’re going to give it up. You’re going to give it up right now, Joe, you’re giving it up right now. No, I’m not. I was elected democratically. I was elected. No, you’re giving it up, Joe. We’re either going to do it the nice way or the hard way, Joe. You’re getting the hell out.”
(01:37:50)
And it was the debate performance. So here’s what happened in the debate. We went there, it was the highest-rated debate ever and… Which was a great compliment. And as I left the debate stage, I took off because other people were entering the stage. You understand. I said, “I don’t want to confront other people.” So we had a great debate. But as I left, CNN, I won’t say who, but they said that was the single greatest debate performance I’ve ever seen. And this went on for two days. They were saying how great I was. On the third day, they didn’t mention that anymore, they said he was terrible. I liked it the first way better. I made him choke, don’t kid yourself. We made him choke. He was choking like a dog. He was choking. He was choking like a dog.
(01:38:45)
And that was the end of him. That was the end from that. Then they said, okay, this was a disaster. So then they started doing interviews with people that are 100% bought. The media, the fake news media, they had some people interviewing him like George Slopidopoulos. ABC. ABC is one of the worst, by the way. They’re all sort of bad when you get right down, but ABC is bad. And they’re asking them hardball questions like “Where did you stay last night? Did you think you did well in the debate, even though you could…” Did you ever see a guy in the debate? They give you two minutes to answer. And you want to use up, you got so much fertility in there, you want to use up every second, and then answer a question. “You have 92 seconds left.” And I kept saying, “I’ll take them.”
(01:39:41)
And he said, “Oh. You have 92 seconds left.” He goes, “Oh.” This is not what he wanted. He left a lot of time on the board, but I went right down to the last second. I didn’t want to go a little bit over because I know they’d cut me. They would have cut me. But they were very fair actually, CNN, shockingly, honestly, they were very fair. They want to do another one. We’re doing one with Fox, if she shows up. I don’t think she’s going to show up. She can’t talk. She can read a teleprompter. I’d give her about a six on a scale of 10, six. For talking I’d give her less than a one. We need people that can talk. Kamala pledged to give free taxpayer-funded healthcare to all illegal aliens. How do you like that idea? Which will destroy social security. She called for the abolition of ICE. Listen, ICE, I know some people here, two of them are really tough guys. They’re fighters. They’re vicious people. They’re good tough people. They don’t want to work for ICE.
(01:40:56)
ICE will go into a pack of MS-13 killers and thugs, and for about two minutes you just see fists flying back and forth back, and then they stand up and they win, and they grab them. They throw them in a paddy wagon. They get them the hell out of the country. And she’s calling them, she’s calling them the equivalent of KKK. Okay? And she loves deadly sanctuary cities. By the way, all of the things you’re hearing now, she’s now denying. But the one good thing about the internet, you press a button and you got it. Although they are trying to delete everything. They changed the picture of me from a couple of weeks ago, and they really radicalized it. They changed it. Using AI they changed it. They had all the people on the stage who were angry and they were smart and sharp and very brave, and they had them all big smiles on their face. “Can you believe that?”
(01:41:56)
They put the agents who, I have to tell you, say what you want, those people were brave. They were running to me, and the bullets were flying. The Secret Service, they were very brave. They were very brave, I can say. They were very brave. They were running at me, and they knew the bullets were going right over my head at that point. The first one was not a good situation. Not a good situation. That was really something incredible. That was from God. That was from God. Because the chances… Yeah, no, that was from God. For all of you non-believers, that one was for God, right? That was a close one. But I just want to say, though they were very brave, they pounced on me. They pounced on me. And I heard those things whizzing over me. They were whizzing. And I have to say that because they take, people take abuse. There were mistakes made. There were mistakes made. Pretty bad ones.
(01:43:15)
But the bravery of that moment was incredible. And also that the sniper, the Secret Service, who’s a phenomenal talented shooter, one bullet from hundreds of yards away, if he doesn’t hit his target and he hit his target, boom. But from hundreds… If he doesn’t hit the target, then you have Cory and a lot of other people that are dead. Cory was great. Two other great gentlemen warriors, great Trump people. We love them. We thought they were going to be gone too. The doctors were incredible. They did a great job, an unbelievable job. But if that sniper, and he had five seconds to think, he did not know about it beforehand, by the way. He had five seconds. He saw the flash and he knew what that was. And within five seconds, he got off a shot. One bullet, think of it, one bullet, and that was the end. Otherwise, you would’ve had many people dead who did a hell of a job. And that was from a very far distance. That was from basically about triple the distance. It was a much longer shot.
(01:44:28)
So we want to thank him, and we want to thank all of the people in Secret Service for their bravery because they were very brave. This was a bad thing. Very brave. But she refuses to even say the words illegal alien or radical Islamic terror. She says, “Nope.” And the main thing, think of this, she wants to let mass amnesty and citizenship, she wants all illegals to have mass amnesty. Everybody. Even criminals. Because many of them that are coming in are from prisons and jails and mental institutions, insane asylums. They hate when I use Dr. Hannibal Lecter as the… Late great Hannibal Lecter… Oh, they go, look at all the media back there. Look at all the fake news. That’s a lot of fake news. That’s a lot of fake news, Burt. But she doesn’t want to get involved. Look, here’s a story. When a politician says something young in life, that’s where they are. That’s what they believe in.
(01:45:43)
Defund the police, all the things that she said. That’s where she would go if she ever got the chance. She’s never going to get the chance. Our country will be destroyed. She’s worse than Biden. She’s worse than Bernie Sanders. She’s Bernie Sanders, but not as smart. That’s the way I view her. I said she’s a dumb version of Bernie Sanders and actually further left than him. She supports mandatory gun confiscation. I’m sure you wouldn’t mind that. Would anybody mind if they came into your house and took away your gun or your guns? Oh, I’m shocked. I’m shocked to hear that. She’s for taking away all of your guns. The problem is they won’t take them away from the bad guy. The bad guys are not giving up the guns. The good guys are going to, “Oh, well, yes ma’am. Here’s my gun. Thank you.” Now you’re totally defenseless in your house. No, you can’t do that.
(01:46:37)
She said that a 70 to 80% tax hike is “A bold idea that should be discussed.” Oh, that’s nice. She co-sponsored the $100 trillion green new scam. She wants to abolish all oil and coal and natural gas. “We want to work on wind. Wind. We want to have wind blowing.” She vowed to ban fracking. She wants the government to stop people from eating red meat. She wants to get rid of your cows. No more cows. No more cows. Oh, it’s serious. In Europe, you smile and you think about it, but in Europe, they’re sort of doing it. They don’t want any cattle. She wants to get rid of gas-powered cars and replace them with all electric. They don’t go far. They cost too much. They’re all made in China. Other than that, they’re fantastic. And I’m for electric cars. I have to be, because Elon endorsed me very strongly, Elon. So I have no choice. But he knows.
(01:47:39)
No, I am for them. I’m for them for a small slice is a slice. But you want to have gas-propelled cars. You want to have hybrids. You want to have every kind of a car imaginable. They want to go all electric, and there’s no way you can ever, there’s no way you can ever load them up. They call them loading them. You can’t load them. We’re going to have to spend $9 trillion in the middle West. You saw they were built chargers. Now a charger is a gas pump with electricity come through. Is that good? So it’s like a… For eight chargers they spent $9 billion. Is that a good deal? So at that rate, it would be $10 trillion to charge up the country. The whole thing is crazy, right? Mr. Preacher, she wants to get rid of two very special words to me. And I came up with this because I noticed when you went into stores, I used to go into stores. Now I wouldn’t want to go into stores because they have everything under lock and key.
(01:48:42)
You ever see they have bars up, they have glass up. I don’t know how you can do business like that. “I’d like to buy a toothpaste, please. Oh, wait till the clerk comes.” 25 minutes a clerk… They opened this heavy glass armor door. “Ah, here’s to…” How the hell do you make money doing that? It used to be that if somebody robbed your store, you would be very tough about it, right? Now, Kamala started this. Anything under a thousand dollars, you can do whatever you want. And these guys are sitting out there. You ever see them? They’ve got paper. “Okay, you go ahead. Oop, that’s over that. Drop that back. Put that…” There’s no crime if it’s less than a thousand dollars. She’s the one who started it. She’s a lunatic. She wants to get rid of these two very special words. You remember I used to bring it up all the time in 2016. By the way, we did much better in 2020 than we did in 2016, but these are minor details.
(01:49:46)
We did much better. They said, “What was the difference?” I said, “Well, we got millions of more votes.” You know that too. But we’re not going to let that happen again. Ready? The two words are Merry Christmas. She doesn’t want anybody saying Merry Christmas. Now she’s denying it. And then they found the tape last night. She’s such a liar. She denies all this stuff. She said, “I was not the border czar.” She was the… York Times, there’s a headline, Border Czar. She was the border czar. She was the worst border czar, she was the worst czar in history. Kamala’s radical ideas belong in a San Francisco commune filled with far-left freaks, but they do not belong in the White House. They do not belong in the United States of America. This November, Georgia is going to tell Kamala that we will not let her turn America into a communist country. Remember I used to say, “We will never be a socialist country.” Well, I was right. They skipped socialism, they’ve got… I was right. I was right. It will never be a socialist country.
(01:50:53)
I’d say that, State of the Union, I said, “We will not ever allow our country to be a socialist country.” I was right. It’s gone communist. It skipped socialism. It never stopped. The train never stopped at the socialism world. The world of socialism, not a good one, but the world of communism is many times worse. Now that they’ve swapped out Biden, is he going to the Democrat Convention? This is a big question. I’d like to go to watch Kamala get sworn in as they ripped it away from him. They took away his presidency. What do you think, Mr. Congressman? You had a very good speech. Didn’t he make a good speech? What do you think about ripping away… There’s socialism there… What do you think about ripping away the guy’s presidency? Right? That’s not democracy. Remember the words they used? They are a threat to democracy. They’ve been saying that about me for seven years. I think I got shot because of that. Okay? People said he’s a threat to democracy. No, I’m the one that is saving democracy. It’s true. They’re a threat.
(01:52:12)
Thank you. Wow. That’s nice. Thank you, Marjorie. No, we’re saving democracy. Wow. I’m going to use that more often. I’ve never used that before. I’m always hitting them, I should say, instead, I’m going to save democracy and get a nice ticket. It is true though. Certain phrases get amazing response, like “I will keep men out of women’s sports.” Now you find out I’m right. I used to use the barbells. Now all you have to do is look at the boxers. This young girl from Italy, a champion boxer. She got hit so hard, she didn’t know what the hell hit her. It’s a person that transitioned. He was a good male boxer. Yeah, he was a good male boxer. And she didn’t even go down. He hit her with two jabs and she said, “I’m out.” How crazy is it? The weight lifters are great though, because they put a quarter of an ounce here, a quarter of an ounce here, and she goes, by the way, first Lady of the United States hates when I do this. She says, “It’s so damn unpresidential.”
(01:53:39)
I said, “But the people like it.” Right, Marjorie? She doesn’t like it. She’s a very elegant woman. She doesn’t like it. Should I do it, Marjorie? So, no, no, our first lady, she said, “You know, your speech was great, but this weightlifting thing is so unelegant. And please don’t imitate him not being able to find stairs, because every time you do it, they say it was you that couldn’t find the stairs.” True. I’m very careful because the press is among the most dishonest human beings in history. They know. Bruce knows. The great Bruce Lavelle. Stand up, Bruce. He’s been with me from before I ran. He was with me in 2014 saying, “That guy in New York should run. He’ll be great president.” That was long before I even… I didn’t even know about it. I think you might have convinced me to run. I don’t know. Some of these people… Some people have been with me long before I ran. They would say, “Trump should run that.”
(01:54:43)
We had Romney, remember Romney, and they did Paul’s. Romney and Paul Ryan. What a combination that was. Whoops. There we go off Fox. Fox just went off. No, Paul Ryan’s on the board of Fox. What a mistake that was. But they had Romney and Paul Ryan, what a team that was. They got clobbered. They got clobbered. The choice of this election could not be more stark. On the one hand, you have a radical left freak. You have a candidate who is fake, fake, fake. On the other hand, you have a president who will fight, fight, fight for America. Fight, fight, fight. I will, I promise. I will. By the way, the fire marshal, I love him. Could the school people allow… There’s some seats right up there. They could let them come in. I don’t know what you’re doing. I don’t know what you’re doing. Let the people come in. They’re standing outside, thousands of them. Let them come in. It’s obviously, Marjorie, a very liberal school, I guess, right? Not happy with the school.
(01:56:20)
Let them come in. They’re standing. It’s 95 degrees out. Let them come in. There’s some seats. They got thousands of people, they won’t let them in. A Harris presidency, you know why? Because they don’t want to show that we’re successful, that’s all it is. They don’t want to show… She has to go get entertainers. They start leaving as soon as she opens her mouth. Well Hillary used to do that too. I remember she got Bruce Springsteen. I’m not a huge fan. I have a bad trait. I only like people that like me. Does that make sense? And these people like me, Burt, right? These people like me. No, no, Hillary used to do it all the time. She got the idea from Hillary. Hillary got Bruce Springsteen, I’ll never forget. And the place was pretty full, not full like our places are full, and I don’t have a guitar. I don’t have a guitar. I don’t have a guitar. But our places are bigger. We get more people than anybody.
(01:57:29)
I don’t care how many guitars they have. In New Jersey, we had 107,000 people come. Nobody has that. Nobody. In Alabama, we had 68,000 people. In South Carolina we had 82,000 people. That had closed up the whole state. We even did one in the South Bronx in New York. Rough place. But boy, it was love. 25,000 people. It was love. But I’ll never forget that, Hillary and she had Bruce… and they were all saying, “Oh, she drew 25,000 people,” or something. Then he finished with the concert. She starts speaking and everyone’s leaving. I said, “That’s not working out so good. That’s not working out.” But I don’t know. You have to be real. People show up, people show up. To do that, I don’t know. There’s something pretty phony about it. But she had somebody… Who did she have? Who was the entertainer that she had? Do you know? Yeah. Yeah. That’s what I think. By the way, the entertainer couldn’t fill the place either. Even with the help of the school, the school’s trying to get students, “Please go. This is embarrassing to us. Please go.”
(01:58:44)
No. Wasn’t Hillary a beauty when I campaigned against her. She said, “Look at him. Look at him. Just look at those words he uses. He will start wars.” No, no, I had no wars. I got rid of ISIS, a hundred percent of ISIS, but that was already [inaudible 01:59:02] I was the one that had no wars. First time in 80 years. In California, Harris was the original Marxist prosecutor. She was in the role of Fannie Willis. Has anybody ever heard of Fannie Willis? You know Fannie Willis is a good friend of your governor. You know that? Your governor. I’m not a fan of your governor. But she was in the role of Fannie Willis or Larry Krasner, George [inaudible 01:59:33] Alvin Bragg of New York. He goes after me. He goes after me because of the Justice Department. Never happened before. The DA of San Francisco. Harris shielded, illegal alien, crack dealers from deportation.
(01:59:45)
She wouldn’t let them be deported. She fought like hell. She wouldn’t arrest criminals of the worst kind. She wouldn’t arrest murderers. She wouldn’t arrest anybody. The state has gone to hell. Gavin Newscum is the worst, one of the worst guys. Gavin Newscum. But she was the one that started it. She ruined San Francisco, ruined California. As California attorney general she defined and redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon and rape of a unconscious person, an unconscious person raped, as nonviolent. These were nonviolent crimes. We shouldn’t even prosecute these people. To help spring child predators and dangerous criminals out of prison all over the state. And during the left-wing riots of 2020, you saw that, she urged for followers to donate to bail rapists and murderers out of jail while saying that the violent mobs should not stop. They should not stop. She said… She was endorsing defund the police. And she said, “Violent mobs, let the violent mobs keep going.
(02:00:56)
Let them keep going. We love what they’re doing. We love what they represent.” This is the lunatic that the fake news is trying to build up to be the next Margaret Thatcher. Four months ago, she was considered grossly incompetent by the fake news. Now they’re saying, “Oh, isn’t she wonderful? Isn’t she wonderful?” No, she’s not wonderful. So we have to work hard to define her. I don’t want to even define her. I just want to say who she is. She’s a horror show. She’ll destroy our country. For years she is pushed legislation to strip police officers of any protection. They have no protection. Anything they do, they get sued, they go bankrupt, they lose their house, they lose their family, they lose their pension, they ruin their lives. They want to ruin their lives. She was the worst at ruining police officers. And by the way, I have the endorsement of virtually every police organization in the United States, almost everywhere. And when I’m President of the United States, again, we will never defund the police. We will only over fund. We’re going to over fund the police if we have to. I will always give our law enforcement heroes the protection, resources, and respect that they so dearly deserve. And like other Marxist DAs… And she was the first of them. She was horrible. She was horrible. She had a very good friend named Willie Brown. I liked Willie Brown. He knows more about her than anybody’s ever known. He could tell you every single thing about her, could tell you stories that you’re not going to want to hear. Like other Marxist DAs, Kamala supports abolishing cash bail, which means bloodthirsty criminals that just killed somebody can immediately leave custody, go out and kill somebody else, which, by the way, they often do.
(02:03:04)
Under these kinds of woke radical left policies, Atlanta is like a killing field. And your governor ought to get off his ass and do something about it. Just a few weeks ago, two 13-year-old boys were murdered. And an 11-year-old was shot while sitting outside their house in Southwest Atlanta. In June, a 47-year-old man, a 69-year-old woman, and a 70-old woman were shot in the middle of the day, shot right through the head, in the food court of Peach Tree Center, what a nice name, in downtown Atlanta, where you can’t even walk anymore. The shooter had been previously arrested 11 times, but they think it was 24 times.

Donald Trump (02:04:00):

He’d gone to prison for assault and armed robbery many times. Since I was president, aggravated assaults in Atlanta are up 17%, and there’s a 20% increase in shoplifting and a 90% increase in overall crime. Murders are up massively, murders. You go to the store, “I want to buy a loaf of bread, darling.” You come back, “Ma’am, I’m sorry, but your husband’s been killed. He went for bread across the street. He’s been shot to death, ma’am.”
(02:04:33)
Nationwide, there’s been a 43% increase in violent crimes since I left office, including a 58% increase in rape, 89% increase in aggravated assault, and a 56% increase in stone-cold robbery. July 4th weekend in Chicago, 117 people were shot. I’m not talking about… I’m talking about shot. Not aimed at and missed, but I can guarantee you that number was big. But 117 people were shot. Of the 117, 17 died. Many are going to be incapacitated. They’re going to be working for the rest of their lives just to move. Many are paralyzed. Many of those people are paralyzed right now. Nobody ever talks about that. 117 people shot, 17 died; many very seriously hurt for the rest of their lives.
(02:05:31)
If Kamala wins, it will be crime, chaos, and death all across our country. We’re going to have just the opposite. It’s up to the governors and the mayors to run things, but with Minnesota, which was a disaster, Minneapolis state crimes. You remember the CNN reporter? “This is a friendly riot. Oh, please, I had rather not use the word riot. This is a friendly get-together.” And behind him, the whole city is burning down. Remember that? Remember, it was like the flames were going for miles. And then he got hit on the knee with something. I think it was a hand grenade that didn’t go off. Remember him with the shaved head? Ding, ding, ding. Shaved his head. “How do I look?” “Great.” Then he goes down, a hand grenade hits him. “How do I look, darling?” “Oh, you look great.” They call it the summer of love, remember?

Speaker 4 (02:06:23):

Yes.

Donald Trump (02:06:24):

They took over Seattle 20%. If I didn’t have the soldiers ready to go that morning, that Seattle would still be occupied. They actually took over a large percentage of Seattle. Portland, What they did with Portland. I was in the real estate business. I love storefronts beautiful bronze, I love bronze and everything. Storefronts so beautiful. In Portland, you know what they have a storefront? Their storefronts have been so decimated they use old two-by-fours with a wooden door; no glass, no windows. It’s the worst looking avenue I’ve ever seen because… And I spoke to people that have shops there, but they don’t have them anymore; they’ve all fled. But the few people that remain, they have wooden storefronts made out of old lumber. And they said, “No, anything we put up, including this will be knocked down the next time.” And it happens on a weekly basis and nobody does anything about it.
(02:07:19)
They knew the military was coming in the next day in Seattle. If they didn’t know that and they fled, they all said, “Oh, it’s about time to get it.” When they were doing monuments in Washington, Marjorie knows this, I got an old bill because I doubt we could ever get Congress to pass one like this, and they were trying to rip down monuments. And then it was Abraham Lincoln. They were going to rip down the monument to Abraham Lincoln. They were ripping down other monuments. They didn’t care who it was, they just wanted to destroy our country. And I took this old bill from 1889. Today you wouldn’t have the guts to sign a thing like that, although they should. They should make it even tougher. And it said, “If you desecrate or even touch a monument in any way, shape, or form, you go to jail for 10 years.” And there’s no shortened sentence. There’s no shortened sentence. There’s no like you get nine years off for good behavior. No, it’s 10 years and you’re not allowed to even do that. No judge is allowed to do it. In fact, it was so old when I had… I’m saying, “This is an old sucker.” This thing is old, but I reinstituted it. It was so severe, frankly, that they didn’t use it.
(02:08:36)
And then I had a press conference, you remember, and I announced anybody… And people were doing lassoes of those gorgeous horses and all the things up there, and yet you saw it the other day; they were doing it again in Washington, DC with spray paint into limestone and granite. The limestone, it’s a very porous stone. And I was very good at this. I was a builder, as you may have heard. And the limestone, that paint goes in there, sucks. In 100 years, you’ll see that. There’s nothing you can do. It just goes right in. It’s very, very porous. It’s sand, basically, beautiful sand. Beautiful lions, beautiful monuments, the bells and everything desecrated. And I wonder what happened to those people. Probably nothing. Probably nothing. What they did, they did tremendous damage. They did tremendous damage.
(02:09:23)
But so I announced this bill, and the bill… I had a press conference to announce it, and I said, “10 years for anybody even touching any of our beautiful monuments.” You know what happened? It was a beautiful site. I saw thousands of asses, only the back walking out of town; some were running. They didn’t want to do anything, they just wanted to get the hell out of town. And that was the end of the problem. We didn’t have any more problem. We had no more problem after that. There was no problem. And that was the end.
(02:09:56)
You didn’t about it after that, Mr. Congressman, did we? Collins. Good speaker, he is. He’s got a future. Does he have a future, Marjorie? I don’t know. Got the look. He’s got the hair. Good job. I watched. Good job.
(02:10:13)
We will restore law and order to America. We will bring back public safety to the great state of Georgia, which is doing very badly in that way. And on day one, we will seal the border, stop the invasion, and send the illegal aliens back home. And we’ll do it very quickly, very quickly. For three and a half years, borders are Harris. And again, she refuses to acknowledge that she was the borders there. She was the worst, worst manager we’ve ever had ever.
(02:10:51)
And by the way, all of the people in charge of the border, they’ve all endorsed me. They said, “He was the greatest president we’ve ever had.” Tom Homan, Brandon Judd, all of those guys, they’ve all endorsed me, and they said, “She’s the worst.” It’s hard for them to say that, but they said, “There’s never been anybody so incompetent.” For three and a half years, borders are Harris; has allowed terrorists and criminals to pour across our wide, open border. And now she’s denying it. You can’t fall for it. Disinformation, deny, deny, deny, deny for a year. “Were never there. Nothing happened. We were great. We were great. We were so tough.” And some people will start to believe it. They used the word brainwashed. Did you ever hear the word brainwashed?

Speaker 4 (02:11:36):

Yes.

Donald Trump (02:11:36):

Mitt Romney’s father used that word. It wasn’t good when he used that word. It destroyed his career. But they were brainwashed. Some people get. They hear it over and over again how bad they were and they say how great a job they did. “They did great. They did great.” They say it again and again, and all of a sudden people… And don’t forget, it’s not their main thing. They’re accountants, they’re lawyers, they’re taxi drivers, they’re carpenters, they’re electricians, they hear it over and over again. All of a sudden, they say, “She was really great on the border, wasn’t she?” No, she was a disaster. She has destroyed our country. We’re going to bring it back, but she has destroyed our country. She’s incompetent.
(02:12:16)
They’re coming from South America, they’re coming from Asia, they’re coming from Africa and the Middle East, from prisons and jails. They’re coming from all over the world. They’re not just coming from South America. Everyone thinks, oh, South America. They want to vote in Spanish and they’re going to… By the way, we are doing better with the Hispanic population, I think, now than they are, so that’s not working out too well. But they’re coming from all over the world, not just South America. They’re coming from the Congo in Africa. A lot are coming from the Congo, from prisons. “Where do you come from?” “The Congo.” “Oh. What’s your address?” “We live in prison.” “What did you do?” ” Murder.” “Oh. Welcome to the United States of America.”
(02:13:06)
The only good thing is, I say this all the time, these people are so violent and vicious that are being brought into our country, they’re so violent, so vicious that they make our gang members and bad people and criminals look like the nicest people on earth. When we see an MS-13-some person now, we say, “Well, they’re not that bad.” These are the worst people anywhere in the world coming into our country. They’re coming in at levels that nobody’s ever seen before. There’s nothing good about it. Nothing can be made of it.
(02:13:38)
And they’re actually trying to get them to sign up and vote. They don’t even speak the language. They don’t even know where the hell they are. They want them to sign up and vote. And we have the head of our great Republican Party here, and he is not letting it happen, wherever you may be, wherever you may be. You’re doing a great job. You know that, right? They’re coming in and they’re trying to sign them up.
(02:14:05)
Because I used to say only two reasons this could be happening. They hate our country or they’re stupid. Well, they’re not stupid because anybody that can cheat on elections that good is not stupid. And they do, I really believe they do to a certain extent hate our country because why? But I never really talked about the third reason because it’s so sinister, but they want to sign these people up to vote, and if they do that, this country is destroyed. We’ve become a dumping ground for the entire world, and we’re not going to take it anymore.
(02:14:45)
Just a few months ago, right here in your state, I met with the devastated family, what a beautiful family of Laken Riley, the brilliant 22-year-old nursing student, top of her class who was out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia when she was assaulted, beaten, and horrifically killed. Her family, look, they’ll never be the same. Incredible family.
(02:15:13)
Kamala Harris let in the savage monster who murdered Laken. He was an illegal alien who was in border patrol custody, but under Harris’s policies, instead of being deported immediately and fast, he was set free into America. ” Please enjoy your stay.” Laken’s blood is on Kamala Harris’ hands. And she was in charge of the border. But there are many, many people like that. Laken is not the only one. Kamala is responsible for the death as though she was standing there watching it herself. She was responsible, and for so many more.
(02:15:57)
Three days after releasing Laken’s killer into the United States, Harris went on television and lied to the American people saying, “The border is secure.” Quote, “The border is secure.” What kind of a politician lies to Americans about keeping the border open while precious young girls are being assaulted and killed?
(02:16:17)
And Laken is one where the press was very strong on it, but there are thousands of people that are being killed and being criminalized and victimized by these people that are pouring into our country. I call it migrant crime. We now have migrant crime in our country. It’s a new form of crime. It’s called migrant crime, and it’s vicious and it’s really bad. Kamala Harris should not be asking for your vote, she should be begging Laken Riley’s family for forgiveness.
(02:16:50)
And Joe Biden never would mention her name. Do you remember when Biden wouldn’t mention her name? Because Laken was really… That was a big deal. That was a very horrible… Just horrific. And he wouldn’t mention her name, and then he finally did it, and then he called her the wrong name, “Lincoln.” Called her Lincoln. Good coach, Lincoln Riley. Good coach. Maybe that’s where it came from, but called her Lincoln. And he was so bad. He’s such a bad president, such a bad president. And precedent was set by having him as a president. He was a disaster for this country. You get angry talking about it because it’s almost impossible to believe you can be that bad.
(02:17:46)
People like certain people. And I understand it; they could have different beliefs, different policies. Like Ronald Reagan, he had something special about him. There was an aura. I didn’t agree. I didn’t agree with him on trade. I didn’t think he was as good on trade as he could have been. Could have tougher on trade. But he had something special. But this last group, there’s nothing they have. They have nothing. I call him Crooked Joe for a reason. He’s crooked. I also call him Sleepy Joe. He’s sleepy. He’s sleepy, he’s crooked, he’s incompetent, he’s dumb, and she’s worse, she’s worse. If Harris wins, a never ending stream of illegal alien rapists, MS-13 animals, and child predators will flood into your communities.
(02:18:32)
If I win, on day one, we will begin the largest deportation operation in American history. Have no choice. We have no choice. No country can sustain this. We have no choice. And we will immediately expel every single criminal that border Czar Harris has allowed into our country. No country can sustain it. In a recent CBS poll, 62% of American support large-scale deportation, and others are saying it’s 83%, 85%, including 53% of Hispanic voters because they see what’s happening.
(02:19:17)
By the way, the Hispanic voter and me have this special relationship. I understand them. They’re very entrepreneurial, very smart, but they also understand security better than anybody. And they don’t want to have murderers released into our country. They don’t want. It’s very interesting. And I built massive amounts of the wall. The wall was incredible. We built it, and hundreds of miles of wall, and they wanted it more than anybody because it worked. Remember I used to say two things work. Everything else is obsolete after two. You do a new computer, in about three weeks is totally obsolete. Nobody wants it. Two things have never been obsolete: wheels and walls. Wheels work and walls work. And you have a lot of different things becoming obsolete, but the wheel in the wall, the walls work. Harris wants to be the president for criminals and illegal aliens. I will be the president for law-abiding Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed.
(02:20:20)
And it’s no wonder the Democrat Party and their thugs are so desperate to stop us. They know that we are the only ones who can stop them. We’re the only ones that are going to be able to stop. Nobody else is going to be able to stop these lunatics. All of their persecution of me is only happening because I am running for president and leading very big in all of the polls. If I wasn’t running for president, I could be vacationing next to one of the many beautiful oceans of the world as the waves come in. Beautiful, but it’s boring. I’d rather be with you figuring out this mess, figuring out this mess that we’ve gotten ourselves into. We’re going to figure it out. We’ve got it figured out.

Speaker 4 (02:21:09):

We love Trump, we love Trump.

Donald Trump (02:21:12):

Thank you.

Speaker 4 (02:21:13):

We love Trump, we love Trump, we love Trump, we love Trump, we love Trump.

Donald Trump (02:21:25):

Thank you very much.

Speaker 4 (02:21:25):

We love Trump, we love Trump.

Donald Trump (02:21:30):

Now we have two things we have to do. We have to vote and we have to make sure that we stop them from cheating, because they cheat like dogs. I don’t know if you’ve heard, but the Georgia State Election Board is in a very positive way. This is a very positive thing, Marjorie. They’re on fire. They’re doing a great job. Three members, Janice Johnson, Rick Jeffries, and Janelle King. Three people are all pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency, and victory. They’re fighting. Are they here? Where are they? Where are they? Where are they? Thank you. What a job. Thank you. Thank you. Wow.But we have a couple of other members that aren’t so good. We have some that aren’t so good, but these three are really doing the job because they don’t want to see this… That will destroy our country.
(02:22:38)
They just passed a rule for Georgia elections requiring that three people at each precinct independently count the total number of ballots before certification. Who could be against that? Who could be against it? Thank you, Janice, very much. That’s really amazing. Thank you all, thank you all. Those are great people. I’d say brave, but I mean to you it’s like that you got to do what you have to do. It’s not like a question of brave. They said I was brave two weeks ago. I had to do what I had to do. It’s not like brave, it’s just we do the right thing. Go.

Speaker 4 (02:23:14):

[inaudible 02:23:18].

Donald Trump (02:23:17):

All right, thank you.

Speaker 4 (02:23:18):

Your courage is contagious.

Donald Trump (02:23:19):

My courage was contagious. Well, your courage is contagious too. Thank you. Thank you. Nice. It’s amazing. People want it. That’s what they want. Thank you, Janice. That’s great. And those three people are incredible.
(02:23:55)
Let me give you the bad news. It’s that for whatever reason, Brad Raffensperger and Brian Kemp, your governor… Who I got elected, by the way. Who wasn’t for me, he would not be your governor. I think everybody knows that. He’s a very disloyal person, is indeed very disloyal. But these two are doing everything possible. Plus your attorney general would like to see him show up and do something.
(02:24:27)
Look at the love and adulation and applause, because this is like a poll, this is like a poll. We have thousands of people. That’s better than going out and paying a half a million dollars to have some pollster go out and poll 212 people. Look at this. Look at the love they have for Janice. That’s what people want. They want to have honest elections, and they want to have strong borders. Very simple.
(02:24:55)
But your governor, Kemp and Raffensperger are doing everything possible to make 2024 difficult for Republicans to win. What are they doing? I don’t know. They got something in mind. They got a little something in mind. Kemp is very bad for the Republican Party. He wouldn’t do anything.
(02:25:15)
We have Bert Jones over here. We have Bert Jones. All he wanted in the Senate was to have a special resolution passed, and it was all done. Every senator wanted it, every Republican wanted it. And we have Senator Beech here someplace too. Where is Senator Beech? Oh, I can’t forget him. We can’t forget him. A warrior, a warrior, you know that, and many others in this group.
(02:25:44)
But all they wanted was to have just a special… We want to go over the election. We want to look because there’s too many things. And the governor wouldn’t sign it. And I knew he would because I got him elected. I sent a young guy over to his office, “Would you please have him sign this?” And the kid came back. He said, “Sir, he won’t sign.” “Of course he will. I got him elected. Give me a break. Of course he will.” “No, he wouldn’t.” And then I said, “Well, go back over. Tell them it’s for me. It’s a good thing, not a bad thing. They want to look into possible election fraud.” Wouldn’t you say, senator, that’s a good thing, right? They want to look into election fraud.
(02:26:21)
It comes back, “Sir, I said it was for you.” This was a few years later after I won him the election. Don’t forget, I endorsed him. And you had a very good man, Casey Cagle, your lieutenant governor. He was going to win easily. And David Perdue. Where’s David? I love David. But that was his only mistake. He said, “Sir, would you endorse a friend of mine, Brian Kemp?” I said, “Who’s Brian Kemp?” He said, “He’s a friend of mine,” sir. And Sonny came too. This was probably the only mistake of David’s life. That was a beauty, David. Thanks, David, I appreciate it.
(02:26:55)
And I endorsed this guy. He was way down on the list. He was doing terribly. My endorsement means a lot, and I’m very careful with it. And I endorsed him, and he won in a landslide. And then he said, “I can’t beat Stacey Abrams. I can’t beat her. She’s going to be too tough.” And she felt that too, by the way. She still feels it. She’s constantly saying she won the election. She can say it, but I’m not allowed to say it, I’m not allowed to say it. And Michaela, I love you, Michaela. I’m in love with Michaela. Please explain that to Melania. Please explain that to our first lady. You are fantastic. No, you are a special person.
(02:27:42)
But I endorsed him. And then she said, “I can’t beat Stacey Abrams.” He said that. And his wife said it too. I said, “Well, you won the nomination, so let’s do some big rallies.” And I did them out at an airport. Massive rallies; 55,000 and 52,000. There may have even been a third. I don’t know. I remember two monster rallies. And I said, “You’re going to win.” He said, “I don’t think so, sir.” I said, “No, you’re going to win. I’m telling you. I can tell the vibe of the people.” I’m like, I think, David, 287 and 0 in the last 12 months with endorsements. People respect my endorsement and I respect them. And I love them, I love them.
(02:28:28)
I did these two big rallies, and he won. He did win. He won by 2%. And his wife looked at me and said, “Thank you, sir. We’ll never ever be able to repay you for what you did. You got my husband the nomination, and then we beat somebody who was unbeatable.” She was, in theory, unbeatable. She was the hottest politician in the country at the time, Democrat politician. I would say I was hotter because I was president, so I was hotter. No, I’m not. I’m only kidding, Marjorie. I’m only kidding. Although maybe I’m not kidding, actually. No, she was certainly the hottest Democrat politician in the country. And she was going wild for years. She’s still going. She can’t even believe.
(02:29:11)
But I got him by doing massive rallies. I really worked hard. He’s the most disloyal guy I think I’ve ever seen. But think of the wife. “We can never repay you for what you’ve done, sir. We could have never won.” And now she said two weeks ago that, “I will not endorse him because he hasn’t earned my…” I haven’t earned her endorsement. I have nothing to do with her. Somewhere he went bad. And you know what? Your numbers in Georgia are very average. Your crime numbers, your economic numbers, all of your numbers, you’re a very average. You can do a lot better. And you’ll do a lot better with a better governor. You can do a lot better, just so you understand. But I don’t want her endorsement, I don’t want his endorsement, I just want them to do their job for Georgia. And you know what? He’s the governor. He ought to support his Republican Party because if he doesn’t have his Republican Party, I could tell you where he came from, and it wasn’t good.
(02:30:14)
And you have a great leader of the Republican Party right here. Stand up, please. He has done an unbelievable job. And he has to work like hell with a governor that doesn’t help him. And Raffensperger ought to make sure that the vote is honest. And they don’t want the vote to be honest. In my opinion, they want us to lose. That’s actually my opinion. And we can’t let that happen because if we lose Georgia, we lose the whole thing and our country goes to hell. Because we can’t have her be president of the United States. She’s grossly incompetent. We can’t let that happen. They’re the ones.
(02:30:53)
Don’t forget who got Fani Willis and her loverboy boyfriend all jazzed up. This guy, the governor, the governor. You know what? She’s an embarrassment to the state of Georgia. He’s the governor of Georgia. He ought to do something. Many, many people, their lives have been… Forget about me. I’m used to it. It’s true. I am used to fake crap that goes on with these politicians. But many, many people, their lives have been destroyed because of Fani, F-A-N-I, Fani. You have to pronounce it Fani. It’s called Fani. You have to pronounce Fani. She should add a little U in there someplace if she wants be able to call her… No, her and her lover, loverboy Wade, she hired him because of experience. Paid him almost $1 million a year for experience. He’s got great experience. He never did a thing like this in his life. He knew nothing about it. The only thing he knew about was something else. He knew about that. That’s all he knew about. He didn’t know a damn thing. Do you know him? Have you ever met him? A couple of times. You ever see the phone records, phone calls being made at 3:00 in the morning. Every single night, phone call, phone call from her house. And he said, “No, not well. I don’t know her well.” No.
(02:32:27)
And this governor, I assume, I don’t know, he could straighten it out because his state has become a laughingstock over it. And you know what? I love this state. I won this state twice, in my opinion. Once I won. And I did much better the second time. And Burt knows it and Beech knows it, and everybody else knows it. He could have ended the travesty with a phone call because I did nothing wrong and neither did all of those good people that are being persecuted. People in their 80s, they signed something because they see what’s going on. I guarantee if I took a vote of this audience, if I said, “What do you think?” I won’t do that. They’ll come and indict you if you say that. Now, they can say it. Stacey Abrams can say that she won; the election is fine. But if we say we won the election, and we did, that’s not fine. We can’t do it.
(02:33:22)
Hillary Clinton is still complaining about the election, even though she called me up that night and conceded. But Hillary Clinton is constantly complaining about it. Nothing happens to her. We have two sides of justice, and we can’t do it anymore. We have to get back to making America great again. We don’t have time for this nonsense.
(02:33:50)
Fani wanted to indict a certain US senator who had nothing at all… He say, “Why are they calling me?” I won’t use his name because I don’t want to hurt him. But she wanted to indict, and somebody along the way stopped her from doing it. She had many, many more people. She was going to indict almost everybody that came into the state for a visit.
(02:34:13)
But Kemp doesn’t want to end it because he’s a bad guy, he’s a disloyal guy, and he’s a very average governor. Little Brian, little Brian Kemp, bad guy. But think of it. Just think, and then that’s it. I got this guy nominated. I then got him elected. Without me, he doesn’t get nominated and he doesn’t get elected. He had no chance of winning either one, and all he had to do is sign something where the Senate would like to look at election integrity. This is an honest man, that’s an honest man. They were all honest. They were looking at something very legitimate. And this bad guy said, “I’m sorry, sir, I can’t do it.” I called him, and

Donald Trump (02:35:00):

I said, “Brian, they’re looking at election integrity. Is there anything you can do?” “I’m sorry sir, I can’t get involved in that.” I said, “But Brian, you don’t understand. This is a good thing, not a bad thing.” “I’m sorry sir. I can’t get involved.” “I’ve had you up to here, Brian, I’ve had you up to here.” He’s a bad guy and he’s not doing this country a good service. People are looking at Georgia with Fani and her lover and all of the other things saying, “What the hell is going on in Georgia? What the hell is going on?” The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020 and we’re not going to let them rig the presidential election in 2024.
(02:35:53)
Every time the radical left Democrats, Marxists, communists, fascists indict me. I consider it a great badge of honor, I do. Because I’m being indicted for you. My father and mother are looking down. They were great people. They’re saying, “My son got indicted like four times. Al Capone didn’t get indicted four times. He would kill you if he didn’t like your look. If you looked at him in the slightly… That’s a nice shirt.” Scarface, Al Capone the most evil man. He didn’t get indicted like Trump. I get indicted for what? I’m protesting an election that was rigged. This guy didn’t get indicted, my father would say, “But Alphonse Capone didn’t get indicted. He killed hundreds of people,” if he took you out for dinner even you see you two guys, would you stand up with a MAGA black please? Stand up please. Look at these two guys. Who the hell is going to mess? Who’s going to mess with that? MAGA black. I love them. I like them better than you, Bruce. Now, those are two tough cookies, but if Alphonse Capone didn’t like you because you insulted him slightly at dinner, that was the end of you, fellas, I have to tell you. And he didn’t get like me. Think of it. How crazy is the world? And thank you for being here. You’re good-looking guys. Better looking than Bruce, I’ll tell you right now, much. Stand up, Bruce. Never forget. Thank you. But never forget our enemies want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom. They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you. And in the end, they’re not after me, they’re after you. I just happen to be standing in their way. So I want to introduce a few warriors if I could please, and they’re incredible people. They really are.
(02:37:56)
And every night I do this where I get in trouble because I’m always leaving somebody out. I’m leaving a congressman out. I’m leaving a guy, it’s brutal. So I end up going on the internet and thanking him and I love him and all the stuff or her, but it’s always tricky. But I know these are people that are here and I want to just thank him for joining us. You’re a great Lieutenant Governor who’s really great, Burt Jones. And his father is here. His father’s a legend in… He is a legend, literally in Georgia as an incredible politician and then he left. He didn’t lose. He left and he went into business and he’s been tremendously successful. He really is a legend. His name is Bill Jones. Does anybody know Bill Jones? Bill, where is Bill?
(02:38:52)
Good. I saw him backstage. He’s fantastic. Representative Mike Collins. Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mike. Thank you. Where is the preacher that was back there talking to me? Where is he? Huh? Oh, he went with your father. Oh, your father. Smart. I always said that, stays with those preachers. Rick Allen and Marjorie Taylor Greene. Thank you, Rick. Thanks Rick. Great job, Rick. Thank you, Marjorie. I’ve known Marjorie from the beginning and she’s an amazing political person. I don’t like to say politician. She’s beyond that. She’s really loved and respected by so many people. And in Washington, when she calls, they get very nervous. Oh please, she’s fantastic. So I thank you both for being here. Appreciate it. And a future congressman, he’ll be one of your best. He’s been with me for eight years and he always wanted to be a congressman.
(02:39:58)
Then his district opened up and he said, do you think I could do it? I said, you have my complete and total endorsement. Brian Jack, Brian Jack, great guy. He’s going to be a great congressman. It’s what he wanted to be and he’s fantastic. You guys are going to love Brian, right? Marjorie. Also, we alluded to him and talked about him, but I am going to talk about him very positively. He was really a great senator. He was a great man in so many different ways. He was respected more than anybody. I mean, everybody respected him in Washington. Very successful businessman that he ran for office, a little bit like the Trump schedule of events, but he was really a fantastic person in Washington, somebody that I was very close to, David Perdue. David, thank you.
(02:40:58)
Doug Collins, will you stand up? Come on. How good was this guy? That’s fantastic. See, I’m glad I spotted him. I would’ve been in big trouble if I didn’t mention him. I’m glad. You know they give me a few names. Who the hell writes these lists out? These people, somebody is getting me in big trouble. It wasn’t that way when I had Brian Jack doing this. I’ll tell you, I got lucky and I see somebody that I know very well. One of the truly great members of the king, of the Martin Luther King family, one of the greats. Will you please stand up? I didn’t see you, my friend from the beginning. I would’ve been in such trouble. If I didn’t mention you, I would’ve been in big trouble.
(02:41:54)
Thank you, darling. One of the truly great people and been with us from the very beginning, I would say, right? Very beginning. Thank you darling. Boy, am I glad I’m looking over this audience. I don’t like this. I’m telling you, this would not have happened if Brian Jack we’re doing it, which he did for many of you. Agriculture Commissioner has done a fantastic job, Tyler Harper. Tyler, thank you very much. Fantastic, thank you.
(02:42:23)
And John King, Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner John. Thank you. Great job, John. Labor commissioner, Bruce Thompson. Bruce, thank you, Bruce. Public Service Commissioners Bubba. I love Bubba McDonnell. I love that name. I want to change my name and Fitz Johnson. Thank you both. Thank you both. And Elvita, good. They did have your name down earlier. I would’ve been in trouble if I didn’t pick… But I picked it even with and Richard Wood, superintendent of schools, who I hear does a great job. Richard, thank you. Thank you Richard. Pastor Benny Tate of the Rock Springs Church. Benny, thank you. Bernie Carrick. Does anybody know Bernie Carrick? Where’s Bernie? Stand up Bernie. He’s the cleanest man in this room. You know that. Bernie’s a great guy. He was a great commissioner in New York. He’s a fantastic man. A well-known local artist with a beautiful painting. Art Lanta. Where is Art Lanta? Oh, wow.
(02:43:45)
That is beautiful. Wow. That is beautiful. I wasn’t going to bring him up. Then I saw the painting. I said, come on up. He goes, maybe he’ll give it to me. Wow, come on up. That’s okay. Is that good? Thank you very much. Wow, that’s fantastic. Wow. Good. That’s a real artist. I brought him up because I thought he was going to give it to him. He didn’t give it to me. He just got me to sign it. I got nothing out of that. Hey Michaela, I know you spoke. Just come up for a second. Come here. This young woman, I walked into… I don’t know what the hell restaurant it was, but I walked into this restaurant and we do it very quietly. We don’t announce, and that’s for security person reasons, everything. I walked in, she’s behind the counter and she didn’t know I was coming. And she goes, “It’s President Trump.” She looks at me, “It’s President Trump. You saved my college.” And I said, “How the hell do you know that?” She said… This one is so smart, so sharp. She grabbed me, she gave me a kiss. I said, I think I’m never going back home to the first lady.

Music (02:46:03):

You were supposed to keep that quiet.

Donald Trump (02:46:05):

See, now the average politician, that’s dead. For me, I don’t care. I just want to tell you, you are an unbelievable person with a great personality. You lit up the whole room. You lit up the whole room. I said weeks later I’d go, who is that person that was so incredible? She knew everything about me. She had no idea I was coming. She knew everything about me and the historically black colleges and universities, I gave millions and millions, billions of dollars to. They kept coming back and I said, why are you doing this? We gave them long-term funding and she knew that because she said her college, which was she loved her college. She said it was so great, right? You loved it.

Music (02:46:50):

The illustrious CAU.

Donald Trump (02:46:52):

Yeah, that’s right. She loved her college and she said, you saved my college. What was your college, tell them?

Music (02:46:57):

The illustrious Clark Atlanta University.

Donald Trump (02:47:05):

And it was so impressive and I felt so good because she really did. She really said… I said, “Did you like the college?” She said, “No, I loved that school. I love that college.” And that’s what it’s all about. But you are an incredible person. I think you have a tremendous future. I really do. And I’ll do whatever I can to help you. Okay, thank you. Thank you much.
(02:47:25)
You want to say something else?

Music (02:47:31):

I thought I was done, but I do want to add on to some of the remarks that were made by others. And we do need to do our best to get the message out there. The fight is nothing if all we do is talk about it amongst ourselves. So with that being said, since you said you’d help me, shameless plug, if y’all need anybody to knock doors, make phone calls, wave signs, get people out to the polls, call me at Conserve the Culture because not only do I mobilize the HBCU students so that they may get this message, but I’m the best person when it comes to black engagement in the black community and nobody needs this message more than my folks. So do y’all care for real? Are y’all with us for real? Conservetheculture.com for any and all inquiries. Y’all can follow me at Ms. Kayla Baby. I’m going to give it back to Big T. And last thing, make sure you guys tune in to my podcast dropping soon on the Patriots Prayer Network. Thank you all.

Donald Trump (02:48:48):

She’s great. Thank you. That’s a great person, great woman. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. From the moment we take back the White House from Kamala and Crooked Joe and he is crooked as a $4 bill. I believe we’re going to have the four greatest years in the history of our country. Starting on day one, we will end inflation and make America affordable again.
(02:49:15)
We’re going to make it affordable again. Thanks to Kamala Harris’s tie breaking vote here in Atlanta, you suffered the highest inflation of any city in the country last year. Good job governor. Great job governor. Under Kamala, the typical Georgia family has lost $28,000 in inflation and to inflation hikes. To bring down the prices of all goods, we will stop the Biden Harris War on American energy. American energy is such a big deal. We will drill, baby drill. We’ll get that number down. We’ll bring energy prices down. Everything else will float with it. We will terminate the green new scam and I will end the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate right on day one. It will be ended. We will pass massive tax cuts for workers and that includes no tax on tips, Michaela.
(02:50:14)
To further protect Georgia workers, I will revoke China’s most favored nation’s trade status. I will pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act. If China or any other country makes us pay a 100 or 200% tariff, we will make them pay a reciprocal tariff of 100 or 200% right back. You heard us, we heard you. It’s an eye for an eye. We’ll take in a fortune and they’ll stop doing it before I even arrive at the Oval Office. Shortly after we win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled and I will prevent, and I’m the only one that’s going to do it. 100% will prevent World War III, which is very close to happening. I will restore peace through strength. And in my next term, we will build a great Iron Dome missile defense shield over our country, a dome like none other, like nobody has ever seen before. And it will all be made in the USA and much of it will be made in the great state of Georgia. And I will not cut 1 cent from Social Security or Medicare. I kept that promise four years ago, and I will keep it again and seniors will not pay taxes on Social Security.
(02:51:42)
We are going to rebuild our cities into beacons of hope, safety, and beauty, better than they have ever been before. We will take over the horribly run capital of our nation in Washington D.C and clean it up, renovate it, rebuild our capital city so there’s no longer a nightmare of murder and crime. We’re going to stop the murder and crime. You go down from your state, you end up getting mugged or murdered in our capitol. It’ll be run tough and strong by our great police officers, but rather we will become the most beautiful capitol anywhere in the world. I could say again, but it’s been so badly run for so long. I almost don’t want to say again. On day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school, pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content onto the shoulders of our children. And I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate.
(02:52:49)
And I will keep men out of women’s sports if that’s okay. If Kamala Harris gets in, the travesty that is taking place at the Paris Olympics will come to America when we host the Los Angeles Olympics. And by the way, which I was president, we happened to get it. I was the president. I also got you a thing called the World Cup, which is coming very soon. I might as well say it myself because nobody else will say it, but I got them both. And you’re going to have a lot of fun with it I hope. Harris is a radical trans activist and she is the candidate of letting men beat up women in the name of tolerance. But you look at what’s happening over in Paris, it will never happen here. I will never let it happen.
(02:53:42)
I will get all males off your daughter’s soccer teams and volleyball teams and get them out of your locker rooms once and for all. That’s going to be cleaned up. And we will fight to make sure that the LA Olympics protects women and protects girls. I will fully uphold the Second Amendment and we will protect innocent life and we will restore free speech in our country. We don’t have free speech any longer. And very importantly, I will sue, and this is so to me, so important what we’ve been through in this country. I will secure our elections. Our goal will be one-day voting with paper ballots, proof of citizenship and voter ID.
(02:54:27)
But until then, Republicans must win. We want a landslide that’s too big to rig. Too big to rig. If you want to save America, get your friends, get your family, get everyone you know and vote. Vote early, vote absentee. Vote on the election day. Do whatever you want, but you have to vote. And if you want to help us ensure election integrity, please sign up, protectthevote.com.
(02:54:56)
So in conclusion, from Marietta to Macon, from Savannah to Columbus, from Augusta to right here in Atlanta, we inherit the legacy of red-blooded American patriots who gave their blood and tears to defend our country and defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the ocean, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up those great big, beautiful skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world.
(02:55:40)
But now we are a nation in decline. We are a failing nation. We are a nation that has lost its confidence, lost its willpower, and lost its strength. We are a nation that has lost its way, but we are not going to allow this horror to continue. Less than four years ago, we were a great nation and we will soon be a great nation again. With our leadership, every disaster, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have created can be fixed and it will be fixed very quickly. Every problem can be solved and every wrong can be rectified.
(02:56:24)
By this time next year, America’s borders will be strong, sealed, and secure. Inflation will be in full retreat. Our economy will be roaring back. It’s going to be roaring back. Optimism will be surging. The American dream will be thriving again for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. Law and justice will reign all throughout our land. Freedom will be restored. The flame of liberty will be burning bright. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, the worst administration in the history of our country, will be a fading memory of the past. And our great silent majority, including the once-forgotten men and women of our country, will be the one shaping America’s magnificent future when I am the 47th President of the United States.
(02:57:21)
Because we are all Americans and together we will show November 5th to be the most important day in the history of our country. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. We will make America free again and we will make America great again. Thank you, Georgia. God bless you all. Go out and vote. God bless you all. Thank you. Thank you.","Atlanta, Georgia","2024-08-05",2,0,0,9,14,16,2,0,0,0
"33",33,"Trump Rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan","https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-rally-in-grand-rapids-michigan","JD Vance (00:03):

Well, I have the distinct honor of getting to talk with you again, but for this time to introduce the next president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. But before I do, let me just say… Sorry.

Audience (00:30):

JD, JD, JD, JD.

JD Vance (00:30):

I had to screw with you a little bit, right?

Audience (00:33):

JD, JD, JD, JD, JD, JD, JD, JD, JD, JD, JD, JD, JD, JD.

JD Vance (00:46):

How do you introduce the guy? Pretty much everybody knows everything about him. They know he was a great president and we want to make him president again. But what I thought I’d say is, what are the qualifications you need to be good president? Well, number one, you need to love this country, right?

Audience (01:06):

Yeah.

JD Vance (01:06):

We’ve got a lot of leaders who don’t love this country, but there are, frankly, if we’re being honest, a lot of people who love this country, you wouldn’t want to make president just because they love the country. You need something else. When I wrote my convention speech, and I wrote it mostly myself, had some help from some friends, but I was looking at the history of President Trump’s engagement with his country. One of the things that jumped out at me is if you think about the biggest mistakes we’ve made as a country, the things that have hurt my home state of Ohio, this state Michigan the most, you could have run through the list of things. I’d start with…

Audience (01:44):

[inaudible 00:01:46]

JD Vance (01:51):

Obviously. Obviously Gretchen Whitmer is a problem. I’m talking about even further back than that.

Audience (01:57):

[inaudible 00:02:03]

JD Vance (02:04):

NAFTA. Given China the sweetheart trade deal and letting him into the World Trade Organization, the Iraq war in 2003. On every single one of those issues, Joe Biden was wrong and President Donald J. Trump was right. Even though he was a real estate developer in New York, he knew instinctively what this country needed and how to put the interests of the citizens of this country first. Now, we had a hell of a four years with President Donald J. Trump, didn’t we?

Audience (02:53):

Yeah.

JD Vance (02:53):

In four years, he undid, I believe, 30 years of damage of terrible leadership. Are we ready to give him four more years?

Audience (03:03):

Yeah.

JD Vance (03:03):

Are we ready to hear from the next president of the United States, President Donald J. Trump? Come on out, sir.

Speaker 1 (03:09):

(singing).

Audience (03:09):

USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.

Donald Trump (05:48):

Well, thank you very much. This is like a Michigan football game over here. This is pretty good. This is pretty good. I want to thank you JD for the introduction. You’re going to be a fantastic vice president of the United States. And I chose him because he’s for the worker. He’s for the people that work so hard and perhaps weren’t treated like they should have been, but they were treated that way four years ago. I can tell you that, but we’re going to get it back, bigger, better, stronger than ever before. Thank you very much. This is some crowd. I’m thrilled to be back in the great state of Michigan with thousands and thousands, and I mean lots of thousands up here. This is a hell of an arena. This is a hell of an arena.
(06:51)
But you are the hardworking patriots that we love. They have crowds of people outside. You’re not even going to believe it. They go blocks and blocks. But let’s forget about them, right? Let’s forget about them. Let me begin this evening with a very special thanks to Americans nationwide, including all of you here today for your extraordinary outpouring of love and support in the wake of the horrific last Saturday event.
(07:25)
When you think of it was exactly one week ago today, almost to the hour even to the minute.

Audience (07:32):

Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.

Donald Trump (07:32):

Incredible.

Audience (07:42):

Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.

Donald Trump (07:42):

Incredible. What a day it was. As I said earlier this week, I stand before you only by the grace of Almighty God. That’s true. I shouldn’t be here. I shouldn’t be here. Maybe JD or somebody else would be here, but I shouldn’t be here right now. But something very special happened. Let’s face it. Something happened. I want to thank Butler Memorial Hospital in Pennsylvania for the incredible job they did and service they gave and all of the great citizens of Butler, Pennsylvania and the surrounding area and everyone else for the job they did, and the love that they showed us all. It was incredible actually. What a time that was. What a time that was.
(08:37)
Nobody has seen anything like it, and hopefully they never will again. And they had cameras blazing. I guess it was different in that way too, because we were right in the middle. See, look at all the news back there, and they were all blazing. They were going. No. They covered it fairly. They couldn’t believe what they were seeing either. So they did. You did cover it fairly.
(09:02)
Let me also thank Congressman Ronny Jackson from Texas. You know Congressman Ronny Jackson for the care and treatment he gave me as an outstanding doctor, which he is. He’s really an amazing guy. Where’s Ronny? Doc Ronny is here someplace.
(09:23)
Thank you, Ronny. Thank you very much. Great doctor. He was a great admiral, a great doctor. He is a White House doctor for Bush, Obama and a guy named Trump, and they said, “Who was the healthiest of the three?” He said, “Not even a question, Trump.” And I said, “I love that guy. I love that guy.” When he said that, that was my doctor. Even if he’s a congressman, that was my doctor. But he’s been a great congressman. Thank you very much, Ronny, for everything. We appreciate it. Ronny Jackson.
(10:03)
We continue to pray for the recovery of the two citizens who were wounded in that evil attack. David Dutch and James Copenhaver. Two really incredible people. We remain in contact and send our deepest respect to the families. Corey, as you know, Corey Comperatore was a brave firefighter who died. Funeral yesterday, shielding his wife and daughters from bullets who shielded them from the bullets of this horrendous person. Corey was a hero and we will carry his memory in our hearts for all time. Great hero.

Audience (10:42):

Corey, Corey, Corey, Corey, Corey, Corey, Corey.

Donald Trump (10:42):

That’s great.

Audience (10:42):

Corey, Corey, Corey, Corey.

Donald Trump (10:56):

He was a big Trumper, and we will never forget him, right? We’re all together. We’re all together. There’s never been anything like what you witnessed the other day with the convention. I don’t think there’s ever been a convention where there was such unity and love and even the… Now, I’ll say just for a second, the fake news even said it that way. I want to be nice. But the fake news reported it correctly. There’s never been such unity and everybody did a great job and the speeches and everything. It was just an incredible event. I’ll tell you what, Milwaukee was a fantastic place. This was a beautiful arena, and they did a really great job. Wisconsin is going to vote for us because we spent $250 million. When they go into the voting booth, they’re going to say, “We love this guy. Trump, he gave us 250 million with jobs, and they’re going to vote.” Wisconsin a very important state as we know. But they really did. Wisconsin did a great job. Milwaukee, they did a great job, and the arena was fantastic. And it was just love. It was like a big, beautiful four-day love fest. There was no fight. It was no fight, no screams, no shouting, no get-that-guy-off-the-platform. And in case we had the Hulkster with us, right? How good was he?
(12:24)
How good was the Hulkster? And Kid Rock called? He said, “I want to get…” Kid Rock is big and he wanted to get down and he did an unbelievable job. He was great. But all of them, everybody, we had so many great people there. It was really an amazing thing to see and it was really something. I don’t think there’s ever been a lot of people report. I think it was either party. There’s never been anything like it. And now we have something coming up where they’re going to go for the convention and they have a couple of problems.
(12:59)
Number one, they have no idea who the candidate is and neither do we. That’s a problem, but we’ll see. Hopefully they get it worked out. Sort of interesting. This guy goes and he gets the votes, and now they want to take it away. That’s democracy. They talk about democracy. Let’s take it away from them. But now we go forward as one movement, and really we’re doing a very… We have a very special group of people like the people here. You people built this country.
(13:28)
It’s one movement, and we’re more united, determined than ever before. We’ve never been so determined. Bad things happened last time. We’re not going to let them happen this time. Bad, bad things happen. We will never stop working to deliver a magnificent future for our people, and together we will fight, fight, fight, right? And we will win, win, win. Right.

Audience (13:57):

Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.

Donald Trump (14:02):

Thank you.

Audience (14:02):

Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.

Donald Trump (14:09):

I like this place. You ever walk in to a place and you say, “I sort of like this place”? Less than four months from now, we are going to win Michigan. We are going to take back the White House with a monumental landslide. And with your help, we are going to make America great again. Right?
(14:41)
At our convention on just a little while ago in Milwaukee and Thursday, it was my tremendous honor to officially accept the Republican nomination for president of the United States. And I used to say it in 2016, and I meant it a hundred percent, but I made it even more now because this country has gone wrong. We’re a failing nation. We’re a left at failing nation right now. This will be the most important election in the history of our country. This is going to be the most important election. We cannot let it slip by. We cannot let people cheat. We cannot let this slip by or we’re not going to have a country.
(15:24)
Because I do have other things I could be doing. It would be a lot easier. Although I’d rather be with you than sitting on some gorgeous beach watching boring waves coming in. No, I would rather be. Actually, I would. You know what. I think that’s one of the reasons we’ve been so successful together. You know I mean that too to, but we’re going to make our country more successful than ever before. Yet even as we gather this evening, we will… And take a look still the Democratic nominee. We are going to find out shortly maybe. I don’t know.
(16:02)
Let’s do this. Let’s do a poll. I love doing polls, right? I do a poll. I do lots of polls. Do you like make America great again or do you like America first or do you like them both? I like them both. Right?

Audience (16:16):

[inaudible 00:16:18]

Donald Trump (16:19):

Let’s do a poll on candidates. Ready?

Audience (16:20):

[inaudible 00:16:22]

Donald Trump (16:21):

So I’ll go, I’ll go. We’re going to do a poll in a few candidates. The press will like this because they won’t have to pay for the poll. You do these crazy polls and they charge you 250…. Look, there’s Mr. Wall. This guy is the greatest guy. This guy. He must have a lot of money because he’s at so many different rallies. He was at the one… That was a tough one, wasn’t it? That was something. You were right up in the front. You saw that. That was something. We’re going to do a poll, and it’s going to be a very nice poll.
(16:57)
Who’s your favorite candidate? Who would you like? Let’s do it. Who would you most like to run against? Because you could say, “Who’s the best candidate?” We’re saying, “Who would you like to…” We’ll start with Kamala Harris and then we’ll go and then we’ll go to Crooked Joe Biden. And then we could possibly discuss a few. So who would you like to most run against if you’re us, if we want to win? Ready? Kamala Harris? Crooked Joe Biden? All right. I don’t think we have to go too much further.
(17:44)
Well, you have a terrible governor here who did a terrible job. I’d like to run against her actually. I’d like to run against her. She’s one of the 20 that I mentioned. She’s the one that gave her husband full right title and interest to everything, but nobody else could do anything but her husband. Her husband was sailing in the middle of your lake, your beautiful lake. He’s out there sailing and everybody else had to be locked up, right? Her husband.
(18:17)
No, but things like that are mentioned during a campaign. Little things like that. No, she’s done a terrible job, but I hope… I’d be very happy with her. At this very moment, Democrat party bosses are frantically trying to overthrow the results of their own party’s primaries to dump Crooked Joe Biden from the ballot. Couldn’t happen to a nicer guy.
(18:40)
And as you’re seeing, the Democrat Party is not the party of democracy. They’re really the enemies of democracy. The parties of corrupt insiders like Whitmer’s, special interests, and the failed political class. That’s what they are. Under our leadership.,The Republican Party is now the party of the people. We’re the party of hardworking Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. We’ve become a very big party.
(19:10)
We become… Right, fellas? You know what I’m talking about. I love you guys. We love you guys. No, we become a very big party. We have increased in size. Nobody’s ever… Honestly, in history, there’s never been anything like this movement. And that may be in the history of the world, but let’s keep it down to the country for right now, because that’s the thing. But there’s never been anything like MAGA. When Biden says, “We have to stop MAGA, we will stop MAGA,” I said, “He doesn’t know what MAGA stands for. It stands for Make America Great Again.”

Audience (19:47):

Make America Great Again.

Donald Trump (19:48):

How can you be against that? How can you be against that? And the other side is going around trying to make me sound extreme like I’m an extremist. I’m not. I’m a person with great common sense. I’m not an extremist at all. Some on the right, severe right came up with this Project 25, and I don’t even know. I mean some of them, I know who they are, but they’re very, very conservative. Just like you have… They’re sort of the opposite of the radical left. You have the radical left and you have the radical right, and they come up with this… I don’t know what the hell it is. It’s Project 25. “He’s involved in Project…” And then they read some of the things, and they are extreme.
(20:37)
I mean, they’re seriously extreme, but I don’t know anything about it. I don’t want to know anything about it. But what they do is misinformation and disinformation. They keep saying, “He’s a threat to democracy.” I’m saying, “What the hell did I do for democracy?” Last week, I took a bullet for democracy. What did I do against democracy? Crazy.
(20:57)
Hello, Chris. Here’s our great campaign, man. Chris, are you having a good time? Look at him. He is back there. Cool as a cucumber. So far, they’re giving us great credit for the best-run campaign they’ve seen in years. Isn’t that nice? Thank you, Susie. Thank you, Chris. Look how cool he is. Just sits there. Thanks. Try doing it with another candidate sometime. That gets tough, right? Anyway, thank you very much. Great job, Chris, Susie, the whole group. We have a great group of people. They love this country. They want to save the country. That’s what we’re doing. With your vote in this election, the Trump-Vance administration.
(21:53)
By the way, I made the right pick. He’s so good. They were all good. They were all good, but he’s really stepped up. But the Trump-Vance administration will begin rapidly reversing every single Biden-Harris disaster starting on day one. When you vote for Biden, you’re probably voting indirectly for Harris anyway, whether you’d like it or not. It’s common sense. It’s all common sense, right? We will end the inflation nightmare that you would’ve never had. We had no inflation.
(22:29)
See, there’s another thing. Biden always goes around, “I inherited 9% inflation.” And even the radical left reporters up there. Look at all of them. Whoa, they have a lot. They have a lot of them. They have a lot of them. Look at those cameras. But they’ll start turning off as soon as I start mentioning certain things. I’ll say, “The red light just went off.”
(22:52)
No, but actually the radical left reporters of which there are quite a few, I can’t believe it. I don’t know why they’d have them, but the radical left reporters say the guys wrote, “Wasn’t it until two years in that we became destroyed with inflation?” Inflation is a country buster. It’s a class buster. It busts everything. Low-income, middle-income especially, and they get bust. They’re busted. The country gets busted.
(23:21)
Look at Germany from centuries ago. Look at every country that’s had inflation. And we had, I believe, the greatest inflation in the history of our country. They don’t even report it properly because they leave the worst numbers out. They don’t talk about interest rates that went to 10, 11, 12% and you can’t get the money. So what does that mean, 12%, if you can’t get the money. It means it’s higher.
(23:43)
From 2%, we will seal the border and we will stop this terrible invasion that’s destroying our country. We’ll crush migrant crime. We’re going to crush migrant crime. Oh, we have a new form of crime now. It’s called migrant crime. The only good thing about these migrants coming in is they make our gang members and criminals look like the nicest people you’ve ever met. These people are much tougher. They come from all over the world, not just from South America. We’re going to return law and order to our streets and restore patriotism to our schools.
(24:28)
We gave you already the largest tax cut in the history of our country, larger than the Reagan cuts, but now we will give you an additional tax cut, a number of tax cuts that will make it. We took in more money after the tax cuts that we did prior. We took in billions and billions of dollars more after the tax cuts that we did. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. Everyone knows that.
(24:53)
We’re going to slash regulations. That’s what created all of those jobs and gave them bounce-back jobs. They’re called bounce-back jobs. After COVID, they bounce back. Everybody knows that when you have something like COVID, which rarely happens, but when you have something like that, they’re called bounce-back jobs. And we’re going to bring down energy prices very rapidly. It was energy that caused the problem and their stupidity. We’re going to bring it down very quickly.
(25:17)
Your energy bills will be cut in half, at least in cut in half. Some sections like in New England, I’ll be able to cut their energy by 60, 70%. It’s absolutely crazy what has happened with energy. We buy the oil from Venezuela. They used to be our enemy. I don’t know. We buy from Venezuela. It’s not really oil. It’s tar. And there’s only one refinery in the world that can do it. It’s very heavy, horrible stuff. It’s garbage. It’s tar. You lift it.
(25:50)
I said, “That’s not oil. We want light, sweet, crude.” We have the best oil. We have the best everything. We go to Venezuela. You know where they refine it? In Houston, Texas. It’s the only plant in the world that can refine that stuff. So we go to Venezuela. We pay them a fortune. We take that dictatorship. We make the dictatorship wealthy. These people don’t know what the hell they’re doing. They’re incompetent. They’re grossly incompetent. The biggest threat is because we have incompetent… That’s the threat to democracy. It’s a threat to our country. We have incompetent people leading our country. Grossly incompetent people.
(26:27)
America’s enemies will fear us. The United States will again command the respect that it deserves. Viktor Orban, the very powerful leader of Hungary said when asked, “What happened with the world that’s falling to pieces? There are wars all over.” He said, “Bring back Trump. It’ll all end. It all ended. We had no problem in the war.” And something beautiful is going to happen because we will bring back the American dream. And it’ll be bigger, better, and bolder than ever before.
(27:08)
Most importantly for the people of this great state, years ago, they gave me in Michigan, the man of the year. That was long before I was a politician. I was a business guy. I did well. I liked the state, but I don’t know. I heard a man of the year Michigan. I said, “That’s cool. That’s good. I’m going to make that trip.” I didn’t know why they were giving it to me, nothing, but they were giving it to me for, I guess, the fact that I employed a lot of people. I did real well.
(27:34)
This is probably 14 years ago. I came in and I said, “Why do you allow foreign countries like Mexico…” Mexico, we think of them as friendly, but they haven’t been too friendly lately. How about where they asked Biden to meet. Just to meet. They want $2 billion to meet. They wouldn’t ask that. See, they wouldn’t even ask me that because I’d say, “I will put 100% tariffs on everything you send into a country if you even think about asking.” They want $2 billion to meet. In other words, “We won’t meet with you unless you pay us $2 billion.”
(28:08)
And this is every single year they want $2 billion. It works the opposite of that. The exact opposite. But when you see the things that are happening to our country and all you have to do is know how to speak. When I watched the way our border was handled, we had the best border, the safest border, the border that saved my life. I was pointing to an immigration border signed when I made this turn, and that thing went that way instead of that way. So I owe immigration my life. It’s true. It’s true.
(28:54)
Now, think about it. I’m talking thousands and thousands, much more than even this. I mean, we’re restricted because you’re in this giant arena. That’s the one thing about outdoor. That’s good. You can have unlimited thousands and thousands as far as the eye can see. Nobody is over here or over here because there’s nobody there. It starts like this as far as the eye can see, and I said, “Look at the great results that we had on immigration. Just look at that.” Ping. If I didn’t say that…. And it’s because we had like a crane holding this massive sign. I call it the million dollar sign. They’re expensive. But that sign was very good. I think I’m going to sleep with it tonight. I’m going to sleep with it tonight.
(29:42)
I said, “What was that? What was that?” I looked, I said, “That’s not good. That’s not good.” So immigration, if you think about it, right? Immigration. I would’ve never been looking to the right, and I had to be. It was the only place that would’ve saved

Donald Trump (30:01):

They do these reports in The New York Times and all over the place where they had the shape, if he turns this way, this way, this way, if every shot was no good for me except for the one direct, direct and came whizzing by. I hope we have to never go through that again, everybody, because it’s so horrible, horrible.

Audience (30:24):

[inaudible 00:30:26].

Donald Trump (30:27):

But most importantly, for the people of your state, this great state, I will rescue the US auto industry from obliteration. They’re going to obliterate your auto industry. Anybody that votes for the head of the United Auto Workers, this guy doesn’t know what he’s doing. He’s approved all electric cars.

Audience (30:48):

[inaudible 00:30:48].
(30:48)
Boo.

Donald Trump (30:49):

Elon, I love Elon Musk. Do we love him? I love him. I’m constantly talking about electric cars, but I don’t mean I’m against … I’m totally for them, but whatever the market says. If it’s 10% of the market, 12%, 7%, 20%, whatever it is, it’s okay, but you can’t have 100% electric cars.
(31:11)
So Elon endorsed me recently the other day, actually. He’s great, Elon Musk. He’s a brilliant guy. Every time I call him, he’s talking about, “I got a new idea for a rocket. You have to hear this.” No, it’s true.
(31:28)
The first time I ever saw this, I’m watching television like three years ago, and I see a rocket engine, motor engine, come down landing straight up into … No wings, no nothing, and it’s landing. I thought I was seeing things. What is that? It’s landing on a barge in the middle of the ocean. Then another one comes down, and another one, another one. I guess four of them came down, three or four, and they land upright. I said, “What the hell was that? I’ve never seen that before.” Now if that were government, you wouldn’t see that for another 50 to 100 years. But it was Elon.
(32:08)
Now think of that. I called him … And I’ve always had a good relationship with him. But I called him and I said, “What was that?” He said, “Well, we saved the engines. We saved the engines because it’s very expensive to build.” I mean it didn’t take me long to figure that if you save them, that’s good. But who the hell thought you could do that? No wings, no nothing. Just like these big, long, massive tubes. They’re landing gently right on the dot.
(32:33)
I said, “That’s the coolest thing I’ve ever seen.” And you say, how long would it take government to come up with that one? I don’t think they ever heard of it. Perhaps they still haven’t heard of it. But he’s a very advanced person and he’s doing other things that are great and so or other. We have to make life good for our smart people. We have some smart people. We have to make life good for our smart people, and he’s as smart as you get.
(32:59)
But Elon endorsed me the other day and I read … I didn’t even know this, he didn’t even tell me about it, but he gives me $45 million a month. A month. Not 45 million. He gives me $45 million a month.
(33:24)
I talked to him just a little while ago to say I was coming here, “How’re you doing?” and he didn’t even mention it. He didn’t mention … I mean other guys, they give you $2 and you’ve got to take them to lunch. You’ve got to wine them, dine them. No, he’s a great guy. He really is. But he’s never mentioned to me, “Why are you hitting the electric cars?” because he understands I’m not hitting it. I think it’s incredible. I’ve had them, I’ve driven them. They’re incredible. But they’re not for everybody. Some people have to drive long distances.
(33:56)
And they tend to be more expensive. They’ll probably be made in China because China has all of that material. Oh, there’s the guy that I stood up here. Are you the same guy? The same muscles? Look at that guy. Are you the same guy? Yes? No kidding. It’s pretty good memory, right? Unlike somebody else that happened to be running again. He wouldn’t … Come on. Come on up here. Get up here. I’ve got to get this guy. This guy was central casting. Look at him. Look. Oh, I think he was standing on a box. That was the only thing. I said you’ve got … Come on up here. Don’t hurt yourself. Can you get him up? I like this guy. He’s a serious union guy. A United Auto Workers. Look at him get over there. It’s okay. He does not carry guns. He’s not … Come on up here. Look at him. Look at the shape he’s in.

Speaker 2 (35:01):

I’m glad to see you.

Donald Trump (35:01):

[inaudible 00:35:02].

Speaker 2 (35:01):

I’m glad to see you.

Donald Trump (35:01):

Come on, say it yourself here. That’s okay.

Speaker 2 (35:01):

I’m glad to see this guy. I told you we’re going to get 85 million of us out there to vote for him. So let’s go home from this rally and do our part.

Donald Trump (35:20):

[inaudible 00:35:15]. Look at the arms on him. I may have height, but his arms are definitely more powerful, huh? Look at that guy. No, last time I was here, I saw him and he was so great. He was agreeing with us on auto. We want to bring car manufacturing back and what the deal with this thing with the all electric cars by … In six years from now? It’s ridiculous.
(35:45)
In the Midwest, they opened up chargers. They opened up eight chargers. You read about this. $9 billion they spent for eight chargers. That’s like a gas pump. I guess it would be like the equivalent of a gas pump for electric. They spent $9 billion on eight charges. This is eight little chargers, $9 billion. How do you do that? It would cost at that rate $5 trillion to create enough charges so it could run.
(36:15)
It doesn’t work and it doesn’t work on the trucks either. I was with Swift, big Swift company. “How many trucks do you own?” “29,000, sir.” 29,000? That’s a lot of trucks. One of the biggest. I guess, the biggest.

Audience (36:26):

[inaudible 00:36:27].

Donald Trump (36:27):

I think he’s the biggest. He said, “They want to destroy our business. They want us to go all electric.” I said, “So what’s wrong with electric?” I said, “If you take a big, beautiful Peterbilt or one of the great manufacturers, how many times would you have to stop from New York to Los Angeles?” “None, sir. We go right there. We have something left over. That’s with diesel.” I said, “What about if it’s electric?” “We have six to seven stops, about three hours each.”
(36:55)
So immediately he’s saying that’s not working too well. He said, “But there are other problems.” He said, ” The truck is so much heavier that you’d have to rebuild every bridge in the country.” That doesn’t sound too good.
(37:06)
Then the third thing he said, that the battery is so much bigger than a tank, a big tank, for the diesel or for the gasoline, but the diesel mostly. It’s so much bigger that most of our payload would be holding batteries. In other words, we wouldn’t have any room for the product.
(37:22)
So let’s say you hear those three minor details. Typically you would end the conversation, would say, “That doesn’t work.” These people say, “We don’t care. We want you to go all electric.” Can you believe these people? They’re crazy.

Audience (37:39):

Boo.

Donald Trump (37:39):

They’re crazy. No, they’re crazy. And they want boats to do the same thing. I was with, in South Carolina, one of the biggest boat manufacturers of smaller fishing boats from, let’s say, 16 to 35 feet. He said, “We have a problem. They keep pushing the beautiful outboard engines. You have Mercury and Evan Rude. I guess they used to have … I don’t know if they have it anymore, but those big beautiful outboard engines they have, they work great, or just interior engines run by a thing called gasoline.
(38:12)
So he said, “They want us to figure out how to go all electric in a boat. All electric.” I said, “Well, what is the problem?” He said, “We’d have to take the entire lower cabin where we have bedrooms and we’d have to make that into a battery. But the bigger problem is, sir, it won’t float because it’s so heavy. It won’t float. It won’t float.”

Audience (38:37):

[inaudible 00:38:38].

Donald Trump (38:38):

I always tell the story with like, well, what would you do? Because my uncle was a great professor at MIT for 41 years. I think he’s the longest serving … Dr. John Trump. She knows. He was very, very smart. We have a very smart family, actually. But he was a great guy. I always thought … I was very interested in this, but the press kills me all the time. They say, “He keeps talking about sharks and this.” I don’t. I tell an analogy. If I’m in a boat, it’s all electric and it starts to sink. I asked the guy-

Audience (39:10):

[inaudible 00:39:11].

Donald Trump (39:11):

… “Do you get electrocuted sitting over this?” and then I say … And I don’t think there’s anything wrong with this, do you? Because it’s an analogy, I say … And if there’s a shark about 10 yards away, right where they are, right where all the congressmen are right over there, look at us, well, they’re sharks. They’re sharks. If there’s a shark about 10 yards away-

Audience (39:36):

We love [inaudible 00:39:37].

Donald Trump (39:37):

… do I get electrocuted or do I go with the shark? I said because I will take electrocution all day long despite the environmentalists that say how wonderful sharks are. You ever hear these people? We had three killings by a shark this week and rip people apart, and then you have the environmentalists going, “Well, they didn’t mean to do it. They really … They mistook them for a seal. They didn’t want to hurt the child.” No, I don’t want that. Commonsense, right? I mean how about they catch a shark, vicious, that they’ve been after and they take him to a little deeper water and they put him back in? I wouldn’t do that.
(40:16)
Would anybody do that here? Let me ask you. This is Michigan. These guys wouldn’t do it, but they always get on me. They say, “Why is he talking about electricity and sharks? What do they … ” Well, they know exactly. It’s sort of a cute little story. Do I take electrocution or do I take death by a shark?

Audience (40:32):

Shark.

Donald Trump (40:34):

I’ll always take electrocution. But isn’t it ridiculous? Think of it. Isn’t it ridiculous? They want to make a boat that’s far too heavy, that can barely float, and they’re driving people out of business. They’re destroying this country. They’re stupidly destroying this country. The army tanks are the other one. They want to make all electric. We make the best tanks in the world. They want to have a-

Audience (40:55):

Boo.

Donald Trump (40:56):

So that as we go into a country to bomb the hell out of it, we will do it in an environmentally friendly way [inaudible 00:41:05]. With an army tank, again, the battery’s very big, very heavy, and doesn’t last long. You know what it is? It’s an army tank and it’s like you’re pulling a wagon behind the army tank. You’re pulling a wagon like a child pulls a wagon, and it’s loaded up with a battery.

Audience (41:21):

[inaudible 00:41:22].

Donald Trump (41:22):

So we got to get back to commonsense. The aircraft, too. They want to make our jet fighters a biofuel jet fighter that shows 18% less efficiency. That’s the difference between winning and losing a fight. You know what happens? I say I’m not doing it. We ended all of that stuff. They brought it back. We will end it on day one. We’re not going to be doing that stuff.
(41:49)
In four short years, under my leadership, I did more for Michigan autoworkers and manufacturers than any president in the history of our country. Just as I promised, I withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would’ve totally destroyed your auto industry. I ended the disaster known as NAFTA. That was the worst trade deal ever made. That was the worst trade deal considered by them. That was so unfair to us with Mexico and Canada. The worst trade deal ever made, and replaced it with what they call the best trade deal ever made, the USMCA, Mexico and Canada.
(42:31)
I know it’s good because Mexico and Canada are right now, as we speak, working like hell to try and renegotiate the deal. Don’t do it, Biden. Well, he doesn’t know what’s going on. Don’t do it. He’s watching us now. He’ll say, “What’s that trade deal they’re talking about?” “Well, so they’ve been negotiating with us for about two years.” “I never heard of that negotiation. Where is Mexico anyway? Where is it?”
(42:59)
See, now the fake news will take the statement I just say, “Where is Mexico?” and they’ll put it on television. “Trump didn’t know where Mexico is.” Oh, they do. They do. It’s very dangerous. The biggest threat I have to my administration is sarcasm because they play it against me. When I show that he can’t walk off … He can never find the entrances off a stage. Look, one here, one there, two here. He could jump off the front, I guess.
(43:31)
Whenever I imitate him … I called my wife. She’s great. She’s great, our great first lady. I said [inaudible 00:43:41]. She looked great the other night. She made that entrance. She made a lot of entrances. She’s just something. But she walked in. But I told her the other night, I said, “How good was I? How good?” This was at a rally a couple of weeks ago. “How good was I?” “Well, you were really good, but not great.” “Why?”

Audience (43:59):

[inaudible 00:44:00].

Donald Trump (44:00):

” Well, it showed that you didn’t know how to get off the stage.” Well, I was imitating Biden. So what they do is they show the imitation of Biden. They said, “Trump didn’t know how to get off the stage.” That’s our fake news.

Audience (44:14):

Boo.

Donald Trump (44:15):

So we have to be very careful. So I haven’t done it in about three weeks. I’ll do it again, but maybe not right now. It’s toose. “Darling, you were great.”

Audience (44:23):

Do it.

Donald Trump (44:25):

I mean I get these crowds, 50, 60, 70,000. In New Jersey, we had … We’re leading New Jersey by four points, by the way.

Audience (44:36):

Whoo.

Donald Trump (44:36):

We’re leading Michigan by six points. A report just came out. Actually, we’re leading everywhere and nationally and that we have to keep it that way. Got to make sure they don’t cheat. Got to make sure they don’t cheat.
(45:02)
I took on China like no administration in history, bringing hundreds of billions of dollars pouring into our Treasury when no other president had gotten 10 cents. China never gave us 10 cents. I got hundreds of billions of dollars from China, and I got along very well with President Xi.
(45:22)
He’s a great guy, wrote me a beautiful note the other day when he heard about what happened. He wrote me a beautiful … Most of the leaders do. A lot of them didn’t like what I was doing to them, but they also knew it was about time. The jig was up, right?

Audience (45:36):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (45:36):

It was about time. But they wrote me. Almost all of them wrote me notes. It was nice. Now I have a good relationship with all of them. That’s a good thing. A lot of times the press would say, “He gets along with Kim Jong Un, North Korea.” He has a lot of nuclear weapons. I got along with him great. You are never in danger with me as your president. It’s a good thing to get along. Not a bad thing.
(45:59)
I used to tell him, “Why don’t you do something else?” All he wants to do is buy nuclear weapons and make them. I said, “Just relax. Chill. You got enough. You got … ” He got so much nuclear weapons.

Audience (46:10):

[inaudible 00:46:11].

Donald Trump (46:10):

So much. I said, “Just relax. Go to a nice … Let’s go to a baseball game. I’ll show you what a baseball … We’ll go watch the Yankees,” or we’ll come watch Michigan at its home opener.

Audience (46:27):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (46:28):

How about that? Are you going to have a good team this year? I think, right?

Audience (46:31):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (46:31):

Pretty good. I heard good.

Audience (46:32):

Thank you.

Donald Trump (46:33):

I heard good, but who the hell knows, right?

Audience (46:34):

[inaudible 00:46:36].

Donald Trump (46:35):

Guy drops a pass. That’s the end of that season. It’s a risky business. I proudly imposed a 27.5 tariff on all Chinese auto imports to keep China and Chinese cars, keep them out of America. You don’t sell a lot of Chinese cars in here because of what … And if you did, it’d be fewer cars that you made. We’re going to bring back the auto industry because of-

Audience (46:59):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (47:00):

We’re going to bring it back. We’re going to have them. If they want to come in and sell us cars, they can, but they have to build plants here and they have to hire our workers, and that’s fine. Nobody can say anything about it.
(47:11)
Under the radical Democrat policies, the US auto industry is being decimated. We lost 64% of our industry over the years. 64%. We were a giant. And now a lot of them are made in Mexico. Mexico has taken 35% of the auto industry.
(47:29)
We did something very strong. We did something very strong with Mexico. But when I was building the wall, I said, “You have to give us 28,000 soldiers,” and they laughed at me.

Audience (47:40):

[inaudible 00:47:41].

Donald Trump (47:41):

I hate when people laugh at me. I hate it. I hate it.

Audience (47:44):

[inaudible 00:47:45].

Donald Trump (47:45):

It was so disrespectful. They laughed at me. “We won’t do that. Why would we do that?” I said, “Because you have to. We’re building the wall. People are flowing in through your country. We want 28,000 soldiers to protect us while we’re building the wall.”

Audience (47:57):

[inaudible 00:47:58].

Donald Trump (47:57):

They said, “No, no, no.” Then they said … After I said, “Look, here’s a story. If you don’t do it, we’re going to charge you a 25% tariff on every car that you send into America.”

Audience (48:09):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (48:12):

Then it’s going to 50% next month, then it’s going to 75%, and then it’s going to 100%, and then I’ll stop. The gentleman representing the president … The president’s a great guy. He’s no longer president, but he’s a great guy. He was a great guy, still is. But he said, ” I’d like to discuss this with the president.” I said, “Five minutes. I’ve got to go. I have something much more important to do.”
(48:37)
He came back, he said, “Mr. President, we would love to give you soldiers to protect you all. Free of charge, of course.” That’s how I got those great numbers on that beautiful, beautiful graph that we talked about. They gave us everything I wanted. I got everything from Mexico, and then this stupid person, low IQ … He’s a low IQ individual. Take his IQ. I guarantee you it’s in the low 50s or 60s. And he’s negotiating against Putin, President Xi of China, Macron of France. Very smart guy.
(49:13)
I told him he was going to do something very bad to our country. I said, “That’s okay. You can do it, but I’m going to put a 100% tariff on all wines and champagnes that come in from France.” He said, “No, no, no, Donald, you cannot do that.” I said, “I’m doing it.” “Donald, you cannot do that. That’s not fair.” He’s going to charge our companies, American companies, 25% for doing nothing, for being in France. Big deal, right? Big deal.
(49:38)
So I said, “Okay. That’s all right. I’m charging you 100% tariff.” I gave it to all my people, minutiae. They’re all smart guys. They came back, “Sir, they won’t do it. They won’t budge.” I said, “They’ll budge.” I called them up and I talked to the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, who’s a nice guy. I said … But he likes France. I like the USA. Does that make sense?
(49:58)
I said, “Emmanuel, it’s so nice to talk to you. I understand you’re going to charge our companies 25%, Emmanuel.” “Yes, yes, yes, Donald. It was approved by … ,” whoever the hell approves the parliament. Whatever the hell they have over there, they were going to approve it. It’s been fully approved. “Yes. I’m so sorry.” I said, “Well, that’s okay. You can have it approved. But here’s a story. Starting tomorrow morning at 7:00, every bottle of wine and every bottle of champagne that’s shipped into the United States is going to have a 100% tariff on it.”
(50:30)
“No, no, no. You cannot do that. That is not fair.” I said, “It’s not fair for you to charge our companies 25%.” He said, “You cannot do it.” I said, “I’m signing the papers now. I will call you right back.”
(50:41)
He calls me back. “Donald, we would be delighted, Mr. President, to take that tax off. We have decided to take it off. It will be off by tonight, sir. It’ll be off by tonight,” and it was off. And it was off. You think Joe Biden does that?

Audience (51:02):

No.

Donald Trump (51:04):

He doesn’t know what the hell he’s doing.

Audience (51:05):

[inaudible 00:51:09].

Donald Trump (51:10):

Their policies are no good. Remember, whether it’s Biden or anybody else, they want open borders. They want all the same stuff. So it’s like … But, in particular, he’s pretty bad, I tell you.

Audience (51:19):

[inaudible 00:51:20].

Donald Trump (51:20):

Can you imagine? These killers, these killers, these are sharp. The press gets angry. They said, “Is President Xi of China, is he a smart man?” I said, “No, he’s a brilliant man. He controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist. He makes guys like Biden look like babies. They don’t even know whether they’re coming or going. Yes, he’s … ”
(51:43)
The next day headlines, “Trump calls him brilliant. How dare … ” No, no. Okay. Let’s say he’s not a smart man. Whatever makes you happy. No matter what you do, I say he’s a brilliant man. They went crazy because I called him brilliant. So I’m just going to have to say he’s okay. He’s okay. No, he’s very smart.

Audience (52:01):

[inaudible 00:52:02].

Donald Trump (52:02):

You know what else? He’s a fierce person. Do you understand that? Some of the people here know that, what this means, especially some of the women. They know better than the men about fierce. I know the women. They know better than the men. They’re more fierce than the men. Oh, her. Her.
(52:21)
But, no, he’s a fierce individual. He’s a fierce man. Can you imagine when he meets this guy? He thinks Trump is playing a joke on him. He actually thinks that I’m playing a joke. He doesn’t believe what happened. He doesn’t believe the last election. He doesn’t believe … He thinks I’m playing a joke in him.
(52:39)
But can you imagine President Xi, Putin, all of them? They’re all smart, tough. They love their country or they want to do well with their country, whatever it is, all ideology. But we have to have somebody that can protect us. Orban was right. We have to have somebody that can protect us. Right now we have really low IQ people in there. The president in particular, he has about a 70 IQ and he’s going against 210. It never works out. It never works out. When I’m back in the White House …

Audience (53:18):

Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump.
(53:18)
[inaudible 00:53:42].

Donald Trump (53:49):

When I’m back in the White House, the way they will sell their product in America is to build it in America. They have to build it in America and they have to use you people to build it. Thank you very much. It’s very simple.
(54:07)
We will build American by American. We’re going to hire American. We’re going to get it going. We’re going to get the auto industry back. It’s ridiculous.

Audience (54:14):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (54:17):

I will revoke China’s most favored nations trade … You know, they have a most favored nations trade status. They’ve had it for years. We had it revoked, and then we had that stupid election, that ridiculous election, that everybody knows was ridiculous.

Audience (54:30):

[inaudible 00:54:31].

Donald Trump (54:31):

But I will revoke it. They have a trade.

Audience (54:33):

[inaudible 00:54:34].

Donald Trump (54:34):

Basically, they’re saying, “We’re just beginning.” They’re not just beginning. They’re teaching our people too much. I will pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act, meaning if China charges us a 100 or 200% tariff or tax, we will charge them a 200% tax. Very simple. It’s called reciprocal. They charge, we charge. It sort of says … I shouldn’t say this because Franklin Graham … I told the story the other night, Franklin Graham, he’s such a wonderful guy. Billy Graham was his father, the greatest. My father used to take me to Yankees Stadium to watch Billy Graham. The place was packed. He would get up and he would rant and rave, and you left there and you believed that it was God, in fact, that helped me last week. You would believe it if you listened to Billy Graham.

Audience (55:26):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (55:26):

Franklin Graham is right, probably. But he wrote me a beautiful letter. He says, “President Trump, I watch your speeches and your rallies all the time. I love your storytelling. There’s nobody that can do it like you. But, please, you’re hurting yourself very badly. Don’t use foul language.”

Audience (55:46):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (55:46):

It made me feel bad, actually, because I don’t use much. I don’t use much. If it is foul, it’s not really foul. There’s really foul and there’s foul and then there’s a little off. Like some people, they don’t like the word hell. That’s a bad word. I mean that’s not good, or the word bullshit they don’t like, so I won’t use it. No, it’s true. But it’s more descriptive. There’s just no word to sort of-

Audience (56:11):

[inaudible 00:56:12].

Donald Trump (56:13):

But he said, “So please.” So I’ve been really good, and for the last four or five times, I’ve really been good. But you lose a little something.
(56:21)
But reciprocal trade, it basically means you screw us and we’ll screw you. It’s very simple. I can’t describe it. I don’t think it’s foul-

Audience (56:32):

USA. USA. USA. USA.

Donald Trump (56:34):

… but he’s probably right. To further protect Michigan auto workers, I will end the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate on day one. It’s going to end on day one. I will immediately terminate the green new scam and we’re going to use that money to bill roads and highways and bridges.
(56:59)
Under Biden and the radical left Democrats, inflation is wiping out our middle class. Groceries are up 57%. Gasoline is up 69%. Mortgage rates have quadrupled. They’ve gone up-

Audience (57:13):

Boo.

Donald Trump (57:13):

… three, four, five times, and they never include that in their stats. They never include those things. They never include mortgage rates.

Audience (57:21):

[inaudible 00:57:22].

Donald Trump (57:22):

You can’t get the money anyway. So what really is the number? Since Democrats took over, total household costs have increased by an average of $28,000 per family. Think of that.

Audience (57:34):

Boo.

Donald Trump (57:35):

Under my leadership, we will throw out Bidenomics and we will replace it very simply with-

Audience (57:40):

[inaudible 00:57:41].

Donald Trump (57:40):

… Maganomics. Maganomics.

Audience (57:40):

Yeah. MAGA, MAGA, MAGA, MAGA, MAGA, MAGA, MAGA, MAGA, MAGA, MAGA.

Donald Trump (58:06):

I have to just interject. If you would turn off those cameras, because I don’t want this … See the screen up there of me? That’s very severe that comb over. That’s a severe sucker. What’s with that one? It looks okay from the other side. But that is very severe. I apologize. Man. I looked up there, I said, “Whoa.” Look at that. Wow. That’s like a work of art. Only look at that one. Don’t look … That one looks …
(58:53)
To bring down the prices of all goods, we will end the Biden-Harris war on American energy and we will drill, baby, drill. We’re going to start that day one. Under the Trump administration, we had energy independence, and soon we will have energy-dominant. We will be more dominant than any country by far. And we were … Just four years ago, we started off at number four. We got to number three, and then we had to beat Russia. We beat them. Then we had to beat Saudi Arabia. We beat them. We were like a rocket ship. Then we had this idiotic result.

Audience (59:28):

[inaudible 00:59:30].

Donald Trump (59:30):

But we will be … And, again, we have more … ANWR in Alaska. It’s probably the biggest find anywhere in the world. The size of Saudi Arabia some people say. Who knows what it is, but it’s massive. Ronald Reagan tried to get it, couldn’t get it. That was easier in those days environmentally. They stop it with the environment … The environment is very important to me, and environmental is very important, but you can’t use it to destroy a country.
(59:54)
They stopped it. They stopped it for years based on the environment. I got it

Donald Trump (01:00:00):

… got approved, it was totally done. This is after since Ronald Reagan, who worked so hard to get Anwar. He wanted to be able to drill in Alaska. Think of it as the size of Saudi Arabia approximately bigger than Texas, bigger than everything, we would’ve had something that nobody else even comes close to. And on the first week in office, his department of the interior person who was just put in Department of Interior, she outlawed it. She said, “We’re not going to use it.” Stopped all work. They were ready to start drilling. It took them a while to get ready. They’re ready to start drilling. The money would’ve been incredible. The prices were very high. We’re the only country that stops drilling when the prices are at an all time high. And we stopped drilling, but we’ll get that back and I’ll get it back very fast. But Anwar, they cut it. Unbelievable.
(01:00:53)
And I will cut taxes even further than we did before. And that includes no tax on tips, right? No tax on tips. All the government does is harass everybody over it anyway. It’s like a big harassment operation. They hired 88,000 IRS people to go arrest everybody.

Audience (01:01:19):

Boo!

Donald Trump (01:01:21):

So if you work in a restaurant, if you drive a cab, or if you do anything having to do with tips, I hope you’re going to remember bartenders. Let’s see, hospitality workers, a caddy, a barber. Barbers get tips. I don’t give mine a big tip because I don’t think they do a very good job. If you’re a mover, a driver, or anyone else who relies on tips, the money is going to be 100% yours. You better go vote. If that doesn’t get you out, if that doesn’t get you off your ass to go out and vote for Trump, nothing will. Got to do it, right? Got to do it. And as we rescue our economy, I will also restore the sacred and sovereign borders of a place called the United States of America, right? United States of America.
(01:02:14)
With Democrats in charge, the greatest invasion in history is taking place right now. This is an invasion of our country. You remember during the time I was trying to get the wall and I was getting all sorts of assurances and you couldn’t get it from Congress. It was incredible. So I did get a lot of money for the military, so I put an extra 10 billion. I put a little fund, an extra 10 billion. I then called it an invasion of our country, and I took it out of the military and I got it built. And now we’re going to build it larger. We have to close up the areas that weren’t built. We have certain areas where we needed to have them open for a little while, for getting all of our stuff back. I don’t like leaving brand new bulldozers and everything on the other side of the border, right? We want to close it up, but we had certain areas we had to close up. And when they took over, they said, “We’re not going to close it.” I said, “These guys actually do.”
(01:03:06)
I thought they were kidding. I thought they were not being serious. Who would want an open border? Who would want an open border where people come in from prisons and jails and mental institution?

Audience (01:03:16):

[inaudible 01:03:18].

Donald Trump (01:03:18):

Either people that don’t love our country. Stupid people. They’re not stupid because anybody that can cheat that well on an elections. It’s not stupid. Or maybe a new thing’s emerging where they want to get people to vote illegally. And they don’t care. They have no shame. And we’re watching that. Our chairman is here, the Republican chairman is here, the whole thing. See, the big bosses is here in Michigan, so you’re going to remember that. But we’re working on that.
(01:03:48)
But they do. They’re trying to sign people up who just came in, who have no idea where they are, what they’re doing. They came in. And in many cases, they’re very rough people, but they came in, they’re trying to sign them up to vote. This is what they’ll do because think of it, if they have open borders, if they have men playing in women’s sports, they’re going to raise your taxes by four times. Four times. Think of it, what you’re paying now, you’re going to pay four times more. With policy like this, nobody can get elected. The only way you can get elected is to cheat, and they are really good at it.
(01:04:25)
That’s the only thing they’re good at. That’s the only thing they focus on. They have no good policies. They don’t do anything well. But they’re using these people and they’re trying to sign up the people. And we’ve caught them and we sue and we do all the things that you have to do, but they have no shame whatsoever. So that’s really one of the big reasons I think they’re allowing it because they’re not stupid enough to allow prisoners and people from mental institutions, people from insane asylums, and it drives them crazy.
(01:04:54)
Hannibal Lecter, the late great Hannibal Lecter would like to have you for dinner. He wants you for dinner. That’s the end of you, by the way. But no, these people are being dumped into our country and nothing good is going to happen from it. That’s why we have to do a big deportation and get them the hell out, okay? We have no chance.
(01:05:17)
Meanwhile, our crime rate is going up while crime statistics all over the world are plunging. We have become a dumping ground for the world, which is laughing at us. They can’t believe how stupid we are, how stupid, stupid, stupid we are. We’re destroying our country. They can’t believe what they’re getting away with, but they’re getting away with it at levels that they never thought possible. In Venezuela, crime is down 72%. Caracas, Venezuela is a very, very dangerous place. And now because of the great job they’ve done in removing their criminals into the United States, next year we’re going to have our Michigan rally in Caracas, Venezuela because it’s nice and safe, okay? Does that sound like a good idea to you?

Audience (01:06:07):

Yeah!

Donald Trump (01:06:08):

Because we want safety. Now the press is going to write that. They’re going to say, “Donald Trump proposed next year’s Michigan rally in Caracas, Venezuela.” They’ll say, “Isn’t that horrible? Isn’t that unpatriotic?” You understand. This is what I have to go with. I’m only kidding, press. I’m only kidding. Although maybe it’s not a bad idea.
(01:06:29)
So El Salvador is an interesting one because I know the president, he’s a young guy. Young guy. And he’s been getting this great press, this great press that his crime rate’s way down and they’re training their criminals. Well, you don’t train criminals, okay? Maybe every once in a while you get lucky, but you don’t. So in El Salvador, murders are down 70%. He’s saying, “Yes, we’re teaching…” He’s different. Most of them just say, “Well, the United States is stupid, so we’re dumping all our criminals.” He does it differently. Smart. He goes, “We’re working with our people that are causing problems in crime.” He’s not working with them. He’s dumping them in the United States. And their crime rate, their murder rate is down 72%, 73% and going up.
(01:07:14)
I don’t blame them because if I was running one of those countries, and we’re not just talking in South America, but if I were running one of those countries, I would’ve been doing it much more. They’re also emptying their jails. The big thing is their jails. Those jails were packed. Now all of a sudden it’s like, “Oh, isn’t this wonderful? They’re doing such a wonderful job.” They’re dumping their criminals into the United States of America, and we are not going to take it anymore. Stupid people.
(01:07:45)
You are not going to teach a criminal not to be a criminal. Not going to happen. And you don’t have the time. You don’t have the energy because you have to do other things. That is why as soon as I take the oath of office, we will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country. Even larger than that of President Dwight D. Eisenhower many years ago. He was a big deportation person.
(01:08:26)
Under the radical left Democrats, Michigan communities are being overrun with migrant crime. You know that better than anybody, right? Does everybody agree? It’s being unbelievable.

Audience (01:08:37):

Yeah!

Donald Trump (01:08:37):

In Oakland County, criminal squads of illegal alien gang members are hiding into trees and breaking into Michigan homes after dark, looting them for jewelry, purses. They’ve taken the women’s purses right out of their bedrooms, electronics, cash. They’re stealing. They’re the houses. Earlier this year in Kent County… Does anybody live in Kent County here?

Audience (01:09:00):

Yeah!

Donald Trump (01:09:03):

Sounds good to me, but you’re not going to like this. A sadistic, illegal alien of which there are many criminals was sentenced for executing a 22-year-old Grand Rapids woman while she was in her car with her 1-year-old baby, shooting her at least five times with a rifle at point-blank range while the killer was wanted on an outstanding warrant for attempted strangulation of another woman. When I returned to the White House, we will stop the plunder, rape, slaughter, and destruction of our American suburb cities in town.
(01:09:39)
We will shut down deadly sanctuary cities. We’re not going to have them anymore. And we will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement. We’re going to get the bad ones out. We’re going to get them out immediately. It’s not going to take long. We’re going to rely on law enforcement, and we’re going to give law enforcement back their dignity, respect, and power so they’re allowed to protect you.
(01:10:15)
It’s no wonder Joe Biden and his thugs are so desperate to stop us. They know that we are the only ones who can stop them. We’re the only ones. We talk about Biden like he’s a feeble old guy, and he is. He is. But it’s the people that surround him. I mean, he’s perfect for them. This is the fascists and communists and some bad people surround him. I know just about all of them. I can tell you about all of them.
(01:10:42)
Did you hear about our big victory in Florida last week? Did you hear? We won the big case? “We’re going to take down Trump. We’re going to take down Trump.” Now, when you have a great court system, when you have honorable judges, people that really love the country, good things can happen. But we won that case in its entirety. “That was the one that’s going to take him down,” they’ve been saying that for what? Eight years now, right?

Audience (01:11:08):

[inaudible 01:11:09].

Donald Trump (01:11:09):

And here we are leading in every poll. We got to get it close. You got it close. You got it close. We don’t want to talk too much. I always say if we win, if we win, because I don’t like to say “When we win.” Because they cheat like hell. So if we win. But we got to get it close. We’re close four months. But you know what four months is in this racket? Like an eternity. Four months is like an eternity, but we’re leading by a lot, not just by a little. We’re leading every state, every important swing state by a lot, and we’re leading nationally by a lot, but we got to get it close.
(01:11:48)
The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020, and we’re not going to allow them to rig the president election in 2024. We’re not going to allow it.

Audience (01:12:01):

[inaudible 01:12:04].

Donald Trump (01:12:22):

Every time the radical left Democrats, Marxist, communist and fascist indict me, I consider it a great badge of honor. I’ve been indicted more than the legendary Alphonse Capone, Scarface. He was a tough man. See that guy right there? Ultra MAGA. You’re ultra MAGA. He’s tough as hell. But if Alphonse didn’t like you, you would be in the foundation of a building rising someplace in you’re great state, right? He was a tough cookie, this guy.

Audience (01:12:51):

[inaudible 01:12:53].

Donald Trump (01:12:53):

I got indicted more than Alphonse Capon. Think of it. My parents are looking down. I had wonderful parents. They never saw this for me. They never saw. Let’s see, I’m voting for… Oh, I don’t want to even read that one. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate it.
(01:13:09)
But I’m being indicted for you. Don’t worry about these fake indictments.

Audience (01:13:13):

[inaudible 01:13:15].

Donald Trump (01:13:14):

These aren’t indictments. These are Biden indictments. These are a sick, weak, pathetic man who can’t run an election so he indicts his opponent thinking that’s going to win, and in many cases it would. Third World countries do this a lot. Banana Republics do it a lot. We’ve never done it, and we’re going to teach them why they can never do it again, because it’s actually… Hard to believe, it’s actually driven our poll numbers way up.
(01:13:43)
And then we had the debate. Did anybody watch the debate?

Audience (01:13:48):

Yeah!

Donald Trump (01:13:48):

Poll. Poll. Who won the debate? Biden?

Audience (01:13:55):

Boo!

Donald Trump (01:13:56):

Or Trump?

Audience (01:14:01):

Yeah!

Donald Trump (01:14:01):

Poll. Free Poll. I just saved $300,000. Isn’t it something these pollsters, they… Oh, I have Tony Fabrizio and McLaughlin back there. I got to be careful, but I just saved 300,000 during that poll. 97 people have been interviewed, and Trump is leading by a little smidgen. I got 25,000 people here or something. They got so many people outside. I wish we could include them. I’d love to get them in. Would anybody like to leave now and let the other people come?

Audience (01:14:31):

No!

Donald Trump (01:14:33):

That’s not nice. Never forget our enemies want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom. They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you. And in the end, they’re not after me. They’re after you. I just happen to be standing in their way, and I always will, right? I always will, fellas. So we have some exciting news today because we’re pleased to be joined by many outstanding Michigan patriots they are. I know every one of them, including your next US senator from Michigan, Mike Rogers. And Mike is just as adamant as me. He’ll vote to stop the invasion, end inflation, halt the outsourcing of Michigan jobs and bring back the auto industry. You are going to double or triple your auto industry within the next three years under Trump. Mark it down. Mark it down.
(01:15:49)
Because we’re not taking their cars. We want them to build the cars here using you people to build them. Also with us is another good man who is running for Michigan Senate seat, Sandy Pensler. Do you know Sandy? So I have a big announcement to make then. Sandy has just announced that he would like to do something very important tonight. So you have Mike, who’s a total pro, Sandy who’s a total pro. I’d like to ask both of them to come on up. And I’d like to have Sandy make a statement first. Thank you. Come on up, fellas.

Yeah! [inaudible 01:16:56].

Sandy Pensler (01:16:55):

Thank you, Mr. President. I was so inspired when President Trump kissed the empty uniform of Corey Comperatore. I flashed back immediately to a couple days after 9/11 at the local firehouse where I hugged the lone remaining survivor and looked out at 12 empty uniforms. Thank you for honoring all of them as well. My campaign was always about making America better. The best way to do that is to enact President Trump’s policies. Let’s go Trump! Let’s go Trump! To do that, we need control of the Senate. A divisive continued primary effort hurts the chances of that, and that’s not okay. So tonight I’m doing the right thing and ceasing my Senate candidacy. No, no, it’s not an “Ah.” It’s the right thing. President Trump endorsed Mike Rogers. Tonight, so am I.

Audience (01:18:42):

Yeah!

Sandy Pensler (01:18:52):

Mike’s going to make a heck of a senator. So I want you guys to look around the room tonight because everything goes through Michigan, the presidency, the Senate, the House and the State House. Look around, make a pledge to each other. We’re going to fight, fight, fight like hell to save America and elect Donald Trump, Mike Rogers, and the rest of the ticket on the Republican Party. Thank you.

Audience (01:19:26):

USA! USA! USA! USA!

Mike Rogers (01:19:37):

Thank you, Sandy. I am honored to have you stand with us in all Republicans to win the state of Michigan. Thank you for your courage. Thank you for your leadership. You’re going to be an important voice going forward in our party in Michigan. And Mr. President, I want to say this as a former law enforcement guy, it wasn’t that the bullet took you to the ground. It was the fact that you got back up for America.

Audience (01:20:22):

USA! USA! USA! USA!

Mike Rogers (01:20:22):

You bet. I have spent my career working to protect America as an Army officer, as an FBI agent working organized crime in Chicago, as the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. I have never seen a more unsafe America because of the Democrats over the last four years.
(01:20:54)
Here’s the good news, Mr. President. You’ll have a partner in the United States Senate that will bring manufacturing back to Michigan. We are the arsenal of democracy. We will be again in this great state. And I’ll pledge to you, I will get Department of Justice reoriented to actually going after criminals. We are going to dismantle fentanyl distribution from here to the steps of China, and we’re going to tell China, “You sell in the United States. You’ll have a price to pay.”
(01:21:43)
Mr. President, I’ll guarantee you this as well. With your leadership, winning the state of Michigan, winning for the United States, putting America back in Washington, DC versus Washington, DC and the rest of America, we will make America respected again. We will bring back law and order again. We will make America safe again. Let’s flip the Senate. Let’s elect Donald Day Trump and Mike Rogers to the Senate, and let’s get busy. Thanks, Mr. President.

Donald Trump (01:22:30):

We’re unifying the party, and that was beautiful to watch. Thank you, Sandy and Mike. And Mike, good luck. You’re running against somebody that’s such a bad senator. I was there for four years plus. I don’t even remember meeting that particular person. This is not a senator for Michigan. Mike Rogers is going to be a great senator. He’s got gravitas. He really knows his way. Highly respected in Washington. I mean, it should be an easy race. Nothing’s easy, but it should be an easy race. So good luck. Good luck. And thank you very much, Sandy, Mike.
(01:23:09)
We’re also joined by members of Congress and the great people, friends of mine, warriors, Jack Bergman. Jack? Thank you, Jack. Great job. A real friend of mine, somebody I was very much in favor of right at the beginning, John James. Thank you, John. A warrior, somebody who helped me through a lot of different things. He gets things done, Bill Huizenga. Bill, thank you, Bill. Thank you very much. And another one. These are all great people. Tim Wahlberg. Thank you for everything you’ve done, Tim. You’ve been unbelievable. Always there for me, right? Always there.
(01:24:03)
And a man from a slightly different location, a little bit down. You’re not going to get there with an electric car, unless you want to stop a few times, but he comes from a state known as Florida. Great place, and he’s so respected. He’s such an incredible man. Brian Mast. Brian. Thank you. Thank you, Brian. Oh, Brian. Thank you, Brian. What a guy he is. He’s a warrior. He’s a real warrior. Thank you, Brian. Michigan House Republican leader, Matt Hall. Thank you, Matt. Good job you’re doing, Matt. Are we going to win, Matt? Will you please make sure? We need these local ones, right? That’s right.
(01:24:43)
Michigan Senate Republican leader, Aric Nesbitt. Thank you Aric. Great. Thank you. Good job.
(01:24:53)
A congressional candidate who I hear is doing very well, Tom Barrett. Tom, get in there and win. Good.
(01:25:04)
A friend of mine who was really brave, ran a tough phrase. It’s amazing, actually. Really did well. Her father was a very special guy. He was in the steel industry and he passed away, a battle with cancer. A long time battle, but he was fantastic, and I got to know him both very well. She’s a terrific woman. Tudor Dixon. Thank you, Tudor.
(01:25:37)
Ambassador Joe Cella. Thank you, Joe. Good job you’re doing, Joe.
(01:25:44)
Very important person in this room, Michigan GOP chairman, where are you? Okay. Pete Hoekstra. Oh, there he is. I fought like hell for him to take that job, right, Pete? I said, “Pete, you got to do it.” How are we doing, Pete? How are we doing? Huh? We’re doing good. If you’re in charge, he’s going to win. He was a congressman, a really good one, respected. He left. I made him ambassador. He was a great ambassador, and I then said, “Pete, you got to do it.” He lives here. I said, you got to do it. And we appreciate you doing it. Both of you, thank you very much. We appreciate it very much.
(01:26:24)
RNC Chairman, he put on that show with a person named Laura Trump. How good is she? How good is she? She’s unbelievable. She made a great speech. And her husband made a very good speech the other night, didn’t he? Eric and Don. I don’t want to talk about anyone else. Only my kids, you know? But they all did well. Everybody did well, honestly. I do think Hulk Hogan, I thought he was incredible. I hadn’t seen him in a while. And I’ll tell you what, I’m not going to mess with him. We’re not going to mess with a Hulk there, but he was fantastic the other night. All of them, every single one. My granddaughter did very well. Look at she… Who said that? Who said my granddaughter? Wow. Kai. Kai is great. Great golfer. She’s a great golfer.
(01:27:18)
But we have another man who’s very important and the RNC chairman, Michael Watley, who’s been incredible. Wherever Michael. Mike. Thank you, Mike. Great job. I said, “Michael, you have one job. We got so many votes, we don’t know what to do with them. You got to guard the vote. When those votes get put in, they can’t be missing. They can’t throw them out. They can’t stuff ballot boxes. They can’t cheat. Make sure.” He headed up North Carolina. And on that night a while ago, that certain election night, that miserable where we thought it was 1:00 at 10 o’clock in the evening, and then all of a sudden additional votes have been reported in various places. We don’t have to get into it. North Carolina held totally steady. He had 603 lawyers working. Other people didn’t have lawyers working, and bad things happened. But this guy held, and I said, “That’s the guy I want to run the party.”
(01:28:17)
And Michael, I know you’re doing a great job and you’re going to do something very special. We don’t need votes. We need to guard the vote. You ever hear the expression, “too big to rig”? The more we get in there, the harder it is for them. My daughter and her husband, Tiffany and Michael, where are you? Tiffany and Michael, you’re around here someplace. Two great people. Fairly recently. Thank You, Tiff. Great people. And Michael’s father’s here tonight. Highly respected guy. Great businessman and a highly respected guy.
(01:28:53)
From the moment we take back the White House from crooked Joe Biden and Kamala… I call her laughing Kamala. You ever watch her laugh? She’s crazy. You can tell a lot by a laugh. No, she’s crazy. She’s nuts. She’s not as crazy as Nancy Pelosi. Crazy Nancy. Did you see Nancy Pelosi is selling out Biden now? Did you see?

Audience (01:29:17):

Yeah.

Donald Trump (01:29:17):

She turned on him like a dog. “Well, I don’t know if he should continue.” All of a sudden, where did that come from? She was 100%. All of a sudden she’s not sure. Not sure means he’s gone. But no, she’s crazy as a bedbug. She’s a crazy person.

Audience (01:29:33):

[inaudible 01:29:38].

Donald Trump (01:29:38):

I believe we’re going to have the four greatest years of the history of our country, I believe it. And I believe that Michigan is going to have the greatest of all of any of the states because I’m going to bring back your auto industry. I’m not going to take this.

Donald Trump (01:30:01):

In Mexico, they’re building among the largest plants for auto manufacturing anywhere in the world, in Mexico, near the border. They think that they’re going to make cars and sell them into the United States and lose all our jobs. It’s not happening. And you know who owns those plants? China. China owns them. And we’re not letting it happen. We’ll put 200% tariffs on, 400, I don’t care what would… Whoever is building your plants, we’re not allowing any of those cars to come into the United States, okay? We’re telling that to Mexico, right? You want to build those plants?
(01:30:40)
A friend of mine who builds plants, that’s all he can do. He’s a great guy, but his strength is plants. If you say, “Walk across the street,” he’s not that good at it. But to build a plant, he has no problem. He builds a great auto plant. So I said, “I’d like to see one. Take me.” He goes, “We’ll have to go to Mexico.” I said, “What about the United States?” “No, not so much.” He goes, “They’re actually some of the biggest in the world, being built right now in Mexico.” I said, “This happened over the last couple of years with this stupid president that we have.” Stupid. He’s a stupid person.
(01:31:12)
And I can say it because once you weaponize justice… I would never talk about a president like that. Once he weaponized justice against me, I said, “Oh, wow, that’s really incredible. That’s never been done before.” I can do it and I’m knocking them out. But sometimes you have crooked judges. We have some real crooked judges, too. That’s the only way. The only I can lose is crooked judges, but we’ll get it overturned, anything that happens. But once he weaponized… I wouldn’t talk that way. In fact, before this happened, before he did this, I’ve treated him, not nicely, but I treated him with far more respect than I do right now. It’s one of those things.
(01:31:52)
But we can’t let these companies come in and steal our wealth, steal our jobs, destroy our companies, and end up building it 10 miles across the border, and think we’re going to allow them to get away with it. We’re not. They have to build it over here and they have to use our people. So, it’s going to happen. And Michigan will benefit more than any state in the union, because they stole your auto industry, and we’re going to bring it back, and it’s going to be at a level that it was in its height. Okay? You hear that, John James? You hear that? We’re going to put John James in charge.
(01:32:36)
And the amazing thing, it’s not even hard to do. It’s not even hard, it’s so crazy. If you want to build something in China, you’re building it here and you send it over there, “We don’t want it.” They’ll charge you like 250% tariff. “We don’t want it.” Then you get an invite. “Build your plant over here.” So, these companies, they go over there. Harley-Davidson did it in India. They couldn’t sell. They had a 200% tariff on motor bikes. I had them in the office, in the White House, the Oval Office, and the head of Harley-Davidson. I was disappointed in that, actually, that we were talking about it.
(01:33:13)
I was telling him the problems and I was going to help them out. But I said, “How are you doing in India?” “No good.” “Why?” “We have a 200% tariff.” In other words, if we sell a bike, they have this massive tariff. And I said, “If you have a 200% tariff, that means, yeah, that means you’re not going to be able to sell any.” But they invited them over to build a plant, and Harley-Davidson went, and I guess they’re building the plant or built it or something. But that’s what they do. I don’t blame India; I blame us for allowing it to happen. It’s not going to happen anymore.
(01:33:41)
I had it stopped, and then we had the COVID fight, we had to fight COVID. We did a great job. We never got the credit. We got credit for military, we got credit for everything, I defeated ISIS. We did unbelievable things. Unbelievable. We got the biggest tax cut in history, the biggest regulation cuts in history. When I go to the companies, the big companies, highly sophisticated, I said, “So, I got you the biggest tax cuts in history, and that was good for jobs, and I got you the biggest regulation cuts in history, and that was good for jobs. If you could only have one, would you take the regulation cuts or the tax cuts?” Every single person, and I must have asked the question 200 times over the years, said the regulation cuts were more important than the tax cuts. Can you believe it? You wouldn’t think that. But we got you the biggest regulation cuts in history. Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the presidency… We, we win, we’re going to all win it together. I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled, and I will be the only one that can make this statement. I will prevent World War Three from happening. You’re very close to World War Three. If I was president, the Afghanistan disaster, which probably caused Putin to go in, and by the way, he wouldn’t have gone in with me. He would’ve never gone in with me, and he didn’t. And by the way, he didn’t. But the Afghanistan disaster, not the fact we’re getting out, I was getting out. After 21 years, you get the hell out. But I would’ve kept Bagram. It’s one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons. We gave it to them so stupidly, it’s one of the biggest airfields in the world. We built it many years ago for billions of dollars. We were going to keep that. We were going to man it, keep it. Think of it, one hour away. You know who has it now? China has it now. How stupid are we? Should have kept that.
(01:35:48)
And you know the lift? The lift should have been done at Bagram, not their little local airport where they had riots all over the place and then the bombs started going, killing 13 of our great people. Obliterating, I heard the number this morning, 47. That’s maybe the right number, because we’re looking at 47. You know that, right? Obliterated 47 great young Americans. Their legs gone, their arms gone, their face just wiped out. And hundreds of people besides, hundreds of people. The worst catastrophe, the worst, most embarrassing disaster, I think, ever, that happened ever in this country. And because of that, I think Putin looked at that, the incompetence, the stupidness of Milley and these guys that don’t know what the hell they’re doing. And he looked at it and he said, “This is a great time to go into Ukraine.” But he would’ve never done it with me.
(01:36:39)
If I was president, the Afghan disaster would’ve never happened, Ukraine would’ve never happened, and October, October 7th, the attack on Israel, would’ve never happened. Remember, Iran was broke, Iran had no money, they were broke. Now they have $250 billion. But we’ll get along with Iran, we’ll get along with whoever we have to get along with. But it would’ve never happened, all of the things. And you know what wouldn’t have happened? Inflation wouldn’t have happened, because I had energy low, inflation was caused by energy going up twice. I will restore a thing called peace through strength. That’s what we have.
(01:37:20)
Remember, I’m the only president in 80 years that had… I started no new wars. I finished some. Totally defeated the ISIS caliphate. In my next term, we will build a great Iron Dome missile defense shield over our country, a dome the likes of which has not been seen, and it will be entirely built in the USA, and much of it will be built right here in Michigan. Why shouldn’t we have the same protection that other countries have built? Why shouldn’t we have the same protection that Israel has and that other countries have? And Ronald Reagan wanted to do this many years ago, but honestly, we didn’t have the technology. Now we do. 301 missiles were shot at Israel, and almost every one of them was knocked out of the sky. It’s an unbelievable technology, and it’s our technology, and we’re going to use it for our country, and we’re going to be a lot safer than not having it. The Iron Dome, we’re going to build the great Iron Dome, the latest and the greatest, and much is going to be made right here in Michigan, as you can imagine.
(01:38:29)
And we will not cut one penny from Social Security or Medicare. And you know they want to raise the retirement age. Biden wants to raise the retirement age on… And they’re going to. You know why? All of these immigrants coming in, they’re trying to put them onto Medicare and Social Security. So, not only do they want them to vote, they want to destroy Social Security and Medicare. It’s not going to happen. And we’re not raising your age one day. He’s going to destroy… First of all, he doesn’t have any idea what the hell he’s doing. But I kept that promise four years ago, you remember? “He’ll come in and raise Social Security.” I went through four years, it was never even a topic that was allowed to be discussed, because we have, between the liquid gold under our feet, and all of the other things and the growth mechanism that we have in this country, we don’t have to cut Social Security, which people have earned, and we’re never going to cut it.
(01:39:28)
And when you hear that stupid guy, that low IQ guy, get up and say, “I inherited 9% inflation.” False. He inherited 1.4, but really nothing. And when he says, “He’s going to raise Social Security.” No, false. He’s going to raise it, because he’s stupid, that’s why. He’s going to raise it. Don’t believe it. They have this line, this line where it goes one after the other after the other. But one thing, it’s very simple, they’re going to raise your taxes four times and that’s there, because they don’t want to renew the tax cut. The tax cuts that I gave, it’s approximately a four-times increase, and they don’t want to renew them.
(01:40:09)
But you can’t believe these people when they get up, Biden and… I watched Kamala the other day. Brilliantly put on Fox, I don’t know why Fox does it. Please Fox, will you please get smart? Will you please get smart? And she’s ranting, right? “He is going to destroy Social Security, he’s going to destroy Medicare, he’s going to destroy this.” It’s just made up, it’s just soundbites. It’s disinformation. That’s the other thing they’re good at. They say anything they want to say.
(01:40:37)
I am going to protect your Social Security, we’re not going to be raising the number of years, we’re not going to raise it by one day, let alone one year or five years or 10 years, like some stupid people want to do. We’re going to grow our country, it’s going to be growth, and it’s going to be using the assets and resources that we have, much of it right under the ground. We’re going to rebuild our cities into beacons of hope, safety, and beauty, better than they have ever been before. We’re going to have to work with the Democrat governors and mayors on that. But our cities are just horribly run.
(01:41:10)
And then we have our capital, our beautiful capital in Washington, D.C. We’re going to take it over, we’re going to clean it up, we’re going to renovate it, we’re going to rebuild it, we’re going to make our capital the most beautiful anywhere in the world. We’re going to get rid of the nightmare of murder and crime, and it will become the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world once again, but far more beautiful than it was before. And when you want to go from Michigan to see the Washington Monument… Yes, we’re keeping the name Washington, we’re not changing the name. Or the Jefferson Memorial, where there’s a big move to change the name, we’re not changing the name.
(01:41:46)
Remember when they were knocking down statues, and I was president? And I found an old bill, and I reenacted the old bill. Anybody touching, knocking down, or even trying to harm any of our great statues or monuments, goes to jail for a 10-year period, with no commutation and no shortening of the sentence. And it was a beautiful sight, as we watched everybody leave town. They left town so quickly, they left town. We said, “Bye, everybody.” No, we have to meet people that have evil intentions. They wanted to knock down the Jefferson. If I didn’t get the military out to save the Jefferson Memorial, they would’ve done the job.
(01:42:29)
But I found this old law that today, we’re almost incapable of producing things like that. 10 years, and there’s nothing like good behavior and you get out in two days. It’s 10 years in jail if you touch your monuments, if you even try to knock them down. I had a news conference, I signed it, and everybody left town. It was a beautiful thing to do. We’re not doing it. We won’t be changing the name of Jefferson, Washington, Lincoln, like they did our forts. I get out of office, they did our forts, right? We won two world wars in those forts, and now they have different names, many of them. Fort Bragg, and the people that live next to Fort Bragg, are not happy. They’re not happy. They changed the name. We won two world wars out of Fort Bragg, and then they decide to change the name because they think it’s politically correct.

Audience (01:43:27):

Preach!

Donald Trump (01:43:27):

On day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and any other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto the shoulders of our children. And I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate. And I will keep men immediately, day one, out of women’s sports. And I will fully uphold our very important, but under siege, Second Amendment, as I did for four years. And I got the full endorsement from the NRA, you saw that, they gave us their full, strongest endorsement. No, for four years I protected, and it was not that easy to do. We will protect innocent life, and we will restore free speech, and I will secure our elections. Our goal will be one-day voting with paper ballots, proof of citizenship, and voter IDs. Very simple.
(01:44:46)
But until then, Republicans must win. We have to win, win, win, win, win. We want a landslide that is too big to rig. I said it before, I’ll say it, 100, 200, 300 times before that very spectacular date. But remember, November 5th is not really the date. It starts in early September, North Carolina and some others, because now we have these ridiculous laws where you can vote before the election, after the… We got to have one day voting. One day voting. What happened to those ballots that were over there last week? “Oh, sir, we moved them around a little bit.” Oh, really? Think of it, you vote two months early, nobody knows what the hell’s going on. Where are all the ballots that happened? Why are they using a shovel? They’re shoveling off. You ever see what goes on? Take a look at what happened in Georgia, they’re shoveling ballots into wheelbarrows, moving them around.
(01:45:40)
If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States and added them up, they would not have done near the destruction to our country as Joe Biden and his horrible Biden administration have done. They’re destroying our country. They are destroying our country. And we get up and we have levity, we have laughter, but honestly, there’s really nothing funny about it. They got millions and millions of people, many of whom are criminals and terrorists, flowing through, and people from mental institutions flowing through into our country, totally unchecked. And they move many of them into hotels. Some of them are luxury hotels. Hotel owners are making a fortune. They’re destroying the hotel in a certain way, but they’re making a fortune. And our military is living on the street with nothing. And yet they’re putting these people into luxury hotels.
(01:46:35)
So, if you want to save America, get your friends, get your family, get everyone you know and vote. You got to vote early? Vote absentee? I don’t care how you vote. They will say, “Oh, sir, we have to vote early.” A lot of times you vote early, that’s gone. You got to vote, and you got to follow your vote. Make sure it doesn’t get canceled out. You can do it. Vote on election day. I don’t care how you vote: you’ve got to vote. Vote early if you want. Everyone say, “Vote early.” I don’t…
(01:47:05)
Look, you got to vote, and you got to get out and vote, you got to protect your vote. That’s what Michael’s doing. He did it better than anybody else in the country in North Carolina; that stayed right here. When Georgia went down, when Pennsylvania went down, it stayed right there. All of a sudden in certain states, they found all these votes. A totally rigged election, we’re never going to let it happen again, because this time, if it happens, we’re not going to have a country. We won’t have even a semblance of a country left. And if you want to help us ensure election integrity, sign up. It’s called ProtectTheVote.com. Protectthevote.com, sign up. And that’s on election integrity, you got to watch and watch very carefully.
(01:47:49)
So, in conclusion, from Marquette to Midland, from Lansing to Flint, and from Detroit to right here in Grand Rapids, we’ve had great victories in Grand Rapids. Remember when we won the state of Michigan? Now we did much better the second time, but I won’t mention that. But remember, and I was at Grand Rapids, and we came in and we had a crowd like nobody ever saw late in the evening. Remember that? You were there? And we had a crowd like nobody’s ever seen before. I said, “Why would we lose Michigan?” And we ended up winning Michigan. I was right.
(01:48:23)
Actually, Bill Clinton told Hillary that, he was in Michigan, “You’re going to lose.” He was a good politician, he had a natural instinct. He said, “You’re going to lose Michigan, you’re going to lose Wisconsin.” They said, “Oh, why are we listening to this man tell us this?” And he was right. Wisconsin and Michigan. I said, “Why are we going to lose?” We had 49,000 people show up. She had like, 300 people show up. I said, “Why are we going to lose?” And we won, we won Michigan. And then we did much better the second time, but bad things happen. We’re not going to let that happen anymore.
(01:48:55)
We stand on the shoulders of the brave Michigan patriots and tough Michigan workers who manned the first assembly lines. You remember that? Does anybody remember that? It’s a long time ago. Anybody remembers that, they’re extremely old. Is there anybody that wants to admit? They revolutionized industries and turned this state into a manufacturing powerhouse like no other. And we’re going to bring it back, and we’re going to bring it back. I’m not talking about lots of other industries. I’m talking about the auto industry, because it’s such a big industry. I can say we’re going to bring back cement, we’re going to bring back all sorts. I’m just talking very simple. It’s so simple, it’s going to happen so fast. You’re going to be at a level as though you were from 30, 40 years ago. You’re going to manufacture cars again at a level that you haven’t seen in many, many decades.
(01:49:47)
You probably have to get rid of this fool, this stupid idiot representing the United Auto Workers, because he sells the auto… I’m much more popular than anybody with the auto workers. We’re going to get 95% of their vote. But they have a guy, he pushes the electric mandate, and they’re going to be made in China. They got to get rid of that guy, he’s bad news. Your Michigan ancestors gave us Motown, the Mustang, and the might of the American Midwest, and it really is a might. They forged the steel, laid the railroads, tilled the fields, fought the battles, and won the victories that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world. It’s true. It was the most powerful.
(01:50:35)
But now, we are a nation in decline, and it’s a very serious decline. We are a failing nation. We are a nation run by fools and stupid people. We’re a nation that has lost its confidence, its willpower, and its strength. We’re a nation that has lost its way. But we are not going to allow this horror to continue. We’re not going to let it happen. Less than four years ago, we were a great nation, and we will soon be a great nation again. With the right leadership, every disaster crooked Joe Biden has created can be fixed, and very, very quickly. Every problem can be solved, and every wrong can be rectified.
(01:51:23)
By this time next year, America’s borders will be strong, sealed, and secure. Very easily. Get ready, Tom Homan. Inflation will be in full retreat. Our economy will be roaring back. Optimism will be surging. You will have your confidence back. We don’t have any confidence, that’s like an athlete that can’t sink the shot, can’t hit the ball, losses come. We’re going to have you hitting the ball again. We’re going to have you playing at the top of your game. The American Dream will be thriving again for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. Law and justice will reign all throughout our land. Freedom will be restored. The flame of Liberty will be burning bright. Crooked Joe Biden, the worst president in the history of our country, will be a fading memory of the past. And our great, silent majority, including the once forgotten men and women of our country, will be the ones shaping America’s magnificent future, when I am the 47th president of the United States of America. Thank you.
(01:52:43)
Because we are all Americans. And together, we will show November 5th to be the most important day in the history of America. It will be the most important day. And when we turn it, our country’s going to be great again. And if we don’t turn it, our country is finished. You know it, and I know it, and everybody knows it. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you, Michigan. Thank you very, very much. Thank you.

CROWD: We love Trump!
TRUMP: They saw some pretty bad things.
CROWD: We love Trump!
TRUMP: Thank you.
CROWD: We love Trump!
TRUMP: Thank you very much.
No, they—they did an amazing job. And we have—by the way, we have the doctor—one of the great doctors was there. He worked on Corey, actually. He—was Corey, he had a hard time. Corey—Corey is special. Thank you, Doctor. Appreciate it very much. Great—great doctors, great doctors. The job they did on David Dutch and James Copenhaver was just incredible.
And as you know, they brought them back from very, very seriously wounded. They were going to be maybe not with us. There was a group of us, but they are doing really well now. They're making it. They're going to be fine. Not going to be perfect maybe, but who is—who is? As we get older, who is perfect?
But the doctors were so great. They had two great doctors also. And most of all, we lift the memory—our memory to the brave firefighter who was so cruelly taken from us, Corey Comperatore. Corey Comperatore, a very brave guy, loved by his family and his friends. He was really loved. In his last act on this earth, Corey threw himself over his wife and daughters and died shielding them from the bullets—the bullets of a very disturbed guy. Corey is a hero to all of us—to all of us.
CROWD: Corey! Corey! Corey!
TRUMP: I want to thank a friend of mine, too. I'm not going to mention his name because he's pretty well-known, and he came up to me, he said, ""Would it be okay if I presented Corey's wife and family with a check?"" And I said, ""Yeah, it would be okay with me. It's certainly okay."" And he handed me a check for $1 million, $1 million.
Think of that. Thank you, Dan. So, he was very generous. In addition, we have a GoFundMe that's—it's really been great. I think we're at $6 million mark for the—the three of them, plus some other people. So—but you know what, Corey's wife said, ""I'd rather have my husband."" Isn't that good? I know a lot of wives that would not say that.
I'm sorry. [laughs] They would not say that. But no, it's a great family. He was a great man. He was a brave man. He saw what was happening and he jumped on top and he got hit. But we will carry Corey's spirit of love and devotion and patriotism with us for all time, and we will never forget Corey or his beautiful family.
And maybe let's have a brief moment of silence in memory of Corey, great Pennsylvanian. [Trump bows head]
Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Beautiful. Beautiful. [applause] That is the most quiet I have ever heard an arena. I have never heard—you could hear a pin drop. No, it's amazing. It's a beautiful thing. In the wake of this heinous attack, we gather tonight more determined than ever.
Our resolve is unbroken, and our will is undeterred. Nothing will stop us on our mission to make America great again. Nothing's going to stop us. Our country is doing badly.
Front-row joes over here, front-row joes. Look at them. They've been to 212 events. You know, I'm pretty sure we have their vote. I'm not sure.
You can never be sure of anything. You're voting for Trump? OK. Front-row joes, they love us and we love them. Thank you very much. Thanks, everybody. But as we're fighting to bring back the American dream for you and your family, the radical left Democrat Party bosses have installed a puppet candidate to fight only for themselves.
Kamala Harris got zero votes. [crowd boos] She's totally scripted, owned, and controlled by the donors and the power brokers who created her campaign and who rip off our government and make billions and billions of dollars. They want to call them up, and they want to—they want to deal with her. And I didn't deal like that.
I never dealt like that. I didn't need the money. I said, ""No, I don't want to do that."" I told a lot of guys that I like and some guys that I don't like but very rich people, ""I just can't do that."" I can't do it. They want to do the telephone systems. They want to do lots of little things like that. ""We'd like to take over the telephone system of the United States."" ""I'm sorry, I can't do that."" But unlike her, I cannot be bought and I cannot be controlled.
I have no interest in that. My only loyalty is to you, the people. And you know that. I could have had such a nice easy life. I could be at a nice place right now relaxing, watching the waves breaking, but I'd rather be right here in Harrisburg with you—the people that built our country. You're the people that built our country.
I mean, some people don't like saying that. But you are, indeed, the people that built the country. We have—no matter where we go, we have the most incredible people. After lying to the country for years about Joe Biden's mental and physical condition, Kamala is now being given a personality makeover.
Don't forget, four weeks ago, she was like considered the worst, not smart, terrible, the worst vice president in history. He's the worst president we've ever had, but they were considered terrible. And all of a sudden, she's the new Margaret Thatcher. That wouldn't happen, right? The great Margaret Thatcher.
No, I don't think so. But you're going to—you're going to learn little things like defund the police. That doesn't work, does it? [booing] You're going to learn. Because everything about Kamala Harris rollout, it's phony and it's fake. Did you see when President Obama and Michelle called? Did you see? ""Hello. Hello. Yes. Yes. Who is this?"" ""Oh, this is Michelle and Barack."" ""Oh. Oh."" So surprised to hear. They got four cameras in front. ""Oh, I'm so surprised."" It's on speakerphone. Listen, we just want to congratulate you on destroying Joe Biden—I mean, on winning the—Hey, is Joe Biden—was that the phoniest phone call you've ever seen?
CROWD: YES!
TRUMP: What don't you think, Dan? What do you think? Dan Meuser, great congressman. What do you think? Was that a phony phone call? You wouldn't do it. You wouldn't get away. In your district, you wouldn't get away with it, would you? But she's a defund-the-police radical trying to pass herself off as a tough-on-crime prosecutor. She wasn't tough on crime.
She's only tough on guys like me because they want to go after their political opponents. And we won the big case in Florida. Did you see? We won it. And he—and he had a similar case, but it was much worse, and he didn't have the Presidential Records Act. He had a similar case. And, you know, the special counsel, which is basically a special prosecutor, adjudged him to be essentially mentally incompetent, with poor memory, but a nice old guy.
He's not old. You know, 81 is not old. I have friends that are 95 that are still—Bernie Marcus, founder of Home Depot, 95 years old, still sharp—still sharp. I spoke to him the other day. I said, ""I think you're smarter now than you were 30 years ago."" I don't know what's going on. I said, ""What's going on, it's working for you."" Eighty-one is not old.
And—but he's different. He's a—he's a bad 81. He's a bad 81. And he's ruining—he destroyed—he's destroying our country, I'll tell you. And she's worse than he is. She is actually worse than he is because she's a real radical left. He's a phony radical left. He didn't believe this stuff. He didn't believe in open borders, and she does.
She wants to open your borders. She wants to have all-electric cars. She loves the all-electric car mandate. She destroyed San Francisco. But she's the architect of the border invasion, trying to pretend she's strong on border security. She's now pretending that she was never called the border czar. She was called the border czar the first day.
She's the border czar, and she never went. She actually went. You know, they say—they fact-check me. Anything I say is like a little—she actually went to a beautiful part of the border. I would love to take my first lady wife there to have dinner. It's beautiful, very safe. No, she didn't go to the real border, did she, front-row joe?
She went—she went to a nice little place, was there for a short period of time and left. So, she's never really been to the border, and she's the border czar. And our country is being invaded with people from prisons and people from mental institutions and terrorists. She's a failed vice president leading a failed administration while trying to convince you that she represents hope and change.
Well, she does represent change. She wants to turn us into a communist country. That's her change. [booing] She was voted the most unpopular vice president in history. That's hard for a vice president to be that unpopular, right? Just like Biden will go down as the single worst president in the history of our nation.
The happiest man is Jimmy Carter. He's an old guy right now. He's an old guy, but he's happy because his administration is considered brilliant, brilliant by comparison to this disaster that we have right now. In her speech in Atlanta last night, Kamala Harris even tried to out-brand a new Southern accent.
Did you hear her new accent? If I ever did that, all of those people back there—look at that, look at all those cameras. [booing] That's—oh, would I go through hell—I'd have a week of hell if I ever tried to do that. The contrast could not be more stark. On the one hand, you have a radical left puppet candidate who is fake, fake, fake.
And on the other hand, you have a president who will fight, fight, fight for America, right? [cheers and applause]
CROWD: FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
TRUMP: This is a hell of a big arena. How many seats—this looks like Madison Square Garden. This is a big—this is a big, beautiful place. Wow. I didn't care. I didn't care, although they'd prefer that we be in an arena.
I don't know why. But we're not giving up the outdoor rallies. You know, all those people that we had to turn away today, at an outdoor rally, you can have—we had 107,000 people show up in New Jersey, 107,000. But, you know, in the South Bronx, we had 25,000 people. It was like a lovefest. South Bronx, tough place, but it was a lot of love.
No matter how much Kamala Harris tries to change her image, she cannot change this fact: She is the most extreme liberal candidate in the history of our country by far. She's an extreme radical left lunatic. And, you know, I've been saying for the last six months, I've been saying about politicians—because I really know politicians.
Well, I've dealt with them on both sides. And, you know, then I said, ""Let's do this, you know —"" Thank you. But when a politician comes out early on with an idea like she wants to defund the police and all these other things she wants to do, really bad things, that's where they're at. They're going to be there eventually, right?
Mike Kelly. Stand up, Mike, will you, please? This guy, he used to stand up—he's my friend. He endorsed me on day one, right? Day one, day one. He endorsed me before I was running. He said, ""That guy's got to run. I endorse him."" I didn't even run. I had—""How many endorsements do I have?"" ""Well, you got Kelly of Pennsylvania."" I wasn't running.
Anyway, thank you, Mike. I appreciate it. He was—he would stand out at those outdoor rallies when it was 10 degrees below zero and it was 97 degrees out, without a shirt on. It's not that pretty a sight, not that pretty, but he would have—he had no fear. He's a tough guy, and they love him. They love you in this state.
Kamala Harris co-sponsored Bernie Sanders' $32 trillion socialist takeover of the entire U.S. health core—care system. Think of this, U.S. health care, it would mean that we're going to have to raise your taxes, bankrupt our country, and she supported outlawing all of the private health insurance. A lot of people in this room have great—some people want private health.
It's—some of it is incredible. You go to these companies; they're doing an incredible job. They want to be able to—she wants that banned, and she wants that outlawed. You can't buy that anymore. You're paying for it. But it's great stuff. I mean, some of the companies have unbelievable—the golden plans and all that, and she wants it to be ended.
She pledged to give free taxpayer-funded health care to all illegal aliens. Think of that. [booing] Oh, and she'll do that, which will totally destroy our Social Security system. She sponsored a bill to give illegal aliens taxpayer-funded lawyers so they could sue us. [booing] And she called for abolishing ICE.
These are unbelievable patriots, by the way. They're almost as tough as our congressmen sitting in the front. They're almost as tough as the man that's going to be your next governor, by the way. He's tough, too. He's tough. He's a great military hero, and he'll come up—I'm allowed to have him up for a little while, right?
Just a couple of minutes, right? He's great. He's great. And I hear you're doing very well. But you get ready. You get it ready. You got to knock them dead. She compared ICE agents to members of the KKK. She likened Border Patrol agents to practitioners of human slavery. We have a lot of those great people here tonight like Brandon Judd, the head of the union, Paul.
We have so many different people, and they didn't like that analogy too much. She voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities numerous times. She supports open borders. That's all you'd have to hear. I think two words. You know, they say, ""Sir, go down the list. We have a list of 25 things."" All you have to say is two things: open borders, defund the police.
The rest is all—but, you know—although she is going to kill Social Security because by putting all of these illegal aliens into Social Security, it's dead. It's dead. She opposes even saying the words illegal alien and radical Islamic terrorists. She backs mass amnesty, mass amnesty and citizenship for all illegals.
She supports mandatory gun confiscation. Would anybody mind—[booing] Mr. Congressman, would they mind having their guns ripped out of their arms as they enter their house or their apartment? I don't think so. I don't think. She said that 70 percent to 80 percent tax rate is ""a very bold idea, something that we have to discuss very seriously."" She likes it. And, you know, all my life, I watched politicians, and they've always said, ""We will reduce your taxes. We will reduce your taxes. We will cut your taxes."" They want to give you a tax increase of five times what you're paying now. How the hell do you get elected? This country is so screwed up. Everything's backwards. We want open border. We want taxing. How do you like to be a politician? We want open borders.
We want tax increases. We want all-electric cars so that you can go 15 minutes before you charge it up. And for all the congressmen that are here, in the Midwest, they built eight charging stations. Now, you know what that is? That's like a gas pump with electricity coming out, just a charging terminal. It cost $9 billion.
Did you hear that, Mike? Did you hear that? Scott, oh, you—I said he's another tough—we got tough congressmen here. These are—these are tough cookies, these Pennsylvania guys. Wow. Look at that. We're going to introduce them in a second. Scott. So, they spent $9 billion on eight charging stations, two of which never worked.
I don't think any of them work. She wants government intervention to slash consumption of red meat. They don't want red meat. That means they don't want your cows. Get rid of your cows. We like—does anybody—would anybody like to keep red meat? Raise your hand. [cheers and applause] You know, think of it, borders, and electric mandate and all of the things, red meat, how the hell do you get elected, right?
You know how they got elected? By cheating. They got elected by cheating because nobody—they want to raise your taxes by five times. ""Oh, please vote for me. I'm going to raise your taxes five times higher."" But the red meat is to fight climate change, OK? Climate change. She supports ending cash bail to immediately release criminals upon arrest.
They kill somebody. ""No bail? Don't worry about it. No cash. You know, you just killed three people. No, let's let them out in Harrisburg. It's a wonderful place."" And in 2020, she personally urged her followers to donate money to bail out the violent rioters, get them right out of jail, including murderers.
You know what that was all about, right? In Minnesota, which I think we have a good chance of winning. Hasn't been won since 1972 by a Republican. And we're leading. Tom Emmer is going to bring that one home. They tell me he's going to bring it home. This November, the American people are going to reject Kamala Harris' dangerous liberal extremism in a massive landslide.
We're going to too big to rig, right? Too big to rig. Too big—too big to rig. We're not going to let her turn the United States into a communist San Francisco colony. We're not going to let it happen. That's what they want to do. They want to destroy our country. She's the worst. She was a bad DA long before you had your DA, long before you had some of these DAs that you have, as you know, in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania, but in Los Angeles, all over the place.
All over the place, you have bad DAs. You have radical left, horrible DAs that are funded by Soros and others, and they're weak—they're just weak on crime. They don't mind if somebody murders somebody. They don't want them to go to jail. You can kill somebody now—our country is sick. The mindset of our country is sick.
And we're not going to let her do to Pennsylvania what she did to California. She destroyed San Francisco, one of the best cities in the world, and it's in tatters. So, she's a liberal from California. She ruined the state. She ruined this great—one of the greatest cities in the world. You know, 15 years ago, a great friend of mine, Bob Tisch, great guy who's an owner of the New York Giants and a very smart guy, a wonderful guy, too.
Maybe even longer—a little longer than 15, he said San Francisco is the best city in our country. And today, it's a disaster. It's just a disaster. He passed away quite a while ago, and he would look down and say, ""What the hell happened to that city?"" But he thought San Francisco was one of the greats.
He thought Chicago was one of the greats. You know, Chicago, on July Fourth weekend, had 117 shootings and 17 people died. Think of it. This is not even believable. When you hear about Afghanistan and the horrible job that this president did with Afghanistan, a low point, but they don't have—they don't have anything like that.
In one of the most astoundingly phony moments in her speech last night, Kamala Harris bragged that ""I will proudly put my record against Donald Trump's any day of the week. I will put it against Donald Trump."" This—this—she's got one of the worst records in anywhere. Well, Kamala, let's go, challenge accepted.
Are you ready? Let's compare our record point by point. [cheers and applause]
Mike. I can't believe I'm doing it. You know, the weird thing—I mean, two weeks ago, I was talking about Biden. I didn't even know her name. Nobody did. Kamala. Hello. Beautiful. I didn't even know her name. Kamala. I heard she was a rotten border czar.
That's about all I knew about her. Her only job was the border, and she never went there. But two weeks ago, three weeks ago, it was all about Biden. Then I kept hearing they were going to steal it from him. And I said, ""You know, it's hard to do."" Because I understand, when you have the delegates—he had all the delegates.
He had 100 % of the delegates. He had 14 million votes. I said, ""You can't really do it."" But then they threatened him very strongly. They said, ""You're incompetent, and we're going to get you out."" He just won; you know. No, they happened to be right. He was incompetent, but these are minor details. No, he just won.
He had all the votes. And he could have said no, but he was afraid. And he's an angry man right now. Here's the big question I have, will he be invited to the Democrat National Convention? Will he be invited, Mr. Congressman? I don't know. Now, he will be because I'm mentioning it. If I didn't mention it, he would not be invited.
But now, they have to invite him. But you know what's crazy, the craziest thing? So, you don't mind if I go off teleprompter all the time. It's such a shame. I have these great speechwriters; they really are Ross and Vince. They're great. They're the best speechwriters. And I—you know, I hardly speak about this, but I could read the most gorgeous speech, but you may be bored to tears.
No, it's—they're beautiful. The words are beautiful. Everything's great. The sun will rise. The moon will set. The oceans will glisten. I say that's beautiful, but I'm not sure that Harrisburg wants to hear that stuff. What do you think, Congressman? What do you think, Doctor? I don't think so. No, they are great, but I tend to—I tend to go off about 75 percent of the time.
But, you know, the hard part is that three or four weeks ago, I was talking about Biden. He's incompetent. He's a horrible president. He's the worst president in the history of the country. Now, I say she's the worst vice president, which is true. She's considered the worst. She's the most unpopular vice president in the history of the country.
She did a transformation. You know the press is very corrupt. You know that. They gave her a transformation [booing] like Houdini. That was a Houdini-like—that was a magic trick. But don't worry. She's going to fall because it's not about him or her. It's about the policies. They're the same, and they're horrible, right?
But they gave her—so, you know, it's sort of like—I don't know if anybody watch UFC as an example. Do you watch it, right? Dana White, the great Dana White. Did you see him? He introduced me the other—he introduced me the other day at our convention. We had the greatest convention in the history of politics, in my opinion.
Thank you, Milwaukee and Wisconsin. And the arena was beautiful. It was an unbelievable—but Dana White introduced me. And he heads up UFC. He's done an incredible job. But it's almost like you're having a fight between two guys and one guy is getting beat up bad. Then he goes to a debate, right? The debate didn't work out too well.
How did the debate work out for him? I don't think so good, Scott. The debate didn't work out exactly good. Then he tried to recover from the debate by going out every day, and it got worse and worse. It was a basic disaster. But it's like having two fighters, and the one guy is getting beat up really badly, really—and they say, ""All right. Stop the fight. Come on out. I'll put a new one in."" That's what we have here. Kamala is the new fighter. Who cares?
Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history. You know that because you didn't have people sleeping on your lawn all night. We ended catch and release. We stopped asylum, fraud, coal. We got Remain in Mexico. Remember that one? Do you think that was easy to get? I call up the president of Mexico, a friend of mine. He's a socialist, but still he was a friend of mine. He gave us many, many thousands of troops to guard our border while we were building the wall. I built hundreds of miles of wall, and then they didn't want to finish it up, which could have taken place very quickly.
But think of it. But, you know, we got Remain—think of it, Remain in Mexico. That means you can't come into our country. You have to remain in Mexico until you get approved, of which very few people got approved. Do you think that was easy? That wasn't easy. Negotiated historic Safe Third Agreements, which are complex, I won't waste your time, but they were great, with Central American nations.
Built 571 miles, think of that, of border wall. We're going to add another 200. Far more than I said I was going to build. And it was working. It was working. It was good. We had the best illegal immigration nonflow I call it. We had—they don't—they were having a hard time. Also, drugs were way down.
Human trafficking was way down. It's human trafficking and human trafficking in women mostly. You know, it sounds ancient, human trafficking. It sounds like something from a thousand years ago, but it's as big a business, in a sense, as the drug business. And the reason is because of the internet. The internet made human trafficking a very, very big and horrible business.
They traffic in women. They put them in the trunk of a car, they put them in the back seat, and they'd close it up, and you can't even breathe, and they bring them—they bring them across the border. We had knocked it down cold. And now, it's at a level five times greater than it ever was before. Nobody's there to check.
Nobody's to look at the car. Nobody knows who's there, who's in it. But you can see it on a certain chart that I have. You know, this chart saved my life. Where is that chart? [cheers and applause] I love that chart. I'm going to sleep with that chart for the rest of my life, that chart, that chart. You know the amazing thing?
You know, the people that operate the—the computers and all the brilliant equipment we have backstage. She said to me—she's great. She's great. She should come out. Just tell her to come out here for a second. Quick, quick, quick, quick. You got to get her out. She's never done this before. She saved my life, in a sense.
I said you saved my life. Here she is. Wow. Wow. [cheers and applause] Wow. Thank you. You're going to say something? You saved my life.
UNNAMED TRUMP STAFFER: Hi.
TRUMP: Thank you. No, she's a computer genius—she saved my life. No. So, you know the stories, but that chart, I only used it probably less than 20 percent of the time.
So, in other words, we do the rallies and stuff, sometimes I'll pull it down, sometimes I won't because I do things a little bit at random while I'm up here. Hello. Look at that big fella back there. But I do things a little bit at random. But two things about the chart. It's always on my left, which means I'm gone.
It's always on my left. If it was on my left, I have, Mr. Governor—Mr. Future Governor, I have no chance because it would have been perfect, perfect hit. And it's only used a little bit. And I always use it at the end of a speech. I never used it early. In fact, she was saying today, ""It was so—we were really sort of flabbergasted because you called for it at the very beginning of your speech."" And that chart, I'm so proud of it. Now, I like it much more than I liked it before.
But see the arrow on the bottom? [gestures to screen] That's the lowest level of illegal immigration in the history of our country recorded, and that was the last week of my presidency, Mike. So, that was the last week. And look what happened to our country after that. And those are now a little bit old because if you look on the right, it's a little bit old.
Those numbers are much higher. They, right now, would go off the ceiling. And that's what happened to our country in a short period of time, three and a half years. But look at that number and look at that arrow. So, anyway, much more importantly right now, I say—I'm talking about illegal immigration real quick.
I said, ""You know what, pull up the chart. Pull it up."" And they weren't ready because—but they're so good. And I said, ""Wow, that was so quick."" There's nobody over here except for this lunatic. And because the crowd was massive, as far as the eye could see, as far as—I mean, that's why I love those outdoor sites because you don't have to send 20,000 people back home.
And I hate to do that. They come out, and they want to get in, and then you get the seats. Would anybody like to give up your seat?
CROWD: NO!
TRUMP: I thought you were nicer people than that in Pennsylvania. Anyway, so—so I—I say chart, and I go like this, ""And the chart —"" Pew. [gestures shooting gun] So, a couple of things.
She—she told me today, she said, ""You know, the amazing thing is you always call for the chart at the end of the speech, not the beginning."" So, that was one factor that's crazy. ""It's always on your left, not your right."" It happened to be on the right this time. I don't think I've ever seen it on the right.
And various other things. And if I'm here, it's over. If I'm here, it's no good. If I'm—I had to be exactly—because he was exactly where that very beautiful woman in the white is, right? Stand up. That's exactly. And my son said that's not a long distance, 100. I don't know so much about shooting other than I'm very good for the Second Amendment, I can tell you, but I don't know so much about shooting.
But I know about sports. I know about golf. He said, ""That's like sinking a two-foot putt, Dad."" That would be the equivalent. Is that right? He actually said it might be less than that because some people can't sink a two-foot putt like Biden. I would say Biden. Biden can't sink. But—but that's like sinking—did anybody see the Bryson DeChambeau thing? Did you?
CROWD: YES!
TRUMP: That was cool. We had a good time. He's a great guy, great young athlete. So, all these things, and, you know, then you figure what are the odds that that happened, right, where you're just—you're literally exactly there. You hadn't made the full turn. But that chart will always be my world's most favorite chart for a lot of reasons.
Number one is that day in Butler, Pennsylvania, and number two is look at those numbers. That was the lowest number of illegal aliens that we've ever had. So, it really was a very important—that was a very important thing. It was done by Border Patrol. Now, let's examine the record of Border Czar Harris.
She inherited the strongest border in US history and immediately turned it into the worst border nightmare in the history of the world. There's no country in the world that's ever had a border like this. I think the real number is 20 million people, maybe more. Nobody knows. You know, you have a thing called gotaways.
We have millions of gotaways, meaning people that weren't caught. They got away. Upon taking office, Harris and Biden stopped wall construction; halted all deportations; protected sanctuary cities; ended Remain in Mexico and our asylum cooperation agreements, which are very important; and allowed a gigantic invasion of our country, bringing in millions and millions of illegal aliens at levels never seen before.
Now, actually, other than that, I thought she was doing a very good job, right? She's done a wonderful job. She's the worst ever, and she's going to be your president? You'll—she will destroy our country. This November, the American people are going to compare these records, and they're going to tell Border Czar Harris, ""You have done a horrible job. You're a disgrace to our country. You're fired. Get out of here. You're fired. Get out. Get the hell out of here."" But Kamala is protected by the fake news. [booing]
They're trying to delete everything she said. Hey, did you ever see the unselect committee? The unselect committee, on January 6th, did you see where they went and deleted and destroyed all evidence? It was deleted and destroyed.
So, I think, Dan, you, and all of my friends here, should be indicted for that. They destroyed evidence. You know why? Because the evidence showed that we were innocent. The evidence showed that Nancy Pelosi should have had protection at the Capitol that I offered her and they turned it down.
The evidence showed that all these stories were fake, including me wanting to grab a big strong Secret Service agent around the neck. Think of—think of this. Think of this. I'm in a car. I say, ""Fellas, I'd love to go down to the Capitol."" ""Sir, we don't think it's good because, you know, you're very exposed to all of that."" So, OK. I said, ""You don't think we can —"" ""No."" So, I said, ""All right. Where do you want to go?"" ""We'll go back to the White House."" That's the experience.
This one person had me getting extremely upset. I don't get upset. When somebody smart says, ""Sir, you're probably better —"" and nothing was happening, just people were walking down, remember, patriotically, right?
CROWD MEMBER: Yeah! That's right!
TRUMP: Right?
Right? So, they had me coming from the back of the car. Now, these guys are very strong. They're young and strong. Not as strong as me, but they're strong. And I grabbed the one guy driving, and he got arms—he's got arms like this. I grabbed him, and I was rebuffed. And then I went over to the right. And I think he's like a world champion karate guy, right?
Like a very tough cookie. Bobby. His name is Bobby. That's all I know, but I know him well. He's a good guy. And I grabbed him around the neck, and I began to twist and turn. And he was in tremendous pain because of the power of Trump, tremendous pain. And then I went back to the White House, and I started throwing hamburgers at the wall.
This is the story this person told. So, they went to the Secret Service, they found out it was all bullshit. [cheers and applause] Everything. All made up. It was just made up, which most people—I mean, honestly, most people would think that. You know, think of me grabbing these two strong tough guys. That's what they do. The one guy said, ""You know, if I ever—if somebody ever put their arms around me —"" He's trained automatically to go with his fingers like that. [mimes gouging eyes]
You know, it's what he's trained. Me, I like other things better personally. I'd like to run the country better. That's what I'd like to do, you know. They're good with the finger. They're good with their fingers into the eye, the fingers into the eye, and you have a tendency to immediately let go and—and—and get a towel and start crying because it hurts.
They say, ""Oh, that hurts."" No, it was all made-up stuff. You know, it was all made-up stuff. But wouldn't you think it is? I mean, who would believe Trump was so angry, he grabbed the one guy who was rebuffed, then he grab the other one around the neck? These people are sick. Who would believe it? But probably some people do, even if it's five people.
But no—but some people would believe it. You know, they hear it. They deleted everything because the stories turned out to be false. They deleted everything. Nancy Pelosi turned down 10,000 troops or National Guard. If we had 500, you wouldn't have had a problem. And what you never see is the crowd. The crowd was—it was the largest crowd I've ever spoken before.
And a small portion walked peacefully and patriotically down to the Capitol. You remember the term? Peacefully and patriotically. ""He's horrible. It's insurrection."" You know, if you have an insurrection, you don't say peacefully and patriotically, right, Mike? You say let's go. No, they're—these are really bad people. These are crooked people.
And then her daughter—you saw that about a month ago. Her daughter taped her, saying that it was her fault the day—their daughter is a cinematographer. I'm sure Nancy is thrilled. They just released a tape where Nancy is saying, ""This is my fault."" This is during the thing.
Because she didn't accept my offer, she said, ""This is my fault. I could have stopped this."" Now, she's trying to say, well, she didn't really mean that. No, these are—these are bad people. They're trying to delete everything that she said over the last—think of it, this is on Kamala, it's no different, over the last 10 years that's controversial or bad.
It's like defund the police, the fact that she was given authority over the border that—you know they're trying to say that under no circumstances was she even in charge of the border. And the fake news is trying to delete everything. Are you seeing what's going on? They're trying to delete everything.
But, you know, it's a wonderful—the internet is wonderful in certain ways. We have every single copy of every article. But they're trying to delete it. Under crazy Kamala's policies—you know, when I got hit, everybody thought I was going to be a nice guy, and they thought I'd changed, remember, just before the Republican convention.
And—and nobody thought I'd be there. You know, it's not great to be there when your ear is slightly throbbing. ""Let's go to the convention, darling,"" to the first lady. ""Let's go."" But I got there. Next day, I left, right? And it was the greatest convention. But—but—and it was like a convention like no other.
It was a convention that we were all so proud of. But they all said, ""Trump is going to be a nice man now. He came close to death."" And I really agreed with that for about eight hours or so. And then I realized they were trying to put me in prison for doing absolutely nothing wrong. They went to judges who are crooked judges.
They went to judges who are fake. They had prosecutors who are Democrat radical lefts and always in areas where it's like 3 percent Republican or less. And I said, ""You know, these are bad people."" So, I was nice for about, what would you say, Dan, three, four, or five hours, and then I said, ""These are bad people. We have to win this battle."" And you know what, they're going to become nicer when we win. But we're going to have to win, I believe, to make them reasonable because they are crazy. They are crazy. [cheers and applause]
Under Kamala's policies, criminals, rapists, and vicious gang members are pouring in from South America, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, from prisons, from jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums.
You know, an insane asylum is a step above, right? This is—oh, they go crazy when they want to try and say he's cognitively impaired. You know, I stand up here for two hours, and I speak without a mistake. But when I say Hannibal Lecter, they say, ""Why does he keep mentioning —"" because Hannibal Lecter was a serious psycho, right?
He was ""Silence of the Lambs."" Dr. Hannibal Lecter, he'd like to have you for dinner. See the man with the wall, stand up. Look at this guy. He's here so much. He's great. He's great. He's—He's a Trump voter. I don't think we have to worry about him, do we? He's a Trump voter all the way, but Hannibal Lecter would like to have you for dinner.
But these people are now in our country. And they always—you know, actually, it's quite clever, I think. But, you know, what do you do? But they're always saying like, ""He mentions Hannibal Lecter. It doesn't make sense."" No, it makes a lot of sense. They're coming into our country, and they're coming in from insane asylums, which are closing all over the world, it's not just South America, because we have the worst people representing our country.
They laugh at the stupidity of these people. All over the world, they're coming from the Congo in Africa. Twenty-two prisoners right out of prisons from the Congo in Africa. Not just South America. Meanwhile, our crime rate is going up. How about where they say, ""Our crime rate is going down."" We just had 117 people shot.
You could take just Chicago and the whole nation's crime rate. Look, these are bad people. They're phony people, they're liars, they cheat on elections, they do a lot of bad things, and we have to win this election because crime statistics are a disaster. They're made up by people that work in the White House.
And obviously, the crime is getting worse because we have probably 20 million people in our country right now. And every single day, you read about one of these horrible monsters from parts unknown who raped a young girl, killed her, cut them up, used his knives, not guns because it's a slower death. These are monsters, and we have them in our country.
And we're going to deport them at a level like nobody's ever seen. We're going to get them the hell out of our country, and they're going back to the country from which they came. Because we have become a dumping ground for the world, and we're not going to take it anymore. We're going to get rid of these liberal lunatics like Kamala.
Just yesterday, it was reported that more than 1,000 members of the savage Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua are plotting to conduct ambush attacks on police and law enforcement in the United States. All the while, Harris and Biden sit in the White House and try and figure out who's dumber. They sit in the White House.
Think of it, massive—massive numbers of Venezuelan gang members. Now, Venezuela is very smart. They sent them into our country, and then you read that crime is down 72 percent in Venezuela, which it is. On Sunday, in a separate incident, a Venezuelan illegal alien criminal let in the border by our border czar, Harris, shot a female police officer in Texas, you read about it, multiple times with a rifle.
Thankfully, the officer is perhaps going to survive. They don't know yet, but probably. But most victims are not so lucky. In Texas, last month, 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray was tied up, sexually assaulted, and strangled to death by two illegal aliens who Biden and Harris released into the United States.
If Border Czar Harris stays in charge, every single week, we'll bring never-ending streams of illegal alien rapists, bloodthirsty killers, and child predators to go after our sons and our daughters and our wives and our husbands. They're letting horrible people into our country. They're poisoning—they're poisoning our country.
By contrast, if I am elected, on day one, we will begin the largest deportation operation in American history and we will immediately deport all of the criminals that Border Czar Harris has allowed to enter our country. They'll be deported. But no comparison of our immigration records would be complete without considering the terrorists that this crazy border czar of ours is letting into America.
By the way, can anybody imagine her as—in all fairness, we want to be politically correct and all that. Great. Who cares? Can anybody imagine her dealing with President Xi of China, who's a fierce individual, fierce person? You know, she was sent to deal with Putin to keep him from invading Ukraine, which, by the way, he would have never done if I were president.
Israel wouldn't have been attacked. He would not have attacked Ukraine. The recent hits on Israel wouldn't have taken place. We wouldn't have had inflation. You wouldn't have had that horrible disaster in Afghanistan. None of these things would have happened. We'd be respected again. Now, we're laughed at. All over the world, they're laughing at us. When I was president, terror watchlist encounters at the border reached—one year—and I don't believe it. It was done by Border Patrol and ICE.
They have one year where it was zero. They said—and I don't even believe that myself. But you know what, I'll take it because the charts are usually the other way. Zero. And then after—and it was part of that that we just looked at, but we had zero terrorists reported coming in in 2019. I believe the year was 2019. Zero.
So, let's say it was 10 or 20. Now, it's thousands of people coming in. I never believed the zero, but I'll tell you, we'll take it. But assuming it was 10, 15, 20, thousands and thousands of terrorists are pouring into our country. Under Kamala Harris, thousands of terrorists have been let right in—right in. And according to news reports, the Biden-Harris administration has absolutely no idea who they are or where the hell they come from.
Just come on into our country. But you're going to be finding this out. You're going to have to be thinking—you're going to have a migrant crime statistic that's going to rival anything that we've ever had. And the only thing good about these people—they're very tough people. They come out of those jails and those prisons and those mental institutions.
The only thing that is really good about them is they make our criminals look like very nice people. It's true. Our criminals that we used to fear, we don't fear anymore, Doctor. They're like nice people compared to the people that are coming into our country. No candidate who would knowingly keep the border open as terrorists pour across it can ever be trusted to be commander in chief.
You can't do it. You can't let her—you can't let it happen. If she becomes your president—and I think worse than Biden. I think worse than Biden. And he's gone. He's shot. But if she becomes your president, our country is finished, I'll tell you. And Pennsylvania, your beautiful commonwealth—it's always good when you remember it's a commonwealth.
He would call it a state often. Remember when Biden used—I used to love this guy because you were on pins and needles watching him speak. You know, when is he going to blow it? And it would always happen. Remember, he'd finished his speech and he couldn't find the stair. [turns around and raises arms] And then these handsome men would run up and grab him and help him.
And every time I imitated, the first lady tells me, ""Why—why do you keep doing that? Because they keep saying you can't find the stairs off the —"" You know, you've only got about nine stairways off the podium. But unlike Kamala Harris, I will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.
We're going to keep them out. It's going to be safe. We're going to have a safe country. The fact is, four years ago, we were respected like never before. I would say like never before. We were respected by China, by Iran. Look at Iran. Iran is going wild now, aren't they? You know, Iran was broke when I was president.
They didn't have money to give to Hamas. They didn't have money to give to Hezbollah. Do you see what's going on now with Hezbollah now? You're going to end up in a world war. You're going to end up in a third world war pretty soon with this—with this guy. Between Ukraine and Russia and the stupidity with—I will get that negotiated and end it before I ever take office.
I'll do it after the election as president-elect. In addition to her atrocious record on border security, Kamala Harris would also obliterate Pennsylvania's economy. You know about that. She's against fracking. She's against oil drilling. She wants everybody to have one electric car and share it with the neighbors.
Harris has stated repeatedly that she supports banning fracking. ""I ban fracking. I will ban it on my first day."" Now, she's denying it. Remember, a politician always goes back to what their original thought was, right? And she co-sponsored the $100 trillion green new scam designed to abolish the oil, coal, and natural gas industries entirely.
We have more liquid gold under our feet than Saudi Arabia, than Russia by far. And under me, we took it—from fourth place and third place, we took it to first place by a lot. We were energy-independent, soon to be energy-dominant. We were going to make so much money, we're going to pay off debt and reduce your taxes still further.
Now, you can't do anything with these lunatics. Under a Harris presidency, 423,000 Pennsylvania jobs are linked to fracking, they'd all be demolished. She's against fracking. She's not going to allow you to frack. She's not going to allow you to frack. And the only reason they're allowing it now—you know, they cut it way back.
That's what caused the inflation. And then he opened it up again back to the Trump days. He opened it up to the same because it's similar because he wanted to try and get reelected. They didn't know his party was going to overthrow him. It was a coup. This was a coup of a president. He will be famous. He will be more famous for the coup than the bad job he's done, OK? But this was a coup of the president of the United States.
This was a—like a South American—you know, you read about South America. Every week, they have a coup, and they also do the attacks on political opponents, by the way. Your economy would take a $41 billion hit, this is Pennsylvania, gutting billions of dollars from your state and local budgets, slashing funding for your schools and police forces, and plunging Pennsylvania into severe economic depression.
Enjoy it. Look, if they get in, your state is screwed. Your state is—you guys are screwed. Good luck, everybody. Have a—have fun in Congress, Mike. But I will never let that happen. But you don't need to take my word for it alone. Kamala's anti-American energy crusade—let's just listen to her. Now, she's a totally—oh, no, I love fracking.
Let's just see what her video says. She had a tape just a little while ago. Let's go.
[start of pre-recorded video]
INTERVIEWER: Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your first day in office, adding the United States to the list of countries who have banned this devastating practice?
KAMALA HARRIS: There's no question, I'm in favor of banning fracking. [booing]
[end of pre-recorded video]
TRUMP: OK? If I said that, nobody would believe it. So—and that's where she is. She's a radical left person who destroyed San Francisco, and she'll destroy the country just like she did California and San Francisco. She was the leader of that pack that destroyed San Francisco. It's not only Gavin New-scum.
Gavin New-scum, he's another beauty. Oh, we're doing great in the state. Everyone's leaving. ""We're doing great. The state's doing wonderfully."" They do have wonderful weather and it's a beautiful place, but it's overridden with crime. He is doing such a terrible job. He's a con man. You know, I watched him in the great Sean Hannity Show, and he was in, saying like ""No, the state has never done better. Never done —"" It's all fake. It's all lies. The state is a disaster. They're moving to Texas, Florida, Tennessee. They're moving to a lot of North Carolina, South Carolina.
When we win this November, we will end the Biden-Harris war on American energy and we will end their terrible war on fracking. Fracking is incredible, the money you make in Pennsylvania. You could quadruple your taxes if you—if you lost that industry, you could quadruple your taxes. The policy of the Trump administration will be to drill, baby, drill. [cheers and applause] Right? Right? I will also terminate the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate on day one and save the US auto industry from destruction.
We are going to rebuild our auto industry. And the United Auto Workers are mostly going to vote for me, but, you know, they have a head of the United Auto Workers who's a fool. He's giving our auto industry to China by allowing this electric mandate to even be thought of. And again, I'm all for electric cars.
There's a certain little section that wants to have electric. I can understand that. But it's a small section. They want to have gasoline-powered cars, they want to have hybrids, and they're going to have that. They don't want to stop every 15 minutes. They refuse to stop. You know, I have a friend of mine, got an electric car, and he was used to driving from Kentucky, great state, to Washington.
And he drive, and, you know, he'd drive it. That would be it. Now, he's driving it. He had to stop six times. He said, ""What the hell is going on?"" He thought it was good for the environment. It's not good for—you know, he's an idealistic kind of guy. I think I'm going to do something good for the environment.
He got rid of that thing so fast; your head would spin. And it's great if you want to go to the candy store and back. Then you plug it in in your garage. It's no wonder the Democrat Party and their thugs are so desperate to stop us. They know that we are the only ones who can stop them, the only ones. You know, this is a movement—Make America Great Again.
This is a movement, the likes of which no country, but our country has never seen before. MAGA. MAGA. No country has ever seen anything like it. Remember when Biden would get up, ""We will stop MAGA."" He had no idea. I said, ""Joe, do you know what it means?"" ""No, not really."" No, it means Make America Great Again.
We don't want to stop it. All of their persecution is only happening because I am running for president and leading big in the polls. Oh, if I wasn't, I wouldn't have any of these lawsuits. Oh, they wouldn't be suing me because I'm breaking their ass, also. They wouldn't be suing me. They're doing this because I'm running and I'm leading, and I'm leading by a lot.
We're leading by a lot in this state, by the way, in this commonwealth. We're leading by a lot in our commonwealth. The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020, and we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election of 2024. We're not going to allow it to happen. And every time the radical left Democrats, Marxists, communists, and fascists indict me, I consider it a great badge of honor.
Thank you very much. Because I'm being indicted for you. Did you like my mugshot? Did you like the mugshot? Lovely. My father's looking down—my mother and father, they're looking down because they're definitely in heaven. They made heaven. They're great. They're looking down, they said, ""I can't believe my son took a mugshot. This is unbelievable."" But it's the No. 1 selling mugshot in history. It beat Elvis and it beat Frank Sinatra. Did you know that? Frank Sinatra had a big one. Did you know he got arrested for something? And I think Elvis had a fight at a gas station or something. But Elvis was one. Frank Sinatra was two.
And I'm proud to admit and I'm proud to tell you that you have made mine bigger than both of them by a lot. It's the biggest-selling mug shot ever. And I still haven't figured out whether or not I'm happy about it. I'm not sure. In one way, I'm thrilled. In another way, I'm not sure I like it. Never forget, our enemies want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom, which is true.
They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you. And in the end, they are not after me, they're after you. I just happened to be standing in their way, and I will continue to stand in their way. [cheers and applause] I will always be here. I'll be here. I don't know, I'm getting tired of protecting you, but I love it. [laughs] We're going to protect you.
We're going to go. And soon, you won't need protection because, soon, you're going to have a great country again. It's true. You won't need protection. The country will protect you. But think of it. I say this to—I got indicted more than Al Capone, the great Al Capone. Can you imagine? Al Capone, Scarface, the meanest man you've ever met, I have him beat.
But we're pleased to be joined today by some fantastic Pennsylvania patriots, friends of mine, incredible people, starting with the next US senator from the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, David McCormick. He's incredible. He's a—come up. David, come up here. Come. He's a military hero. And honestly, you know, your senator, I don't think I ever met him in four years.
Nobody knows who he is. It's the weirdest thing. It's almost like how they keep getting elected. You got to elect this guy. He's a war hero. He's a national hero. He's a brilliant man. He went out, he made a fortune, and all that stuff. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. It means he's smart, right?
Do we agree? It means he's smart. You guys didn't make that much, but you're very smart anyway. But David has been a friend of mine. He's an incredible man and respected all over the place. And—and, you know, you have one chance to get a guy like this in. A lot of people, after watching my experience, they're not doing this anymore, are they?
So, I'd like to introduce Dave McCormick, a great guy. Hopefully, he's going to be your next senator. You're going to win, and you're going to win big, David.
DAVE MCCORMICK: Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, President Trump. Thank you so much, all of you. And listen, in Pennsylvania, we know, Mr. President, this is the most important election of our lifetime. We know it. And we also know that this is ground zero, which is going to put you back in the White House and the majority in the Senate.
Right here, sir. Right here in Pennsylvania. And I want to welcome you back to Pennsylvania after Butler. We're so glad you're here, sir. Thank you. Thank you for being here. And I want to say what you all know, which is this is an incredibly important choice because we can continue to have the failed horrible policies of Biden, Harris, and Casey, and I say Casey because he votes 98 percent of the time, that destroys our economy: open borders, the fentanyl crisis, crime, the war on fossil fuels.
But it only gets worse. It only gets worse under Harris-Casey. It only gets worse, and that is why we need strong leadership, common sense leadership. And when I go on the campaign trail, Mr. President, the thing I hear that people want most is strength. And I tell them, listen, I'm a combat veteran, I'm an army wrestler.
And when I was standing there in Butler and saw those bullets flying, and I've seen people get shot at before, and you came up and put that fist in the air and said, ""Fight, fight, fight,"" I said to everybody, ""That strength, that's what we need for America. That's why we're going to win on November 5th."" God bless this commonwealth. [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Thank you. Wow. Wow. That's great. You know, David, it is true. David was in Butler, and he was sitting exactly there. And, you know, Corey was sitting right behind him. Can you imagine? Corey was killed. He was sitting right behind David. And David didn't flinch. He didn't move. I mean, some people moved.
Actually, I think it was really known that when bullets are fired in a stadium, everyone really gets moving fast. They call it a stampede. Nobody moved. You looked at the people behind me, right? Everyone seen those people. Those people have become legendary. That was just a small group, the main tens of thousands of people around here, you couldn't even see the end, nobody ran, nobody moved.
They knew I was in trouble. They said, ""He's in trouble."" Every—if you went to a soccer stadium where you'll have a bullet go off, one bullet, the whole place runs for the exits. Nobody ran. And how about the man behind me with the black outfit and the green floppy hat? He's like this. David, did you see him? He's —
CROWD MEMBER: He's right there.
CROWD MEMBER: He's here.
TRUMP: He's staring. He's looking, right? Where? Get up here. Is that him? Yes. Wow. That's great, huh? Well, you're—you can be in a foxhole with me anytime, man. [steps away from podium] Wow. Thank you. That's great. That was a hell of a day, huh?
But there were a number of them back there. They were just brave. Everybody. There was nobody that fled. I think—I think nobody fled, right? They were brave people, and they were looking and they were pointing. They saw it. They were pointing. It was incredible. And one of these crowd control people that came in afterwards said they've never seen it where bullets are fired—and I'll tell you something, David was standing and sitting right—literally, the bullets were going over your head.
They were going over my head, too, the second group. But you weren't a flincher either, were you? You weren't. And Corey right alongside of you, right behind him. And you got to vote for this man. He's a hero and he's a great gentleman. He'll be a great senator. And it's time for a change. It's time for a change.
I mean that. A vote for Dave McCormick is a vote to seal our borders, stop migrant crime, defeat inflation, bring down prices, and defend Pennsylvania energy. You have to defend your energy. They will not allow fracking. As soon as—if they got in, her first move will be to end fracking all throughout the United States.
Dave is running against truly a not-a-good member. I don't like to be disrespectful. He's been there a long time. But Bob Casey is a stiff. He's a stiff. Nobody—nobody knows who the hell he is. I don't think I've ever gone to a meeting where he's been in the meeting, Mike. Mike has been in the meeting. Dan has been in the meeting. Scott is at too many meetings, right?
No, I don't think I've ever been—I don't think I've ever been to a meeting where Casey has even been there, and I've been to a lot of meetings with a lot of senators. But, you know, he just sort of goes along year after year. His father was there. He's there. We want to have a great warrior. Dave, good luck. Good luck. Thank you, David. Vote for him.
We're pleased to be joined today by some really fantastic people. Some, I would say, truly great warriors. And if you could, maybe Congress people, just stand up, right? Just stand up. Scott Perry, Mike Kelly, GT Thompson. GT, hi.
Dan Meuser, Lloyd Smucker. These are unbelievable warriors. These are great fighters. And if you can add David, it's going to be an unbeatable combination. Pennsylvania treasurer—thank you very much, fellas. You've done a great job. You've done a great job. Pennsylvania Treasurer Stacy Garrity, Lancaster County Commissioner Josh Parsons.
Great job, Josh. Jim Worthington, who's a fantastic man. Thank you. Thank you, Jim. Nice to see you. And two people that are amazing, very talented—very talented, very incredible people. One is a spokesman for the—lawyer, by the way, but a great spokesman, truly committed to make America great and me, but truly committed to make America great, which is more important than me, far more important.
I mean, it's just something special. She has been an incredible person going around and—and letting people know how important our country is, how we love our country. Alina Habba. Alina. Stand up, Alina. I didn't know she was going to be here today. [cheers and applause] And another person, one of the most talented writers, a person who truly has the pulse of this area, Pennsylvania, and the Rust Belt, in general—the Rust Belt is her territory.
Nobody covers it better. Salena Zito. Salena. Where are you, Salena? Where are you? Thank you. She's a great—she's a great writer. We're also joined by Tiffany Hall, a single mother of four from Columbia, Pennsylvania who wants to tell us firsthand what the Biden-Harris inflation nightmare has done to her family. It's destroyed her family. Tiffany, please come up. Please. Thank you. Thank you, Tiffany. This is happening all over America because of inflation, by the way. Thanks, Tiffany. Thank you, darling. Go have fun.
[Off-mic] That's OK. Go. Here you go.
TIFFANY HALL: Thank you very much. So, gas prices are just astronomical. Being able to afford anything for my children anymore like sports is just kind of out of the question now. When President Trump was in, I could do these things with them. Since then, I have not been able to. I can't put them into sports. I can't go on extravagant vacations anymore. We can go to free parks around here. I—I miss it. I miss when we didn't have to pull out of our pockets for things. I'm hoping we can get back to a point where I'm financially stable —
TRUMP: You will.
HALL: And others. I know I can't be the only one. We're all going to the gas pump and being like, man, here goes the last of what I have. I don't know. [applause] Thank you.
I would like to be able to go into a grocery store again and not have to put something back or say, ""Nope, we can't do a nice cake from the bakery. We have to try and do one from home."" So, I really hope and pray that we can make America great again and get you back in office. [steps away from podium] Thank you. Thank you.
TRUMP: Wow. Thank you, Tiffany. So, cute. You know, she said, ""Oh, I can't believe it. I left my notes down —"" on her seat. I said just go and wing it, and she did better. You did better than if you had your notes, Tiffany. I have to be honest. That's great. You did better. Thank you. Appreciate it. Things like that happen. I said, ""Well, give it a shot."" She did better.
Starting on day one of the Trump administration, we will end inflation and we will make America great again. We will deliver regulation cuts, energy price cuts, interest rate cuts, and we will drive prices down, and we'll drive them down very fast. We will pass massive tax cuts for workers, and that includes no tax on tips. [cheers and applause]
To protect Pennsylvania jobs, I will revoke China's most favored nation trade status. I will pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act. If China or any other country makes us pay a 100 percent or 200 percent tariff or tax, we will make them pay a reciprocal tariff or tax of 100 percent or 200 percent right back. You hurt us and we hurt you. It's an eye for an eye.
Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the presidency, and it's we win the presidency, I mean that, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled. [cheers and applause] And I am the only one that can say that. I know all the players, and they respect us, they respect me. And they used to respect our country but no longer.
I will prevent World War III. That's where we're heading. We're heading to World War III, and you see it. I will restore peace through strength. Over and over again, our enemies have watched Biden and Harris signal a lack of will, total weakness to do what's necessary to protect American people and stand up for our allies.
A week ago, the prime minister of our closest Middle Eastern ally, Israel, came to address Congress. You saw that. Instead of sending a clear signal that the United States will never abandon an ally, a very important one, Kamala chose to politicize the moment, to grandstand, making a show of refusing to attend.
You know where she was? She went to a sorority party. Can you believe it? Even though it was her duty as president of the Senate to be there. It was her duty to be there. Her Democrat allies fell in line. Chuck Schumer refused to shake the Israeli prime minister's hand. Chuck Schumer has become a Palestinian.
Yes, he has. Can you believe it? He's become a proud member of Hamas. Nancy Pelosi likewise denounced the speech in shameful terms. You know, 15 years ago, Israel had the strongest, most powerful lobby in this country. Now, it's almost the opposite, with AOC plus three and all the people, the enemies of our country in a true sense.
But they are. And the enemies, when they saw all these people abandoned Israel, they took note. And I don't think it's accidental that just four days after Harris and Biden repudiated our Israeli allies, Iran's top terrorist group, Hezbollah, fired an Iranian missile to kill 12 innocent children at a soccer field in northern Israel.
It happened right after he left. With great embarrassment, he left. The terrorists did it because they assumed they could get away with it because the United States is weak and ineffective and no longer respected. We are no longer respected. We are a failing nation. I mean, it's horrible. You don't want to say it. I wish I didn't have to say it. I wish I could say they're doing a phenomenal job.
I wouldn't run. I wouldn't run. I wouldn't have to run. I would be very happy to have somebody do a phenomenal job. I wouldn't have to run, and I'd be very happy with that. I'd be proud of our country. But right now, our country is a joke. It's being laughed at all over the world. The truth is Harris' and Biden's weakness is inviting every rogue enemy worldwide to absolutely get away with murder.
In my next term, we will build a great Iron Dome missile defense shield over our country, a dome like has never been seen before, and it will be entirely made in the USA and right here in Pennsylvania, big sections of it. And I will cut—remember this, I will cut all of the bad talk about Social Security.
They're going to destroy your Social Security, but I will not cut one cent from Social Security or Medicare. And I kept my promise for four years, and I will keep it again. And seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security, and they won't—they won't. There are the people, it's up to you. No tax on Social Security.
By contrast, Kamala cast a tie-breaking vote to cut Medicare, you saw this, by $237 billion in a heartless betrayal of American seniors. We're going to rebuild our cities into beacons of hope, safety, and beauty, better than they have ever been before. We will take over the horribly run capital of our nation in Washington, DC, clean it up, renovate it, fix it, rebuild it. We will again have the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world.
And there will be no crime, no crime allowed, very strong. Right now, you go there, you get mugged, you get shot. On day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto the lives of our children. [cheers and applause]
And I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate. [cheers and applause] And I will keep men out of women's sports. How simple is that? [cheers and applause] I will fully uphold our Second Amendment, as I did for four years. We just got the backing of the NRA, complete and total endorsement from the NRA. We will protect innocent life, and we will restore free speech to our country again.
And very importantly, I will secure our elections. Our goal will be one-day voting with paper ballots, proof of citizenship, voter ID. We're going to do it. We're going to do it. [cheers and applause] A lot of other countries are doing it. The mail-in voting isn't working. It's corrupt. But until then, Republicans must win. We want to have a landslide because the best way to protect against the rigging, and these people know it, is too big to rig.
There's a level at which they can't cheat. So, if you want to save America, get your friends, get your family, get everyone you know and vote, vote early, vote absentee, vote on Election Day. I don't care when you vote, but whatever you do, you have to vote and make sure your ballot counts because these people cheat.
They cheat like dogs. And if you want to help us ensure election integrity, sign up at protectthevote.com, protectthevote.com. And in conclusion, from Easton to Hershey, from Jamestown to Allentown, and from Pittsburgh to right here in beautiful Harrisburg—we love Harrisburg. We got a lot of votes in Harrisburg.
We stand on the shoulders of American legends who poured out their blood, sweat, and tears for our rights and for our freedom. Pennsylvania is where our founding fathers declared American independence. Think of that. Think of the history that this great, great place—it's beautiful. Pennsylvania, think of the history that you have.
It's where the Army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge where General George Washington—we're never taking his name off any buildings. They'd like to. When they want to take Washington, Lincoln, and Jefferson off, it ain't gonna happen. But it will happen under her. George Washington led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware and where the union was saved by the immortal heroes at Gettysburg.
Gettysburg. Wow. [cheers and applause] Gettysburg. And this is the state where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania miners and steelworkers forged the greatest nation in the history of the world. But now, we are a nation in serious decline. We are a failing nation. We are a nation that has lost its confidence, lost its willpower, and lost its strength.
We are a nation that has lost quite simply its way. But we are not going to allow this horror to continue. Less than four years ago, we were a great nation. And we will soon be a great nation again. [cheers and applause] Soon be. With our leadership, every disaster Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have created can be fixed and be quick—very quickly.
We're going to do it so quickly. Remember, I used to tell the story, we're going to win, win, win, right? We're going to win so much; you're going to get tired of winning. We're going to win. We're going to start winning. ""Please, please, Mr. President, we're winning too much. We can't take it anymore."" We're going to win, win, win.
Every problem can be solved and every wrong can be rectified. By this time next year, America's borders will be strong, sealed, and secure. Inflation will be a full thing of the past. It will be in full retreat. Our economy will be roaring back. Optimism will be surging. The American dream will be thriving again for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.
Law and justice will reign all throughout our land. Freedom will be restored. The flame of liberty will be burning bright. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, the worst administration in the history of our country, will be a fading memory of the past. And our great silent majority, including the once-forgotten men and women of our country, will be the ones shaping America's magnificent future when I am the 47th president of the United States because we are all Americans; and together, we will show November 5th to be the most important day in the history of our country.
We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America powerful again, make America wealthy again, make America strong again, make America proud again, make America safe again, make America free again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Pennsylvania.
God bless you. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everybody.

    [music: Village People, YMCA.]
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next President of the United States, President Donald J. Trump.
[music: Lee Greenwood, God Bless the USA.]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Thank you very much, Pennsylvania. I love Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you. I really give a very big hello to Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause]
It's great to be back in this beautiful Commonwealth with thousands of proud, hard-working American patriots, which is what you are. Think of this. Who would believe this? 80 days from now, we are going to defeat a communist known as Kamala Harris, the most radical left person ever to run for office. This is not what this country needs. We've had enough of them. We're going to win back the White House and we're going to take back our country. [cheers and applause]
Kamala Harris is a super-left liberal who ruined San Francisco, ruined California [booing] and delivered a badly broken economy, a badly broken border, which gave us a dangerous world of chaos, death, and destruction. Just take a look at what's happening today. We were a respected country. Now the whole world laughs at us. We're a bunch of foolish people to have allowed this to happen, but we're going to bring it back. We're going to bring it back very fast.
We'll close up the borders. We'll drill, baby drill. [cheers and applause]
We're going to do things that are going to be very good, very good, very fast. It'll happen very quickly, but she breaks everything that she touches. But soon we're going to fix every single problem Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, Crooked Joe have—what happened to Biden? I was running against Biden. All of a sudden I'm running against somebody else. It's true. You know, it's interesting.
I said, ""Who am I running against?""
""Harris.""
I said, ""Who the hell is Harris?""
""You don't know. Who the hell is Harris?"" [laughter]
She was the first one out last time. She was the first one to lose, and now all of a sudden she's running. She never got a vote. They are a threat to democracy, remember that.
Starting the day I take the Oath of Office, I will rapidly drive prices down and we will make America affordable again. [cheers and applause] We're going to make it affordable again. Under Kamala Harris and crooked Joe Biden, the American dream was dead and it is dead. It's dead as a doornail. They'll never bring it back unless we win. If we win, we're going to have the American dream alive. [cheers and applause]
All for your beautiful children, your grandchildren, we'll have the American dream, will be back with us. [cheers and applause] Her radical liberal policies, of course, horrific inflation decimated the middle class and gutted the finances of millions of American families. And you know what I'm talking about because everybody in this room has been devastated by what they've done. They have no idea. They're grossly incompetent people.
Real incomes are down by over $2,000 a year. Think of that. Minimum. And ours, up five times that amount, more than five times that amount. Her price hikes have cost a typical household a total of $28,000, and that's called the Kamala Harris Inflation Tax.
She was there for everything. You know when she sits and complains,—hey, look, look,—Joe Biden hates her, okay, hates her. You don't mind if I go off teleprompter for a second, do you? [cheers and applause] Joe Biden hates her.
This was an overthrow of a president. This was an overthrow. They went out and I spent a hundred million dollars fighting Joe Biden. They told him he couldn't win. His debate performance wasn't the best ever, [laughter] but they said mine was the best ever. But they said his debate performance wasn't. I look forward to debating her, by the way. She'll be easier, she'll be easier than him. [cheers] Her policies are so bad. Her policy, remember her father was a Marxist economic professor. He was a Marxist, an avowed Marxist. This is not what we want in this country. And think of it. Does anyone here feel richer under Kamala Harris and Crooked Joe?
CROWD: NO
TRUMP: Is anything less expensive under Kamala Harris or Crooked Joe?
CROWD: NO
TRUMP: No, no. It's been devastating. Inflation. Inflation has been devastating under this group of people that have no idea what the hell they're doing.
Are you better off with Kamala and Biden than you were under President Donald J. Trump? I don't think so. They do polls and this stuff and I'm at like 93%. I said, ""Why are we having an election? They didn't have an election. Why are we having an election?""
How would you like to be Biden? He's working. He's spending money. He's trying. They wanted to have a debate. That's the thing that started it all. If I didn't debate him, he'd still be running right now. But I believe she will be easier to beat than him—[cheers and applause] because she's a truly radical left lunatic.
And with him, he never really believed it. Of course, I don't know if he knew anything. I am not sure. But he didn't really believe it. She totally believes it. She wants to destroy our country.
With four more years of Kamala, your finances will never recover. They will only get worse. They're only going to get worse. The stock market, and we have some of the most brilliant people on Wall Street saying the stock market is only up because they think I'm going to win and if we don't win, according to many people, including one of the greatest Wall Street prognosticators, Scott Bessent—has anyone heard of him? One of the most brilliant guys on Wall Street, if I don't win, you will have a 1929 style depression. Enjoy it. I believe that. I believe that. I believe it. A lot of people believe it, so we're not going to give them the chance, okay? We're not going to give them.
And your state's going to be ruined anyway, she's totally anti-fracking. She's been anti- fracking and anti-drilling, anti-oil and gas from practically the day she was born. All of a sudden a couple of months ago, she said, ""Oh, I'd love to have fracking."" No, she won't have fracking.
Vote Trump and your incomes will soar. Your savings will grow. Young people will be able to afford a home,—[cheers] and we will bring back the American dream bigger. [cheers and applause] We are going to bring it back. Bigger, better front-row Joe. Bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. We're going to bring it back. Look at all these front-row Joes over here. They've only been, we have a couple of groups here. They're at about 222 events. Front-Row Joes, stand up, wave your hands, there, you guys are great. Patriots. [cheers and applause]
But I have another group from a place called North Carolina. Has anybody ever heard of North? We love North Carolina. The beautiful ladies over there. This is number, what? 217, so this is number 217, and supposedly they're happily married. How the hell does that work? Look at them. [gestures towards crowd member] They're beautiful and they, oh, there's a husband. Are you a husband? Who are you married to husband? Oh, that was a wise choice. Beautiful. Very nice.
How do you handle it, right? How do you handle? But they're great women and they've been with us from the very beginning. [cheers and applause] They were with us from the beginning in 2016 when we had the four greatest years this country has ever had. They were with us then. Thank you very much.
North Carolina. We're doing well in North Carolina. Thank you, darling. It's nice to not have to travel to California and other places, right?
Yesterday, Kamala laid out her so-called economic plan. She says she's going to lower the cost of food and housing starting on day one, but day one for Kamala was three and a half years ago so why didn't she do it then? [cheers]
This is day 1,305. We're at 1,305. So why isn't she doing it now? Why doesn't she get away from her nice little place with her wonderful husband, go to Washington and do it now? You could do it right now.
Why does she go to the convention? Because it's a rigged convention, obviously. She got no votes. He had 14,—you know—sleepy Joe had 14 million votes. She got no votes. She failed. She was the first one out. She failed. She never got to Iowa. Great state, Iowa. We're going to win it big. The farmers love Trump and I love the farmers, but she never got to Iowa. She was the first one to quit and now she's running for president. —I don't know—.
Somebody's going to have to explain our system to our many enemies all around the world. They're watching, they're saying, ""This place doesn't make a lot of sense anymore.""
Everything Kamala Harris says in her speeches is a lie. She gets up and just lies. I was watching her yesterday. She talked about all the taxes I was going to raise. I never said that. I'm lowering taxes.
Yesterday she got up. She started ranting and raving that Donald Trump wants to put a tax on gasoline, a tax on food, a tax on medication, a tax on clothing, a tax on every single thing that was ever invented. Your hat, he's going to tax. Your shirt, he is going to tax. He's going to tax your wife; he's going to tax your husband. And I'm saying, I never said any of that. They make it up.
Here's the truth. Kamala wants to put massive taxes on American jobs and American industries. I want to cut taxes on Americans while putting tariffs on China and foreign countries to bring our jobs back home to Pennsylvania and to take in billions and billions of dollars. [cheers and applause]
I'm the only one that ever took in any money from China. China was really hitting us hard, ripping us apart, that means many, many presidents. And what happened is I put a tariff on then I raised the tariff. We took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China and—Biden gets so much money; he's trying to rescind it for a couple of reasons.
Number one, he got a lot of money from China. Didn't he get three and a half million, 4 million that they know of? But he got a lot more than that. His family made a lot of money with China. He wants to get rid of the tariff, but he can't because there's so much money they can't do anything with the budget. A tariff is a tax on a foreign country. That's the way it is, whether you like it or not. A lot of people like to say it's a tax on us. No, no, no. It's a tax on a foreign country.
It's a tax on a country that's ripping us off and stealing our jobs and it's a tax that doesn't affect our country. [cheers] And you could see hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs on other countries also. I took in hundreds of billions and nothing happened to us.
They make less money. And you know what? Our jobs come back because there's no tax if they build their factory in Pennsylvania, there's no tax if they build their factory in the United States. So what do they do in order to avoid paying the tax? They say, ""Let's build a place over here. No tax."" Come on over. We love it. Just hire our people. That's all you have to do. It's very simple.
As we speak, and this really goes to Michigan more than you, but I look at Michigan and South Carolina, a lot of other places that do the auto stuff, and they are building some of the biggest auto factories in the world right now in Mexico, right off our border. They think they're going to make cars, not pay any tax and sell those cars into the United States. Not going to happen. Not with me.
They're building some of the biggest auto plants in the world. And you know who owns those auto plants? They're built. They're made and being built in Mexico. You know who owns them? China owns them.
China's very smart. I had a good relationship with President Xi. When Covid came, that was the end of that relationship. But I had a very good relationship. But we took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China. Think of it, Bush, Barack Hussein—did you ever hear of Barack Hussein Obama? [booing] Have you heard of her? [booing]
There are those that think he is currently running the country. Does anybody think? [booing] I don't know. I don't know that that's true. We know it's not Biden.
Every attack Kamala makes on us is a fabricated, it's a lie. She's a bad storyteller. She doesn't know how to tell a story very well, but she gets caught, she got caught up in her own words. She's not a very good wordsmith they say. I don't know. We're going to find out.
We're going to have a debate at some point. They gave me—the worst network to me is ABC, worse than NBC, worse than CBS, worse than CNN. The home of George Stephanopoulos, —a nasty guy. I said, ""George, I've had you up to here."" It's true. He's a nasty guy. The hatred. And yet when he interviews Biden, two weeks ago, he interviewed Biden, it was like the nicest interview. ""What flavor ice cream do you like?"" ""George, I tend to vanilla very much."" [laughter]
With me they get into a lot of subjects that a lot of people don't like talking about. But ABC is the worst. And that seems because they won't do it on Fox. They've turned down the Fox. I've approved three debates. They've approved one. The only one they've approved was their network.
And now it came out in the New York Times of all places that the head of the news and the head of the whole thing practically is Kamala and her husband, lovely husband, best friend, her and her husband are best friends with Kamala and her husband. And I'm supposed to do the debate.
But with Biden, they thought I wouldn't do it so they offered me something that I couldn't accept. They said, ""The debate is at CNN in front of no audience."" So far, I'm oh for two. And see, they didn't want to do the debate. That would've been a good idea if they didn't do it, but I was going to accept anything. Then I guess we'll do it here too, right? We'll accept anything because otherwise she's not going to debate.
She doesn't want to debate, but they said, ""CNN and no audience, and we want to have you sit down."" I objected to that. They wanted us sitting behind the desk. I said, ""Give me a break. We have to at least stand for the American public."" Wouldn't that be nice? [cheers and applause]
That was the only thing, and I would've done it if they insisted. No, I would've sat down if they insisted. But I thought it was sort of a little strange. But I had Dana Bash and I had Jake Tapper. But I have to tell you, they were very fair. I really thought they were very fair.
Jake and Dana, nobody knows how to say her first name. Is it Dana or Dana? Nobody knows. It's been going on for 20 years. She's been around a long time. Is it Dana or Dana? And now the fake news will say, ""Trump didn't know how to pronounce her first name."" She doesn't know how to pronounce, but look, but Dana and Jake, I used to call him Fake Tapper. Now I call him Jake Tapper because he treated us very fairly and so did Dana treat me very fairly.
I think it was just about neutral. But he kept saying—he gave very short answers because he wasn't really doing too well. And I kept saying, ""I'll take it."" But what happened? ""Sir, you have 92 seconds left."" This is not what he wanted to hear. [gestures to David McCormick] Right, David?
They said, ""You have 92 seconds left,"" going to be your next senator I'll tell you, David McCormick. [cheers and applause] I hope you can vote for him. I hope you vote for him.
I hope you vote for him. He is a great gentleman, great hero actually in many ways. He's a great guy.
But so they gave me this thing and they assumed I was going to turn it down so I have the wrong network. I have the wrong anchors. I have no audience. I like an audience. I love people. [cheers and applause]
It's oftentimes a mistake.
Everything was wrong. So what we'll do is we'll offer him this thing that he can't accept. He won't accept it. And then we'll say, ""Trump didn't accept the debate. He's afraid to negotiate against Biden because Biden is so sharp. He's so sharp. He's sharp like a razor.""
But I surprised them. I said, ""I'll take it. I'll take it."" And people said, ""Are you crazy?"" I said, ""Look, it's the only way you're going to debate. If we do anything else, they're not going to accept it."" And these people are the same way. They offered me – we, we were supposed to have Fox on September 4th. And they said, ""No."" I accepted it. I don't even know what's going to happen because I've accepted it. They haven't. So maybe they show up, maybe they don't. But I think it's sort of on for September 4th, but I don't think they're going to come. And then we go and we do the debate with ABC.
ABC, again, I call it ABC Fake News, so bad. They're so bad. They're so dishonest, in my opinion. Very dishonest people. But I find them to be the worst. And I really am a professional at this because I watch the—who treats me the worst?
Now, NBC is horrible. CBS is horrible. They're all horrible. These are horrible human beings. But who treats me the worst? ABC Fake News treats me the worst. And that's where they want it.
Where her best friend—it just came out the other day. Nobody told anybody about this, is the head of the whole deal, right? But I'll probably say, ""I'll take it"" because you know what they're not going to do a debate? But just remember, these are phony, fake, disgusting people that hate our country. [cheers]
Remember that. And also remember that every attack that we make on Kamala is something that she said on tape or something that she's actually done. All of these attacks are things because she said all of it. She said, ""I don't want fracking in Pennsylvania."" She said it hundreds of times. ""I don't want it anywhere,"" then a couple of months ago, when the polls are showing that she's getting clobbered, well actually, nobody actually thought they were politically correct. They wanted to be politically correct because they wanted, they had 11 different people and they put her name in to be number 12, and they had a vote. She came in last.
So she picked somebody, think of it, how about the guy she picked, how bad is he, right? How bad is that guy? David, where do these people come from? [cheers and applause]
He recently signed a bill in a state that I love, but a state that hasn't been won by a Republican because it's a corrupt state, but the people are not corrupt. The people are great. Since 1972 hasn't been won. And I thought we won it twice, I said, ""There's no way we lose Minnesota."" But he signed a bill for all young men's bathrooms and men's bathrooms, have to be equipped with a tampon-selling machine. [booing] And she turned down, your governor, by the way, just so you understand, I know some of you probably like him. [booing] I don't think he's a good person. I don't think he's good. I don't think he's good. But they turned him down because he's Jewish. Okay. That's why they turned him down.
Now we can be politically correct and not say that. I could say, ""Well, they turned him down for various reasons."" No, no. They turned him down because he's Jewish, that's why they turned him down. And I'll tell you this, any Jewish person that votes for her or a Democrat has to go out and have their head examined because if you see what's happening with Israel and Jewish people right now, there has never been a more dangerous time since the Holocaust. If you happen to be Jewish in America, there's never been anything like it.
I'm seeing things, I can't even believe it, and we want to bring about unity and peace and everything else. It looks like they're going to have nothing but riots out there in Chicago. It's really a sad thing. But they turned him down for that reason and they turned him down for a couple of other reasons too. But the primary reason was that he's Jewish.
And you don't think I know what goes on in their campaign. I know it well. I know it very well. She's a nation-wrecker who is more liberal than crazy Bernie Sanders. You know Crazy Bernie. He's pretty bad, right? She is substantially more radicalized than Crazy Bernie.
You cannot have her as your president. She ruined San Francisco. She ruined the state of California. No, she was a district attorney, and she was the attorney general of the state.
I heard the other day, and this isn't anything, I'm just saying—they'll say, ""He was rambling."" I don't ramble. I'm really smart guy, really smart. I don't ramble. But the other day, anytime I hit too hard, they say he was rambling. Rambling? I get up and I make a speech. I go for sometimes two hours, two and a half hours, because people are waiting outside for three days, four days. You guys were waiting out there for a long time. Front row Joes are waiting out—I don't know how you guys do it. And I feel I have an obligation to speak, and speak in a certain way, and speak a little bit longer.
You know? How would you like it? A guy's waiting with his family for three and a half, four days. They have a tent, and the tent is set up. They have hundreds of them, and they wait. And then I walk in, speak for 15 minutes, and leave. I don't know, somehow, would that be okay, North Carolina? I don't think so, right?
CROWD: NO
TRUMP: They want me to speak all day. When I leave, I did one, two hours and 15 minutes, and I'm leaving, and they're screaming, ""No, sir, more! We want to hear more!"" I said, ""I can't!"" I said, ""I can't speak more! What the hell else am I going to say? Our country's going to hell. That's all I can say. We're a nation in decline.""
You know we were talking about that before. My phrases are copied so much, right? I use the term, oftentimes in closing, ""We are a nation in decline. We are a failed nation."" And I think it's a beautiful phrase, although I don't like the topic very much, I don't like what it represents, but there's a certain beauty.
All of a sudden, all of these candidates, including Republicans, are saying, ""We are a nation in decline. We are a failing nation."" And I say, You know, what the hell do they have to copy me for? Right?
But they have a lot of words that they copy, many of our words.
We were in the plane before coming in, and our people said—we went through a list. I think we're going to release a list. Let's release it. But so many of our phrases, they copy. Really, that should be a nice thing. Not an insult.
But crazy Bernie Sanders has said a lot of things, and one of the things he's arguing about is who's more liberal. And after about two minutes, he gave up. He said, ""This woman is nuts.""
Look, people say be nice. Have you heard her laugh? That is the laugh of a crazy person. That is the laugh of a crazy. It's the laugh of a lunatic. [cheers and applause] Have you heard it? You know, they prohibited her. They prohibited her for laughing. I've been waiting for her to laugh, because as soon as she laughs, the election's over. But we're winning by a lot in Pennsylvania. I think the fracking got her. [cheers and applause] The fracking got her.
But she has been prohibited from laughing. She used to do an interview, she'd go ha-ha-ha. Who the hell laughs at an interview like that? I'm interviewed all the time, I may smile. They're asking you questions about things that—It's not like a comedy club. And she'd break out. That's one of the reasons she refuses to do interviews, I think, because she laughs, it's so horrible. No, it's so horrible.
But you know she hasn't done an interview in 30 days or something like that? And I do one every day. If I pass—I just did one backstage. [cheers and applause] I just did one backstage with a very good reporter. But you're supposed to. Don't you sort of have an obligation? You know you're running. They're going to try. This is her form of the basement.
Now, the basement for him was good because they had COVID, they didn't want him to catch COVID, he ended up catching it anyway. But uh the whole system is very dishonest, but she should be at least talking to the press. She hasn't done anything.
But she's prohibited from laughing. They said, ""Your laugh is horrible. Never laugh, ever."" So, she's walking around with her mouth almost sealed shut. She won't laugh. I want her to laugh! And then we'll just claim victory. Ladies and gentlemen, like to thank you very much. But we have a little video that we just put up. Would you like to see it?
CROWD: YES
TRUMP: Go ahead. Just one.
KAMALA HARRIS [montage of clips from Harris's statements]: Yeah, I am a radical. You need to get radical about what we're doing, and take it seriously. As president of the United States, I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster to pass a Green New Deal. There's no question, I'm in favor of banning fracking. We have to have a buyback program, and I support a mandatory buyback program.
JAKE TAPPER: I believe it will totally eliminate private insurance.
HARRIS: Let's eliminate all of that.
ERIN BURNETT: But would you support changing the dietary guidelines?
HARRIS: Yes.
BURNETT: You know, the food pyramid?
HARRIS: Yes.
BURNETT: To reduce red meat specifically?
HARRIS: Yes, I would.
INTERVIEWER 1: Raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.
EBRO DARDEN: Where do you stand on defund the police?
HARRIS: This whole movement is about rightly saying we need to take a look at these budgets.
UNNAMED COMMENTATOR 1: Harris asserted that ICE is perceived as the modern day Ku Klux Klan.
HARRIS: Are you aware that there's a perception-
UNNAMED SPEAKER 1: I see no-
HARRIS: Are you aware that there's a perception—
SPEAKER 1: —perception that puts ICE in the same category as the KKK. Is that where you're asking me? I see no parallel.
HARRIS: I'm not finished.
SPEAKER 1: I see none.
HARRIS: Maybe I am a radical. We need to get radical about what we are doing.
CROWD: BOO
TRUMP: Now, over the years, and right up until the present, she wanted to openly defund the police. How do you like that?
CROWD: BOO
TRUMP: In Minnesota, when they were burning down the state, and in particular Minneapolis, they were burning it down. Remember the CNN fake reporter? He got up—the one with the nice, shaved head, he got up. ""This is a peaceful rally. This is a rally of love."" Behind him, the entire city was burning. It looked like World War II, right?
And by the way, speaking of World War II, she will bring us into World War III, and it will be—that'll be a war like never before, because of the weaponry. No more army tanks going back and forth shooting.
We've left a lot of our – you know, I rebuilt the entire military, and we left a lot of that in a place called Afghanistan. You know that? Billions and billions of dollars, we left it. In the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, we left billions of dollars. 13 great soldiers killed. Think of it. Left many hostages. Many people have been left behind. But think of what happened there. We got out in disgrace. We should have gotten out with strength. I was getting out. We would've been out even sooner, but strength, dignity, we would've kept Bagram.
The big air base. You know who occupies Bagram right now? China. Because it was one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons. Not because of Afghanistan, but because of China. But China occupies it right now. Thank you very much, President Xi, enjoy our billions of dollars of construction that took place years ago. They spent billions of dollars many years ago. One hour away, think of that, where they make their nuclear weapons. It's so embarrassing, the stupidity of the people that have run our country. But we did things the opposite way. We were very smart, we were very respected, we were a respected country. They respected your leader, elected leader.
But remember this. Viktor Orban of Hungary, prime minister of Hungary, they asked him pretty recently, they said, ""What's going on? The world is coming to an end."" He said, ""If you want to stop it, reelect—the United States, reelect Donald Trump. [cheers and applause] Because when he was there, he didn't have any problems. We didn't have problems."" Russia wouldn't have happened with Ukraine. Israel would've never been attacked on October 7th, never.
You know Iran was broke? Iran was broke. They had no money. I told China, ""You buy oil from them, you can't deal with us."" I told that to many countries, anybody that dealt there, so they didn't buy oil. Oil's the whole thing, the big deal. And they were broke. Now they have $3 billion, think of it. They have $300 billion now, they have plenty of money.
We're run by stupid people, and we have to change it, or we're not going to have a country left. We didn't let countries take advantage of us. France was going to charge our corporations tremendous amounts of money for doing business in France. You know this, David. David is very familiar with what happened. And I went to my people. I said, ""Tell them we're not going to put up with it. They're not going to charge our companies, because we want our companies to do well so they can employ people."" It's sort of simple.
I didn't even like a lot of the companies that they were dealing with. I should have said, ""Oh, great, let them charge. What the hell do I care?"" But they're American companies. And I said to Macron, I said, ""Call him, because my people failed to make a deal."" I said, ""You make a deal, you have one week. Come see me.""
At the end of a week, they came to see me. Good people, smart people, very smart people. Secretary of Treasury, smart guy, Mnuchin, others. They came back to see me.
""Sir, we're not able to make a deal. They're going to charge our companies a tax.""
I said, ""No, no, they're not going to do it. You don't understand. They're not going to do it. Come back and see me. You have one more day.""
They came back, ""Sir, they won't do it. They've already passed it in their so-called legislature. We're not going to do it. They're not going to be able to stop it, sir.""
I said, ""We'll stop it. Get Emmanuel Macron on the phone.""
I got him on the phone. ""Emmanuel, how are you? So nice to talk.""
""Oh, Donald, Donald, it is so nice to speak to you."" It's beautiful. I wish I had his accent; I would've been president 20 years ago.
But I said, ""Emmanuel, I understand you're charging our companies a lot of money?"" ""Oh, well, this has been in the works for many years, you know Donald. Yes, it is done, it is really done. There's nothing we can do about it.""
I said, ""Okay, good. Emmanuel, here's the story. If you don't get rid of that tax within 24 hours, starting on Monday morning,"" it was a Friday, ""I'm going to charge every bottle of wine and champagne that you send into our country. I'm going to charge you a tariff of 100% on every bottle, and you will not be sending too many bottles of champagne."" [cheers and applause]
And he said, ""Donald, Donald, that is not fair. That is not fair.""
I said, ""No, no. It's not fair for you to be charging American companies to do business in your country. No, it's not fair, Emmanuel. Emmanuel, get back to me in five minutes and let me know.""
He called me back in two minutes.
He said, ""Donald, we have decided that we will not be charging you any taxes for the American companies."" [cheers and applause]
I did so many of them. I did so many. I could stand up here all day and tell you different stories. I just used the telephone. I could stop the war with a telephone. I could stop what's happening in the Middle East with a couple of telephone calls, properly placed. [cheers and applause] Horrible. Horrible, horrible, horrible. We have people that are babies. In many ways, I guess they're stupid. People say, ""Please don't use bad language! Please don't call people stupid!"" They're stupid people. How else do you describe it? I want to use a different word, highly—a more sophisticated word than stupid, but there's no word. It's a perfect word. They're stupid people. I think they're also, by the way, if I might, they're also corrupt. They really are, they're corrupt. They get a lot of money from a lot of people.
We're not going to let this socialist lunatic—and she's a socialist lunatic. That's the other thing. ""Please, sir. Please don't call her a lunatic."" I said, ""But that's what she is."" She's a lunatic. [cheers and applause] She's a lunatic. She's going to destroy our country.
And she's going to break our economy even more than it's broken. We have a broken economy. Our supply chain is gone.
You order something now, I don't know how many of you are in business, or even if you're ordering as a personal order, the order doesn't come. The supply chain is broken. Whoever thought of it, we never even talked about supply chain. Supply chain just worked. And because of what they've done, they've broken our supply chain.
On election day, we're going to tell her that we've had enough. We said, ""Kamala, you're a horrible vice president, you're going to be a horrible president. We're not going to take it anymore. KAMALA, you're fired! Get out of there! You're fired!"" [cheers and applause]
Not going to take it anymore, Kamala. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: We're not going to take it anymore. We have a country to save. And how about the fake news? [gestures towards media] Oh, look at them all back here, look at all those cameras. [booing]
TRUMP: Look at all those cameras. Wow. Look at all those cameras, all those fake writers. Look at them. [booing]
Time Magazine, think of this. Time Magazine doesn't have a picture of her. They have this unbelievable artist drawing her. And I said, ""Is that Sophia Loren?"" I couldn't—who might that be? Is that Elizabeth Taylor? They say she was a beautiful woman. Who is it? It's so beautiful. Drawing. It's a drawing. They took a lot of pictures, it didn't work out, so they hired a sketch artist.
I said, ""I'm sure, oh, they must be celebrating the great life and times of the magnificently beautiful Sophia Loren."" And you're not allowed to say this anymore. You know, David, don't ever get caught in this trap, David, please. Don't ever call a woman beautiful, because that'll be the end of your political career. Please. I want to make your life much easier, David. By the way, he's also got a great wife, I have to say, he's got a great wife. [applause]
But you know, I read a so-called Republican, who Ronald Reagan didn't like, by the way, and she didn't like him, but she got credit for being this Reagan speech writer. Highly overrated. I don't know anything about her, I don't know her. Treats me badly, but that's okay. She called it wrong. She's called it wrong now for about eight years. But she said one thing that got me. She said Kamala has one big advantage. She's a very beautiful woman. [laughter]
CROWD: BOO
TRUMP: She's a beautiful woman. So, I decided to go back and reread the clause. ""I'm not saying he's —"" but I say that I am much better looking than her. [cheers and applause] I think I'm much better, much better. I'm a better looking person than Kamala! No, I couldn't believe it. I had never heard that one. They said, ""No, her biggest advantage is that she's a beautiful woman."" I'm going, ""Huh."" I never thought of that. I'm better looking than she is. [cheers]
In her speech yesterday, Kamala went full communist. You heard that? She went full communist. She wants to destroy our country. After causing catastrophic inflation, Comrade Kamala announced that she wants to institute socialist price controls. You saw that? Never worked before. Never ever worked.
This is the Maduro plan. Venezuela Maduro plan of the old Soviet Union. They tried it. How did the Soviet Union work out? It became Russia, smaller version. It was a smaller version. It will cause rationing, hunger, and skyrocketing prices, just like their Inflation Reduction Act caused. One of the great scams of all time.
They got it approved with a beautiful name: Inflation Reduction. Because inflation, under their system, has been so bad. It's gone up much more than 50%. They say, ""30, 40, 50."" Much more. People are being devastated. They're being devastated. But it's gone way up, way up. And they made a big mistake yesterday in her speech. I think she said, I had to play it back. I love the playback controls you have nowadays. They used to call it TiVo, now they have TiVo, all the—I think it's the single greatest invention. It's better than television, because television would drive you crazy if you couldn't do a playback, right? Now I can playback. I heard the statement, and I heard that statement that she made, and she made a statement yesterday that, from her time in office, essentially, prices have gone up by 50%, something like—I said, ""Did she just say that?"" I said, ""That speech writer is going to be fired."" In fact, we took that section and we actually made a commercial on it, and we got the best commercial of the week, and we didn't do anything. We just played her back.
But here's the problem. The things that she said yesterday don't work. They have never worked. They've never been used. Many times before, in many other countries, they've never worked. They've just never worked. They've been used oftentimes, many countries, and in every single event, it ruined those countries. It's a communist system.
It's what her father, a Marxist, he was a Marxist, it's what her father taught her, from a young girl growing up. She's promising to hand out things she can't deliver. She can never deliver them; she'll never get them approved. Just like when she and Crooked Joe tried to give away student debt. Remember? She wanted to pay. How did that work out? Not too good. The students are saying, ""I love him because of student debt."" But he got rejected.
And this will be rejected even more so because what they're doing is a communist takeover of our country. Her plan is very dangerous, because it may sound good politically, and that's the problem. And we have to be very careful, because when somebody gets up and says, ""We're going to give you everything: $25,000 for a house, we're going to give you all sorts of little goodies, free healthcare, we're going to give you everything, universal healthcare."" Sounds so beautiful.
And I told my people, you got to be very careful. I told the Republican Party; you have to be very careful. She's giving all this away, and somebody that really isn't into it. We're largely, even groups like this, we're into it. We think about it all the time. We want to take back our country. We want to save our country.
And you understand how bad this stuff is? This is communist, this is Marxist, this is fascist. But you know what? It's dangerous because she's saying that she's going to give away things that she'll never be able to get approved.
She wants to increase the number of justices on the United States Supreme Court to 27. 27.[booing] I used to hear she was going up to 11, and then I heard it was 13. But then they said that's an unlucky number, so they went to 15. Yesterday for the first time, I heard 27. We'll have to rebuild the entire Supreme Court, because they won't have enough room for the judges. They won't have enough—.
And by the way, how courageous were our justices of the United States Supreme Court? [cheers and applause] What they did, they're saving our country. They're actually saving our country. What they've done is they've passed things that were so important, and they did it for the right, not for the wrong. They did the right thing. They did the right thing. And I just have such respect for them. The job they've done against—and the radical left plays the ref.
You know the great Bobby Knight? He supported me. He used to fight with the referees all the time. Scream at them.
""Bobby, Bobby, please don't do that. It's not going to work.""
He said, ""You're right, it's not going to work now; it's going to work for the next one.""
And the next call, there'd be a flagrant foul and they wouldn't call it. They didn't want to get screamed at.
The radical left harasses our judges, and harasses our justices. They scream at them. They call them names. They say they're incompetent. They're horrible. They're this, they're that. They should be impeached. They're constantly saying they should be impeached. But they're screaming. And you know what?
It has an effect on some people. But so far, they've been very strong. It's really horrible. I believe it's illegal, what they do. And I'm trying to give you things that you've never heard before, and this is true. I believe they are playing the ref. They're constantly criticizing our great, some of our greatest, justices, and a lot of great judges.
I kept hearing so much about the Florida case, because you know they weaponized our system. Our government totally weaponized it. First time it's ever happened. And they said my biggest case is in Florida, Florida, Florida. We had a very brilliant, I don't know the judge, but a fair and very brilliant judge, who took tremendous abuse. Would've been so easy for her to just rule against me. But she didn't do that. She ruled for—threw out the whole case. [cheers and applause] It was thrown out. That was a big case. And I have such respect for her because she is, in fact, brilliant. But they were hitting her so hard.
""She's going too slow. She's not, she should be removed immediately from office.""
These people are horrible. I really think it's illegal, what they do with judges and justices. They're playing the ref. No different than Bobby Knight. And he was great.
He endorsed me, and Indiana was mine, he was a great coach. He's the last coach to go undefeated. I guess he was like 38—. For some reason, they've never had another college team since then. That was many years ago. And he came out in favor of Donald Trump, and it was a big thing. I won Indiana by a landslide. Because when Bobby Knight from Indiana endorses you, you win. [cheers]
Sort of like when I endorse you, you win too. We have a very good record of endorsement.
But we can't let these radical left thugs constantly scream at our judges and say, ""We're going to impeach him. We're going to take him out of office."" Or her. ""We're going to do horrible things to him."" Continuous.
When you heard Schumer get up on the stairs of the courthouse, Supreme Court, and talk about Kavanaugh, ""We're going to get you, Kavanaugh. We're going to hit you."" Or whatever the hell he said. If a mobster said that, they'd be put in jail immediately. He frankly should have been put in jail, or certainly spoken to very strongly. [cheers and applause] He got lucky. He got lucky. He had a couple of guys that didn't want to do it, and I understand that also. But he got lucky. But we can't let them do that.
And I just want to pay my respect to the judges that have suffered abuse at the hands of the radical left lunatics. And I really admire them for—because you know what? All they have to do to end it is rule against me or whatever it is. If they say, ""Trump, you're guilty."" Oh, now all of a sudden they say, ""Oh."" That's the last time they ever say a bad—but they can't do it, because these people have weaponized the Justice Department, including local DAs and local attorney generals.
And Fani, Fani. You know Fani? Spelled F-A-N-I. ""My name is Fani, F-A-N-I."" I don't figure it. She put a little French accent on the word with her lover, Wade. Right? Lover Wade, we call him, Lover Boy Wade. She hired and paid him almost a million dollars because of his great knowledge of the law. He never did it before.
With us today is Daniel Campos, a pilot in Venezuela who now lives in Pennsylvania. Great gentleman. Daniel came to tell us what you think of Kamala Harris leading our country into socialism. We're being led into socialism, but the socialism will be short-lived. It's going into communism.
If you would've told me, and if you remember many times during State of the Unions, I would say, ""We will never have a socialist country."" And everybody would applaud.
But I was right because we're really, I think, skipping socialism. We're going into communism. When they weaponize our government like this, that's what they do in Third World countries. That's what they do in South American horror shows. That's what they do in banana republics. They've weaponized it.
But I believe ours is even more corrupt. The New York court system is totally corrupt. They use the state and the city to go after me. They take top people in the Department of Justice and put them in.
The Attorney General Leticia James, she campaigned, and, ""I will get Trump!"" And they then go there, and then they go into the Manhattan DA's office. They use Hillary Clinton's lawyer and the Democrats' law firm to leave the firm and go into the DA's office in order to prosecute Donald Trump, free of charge. They're not going to charge.
Then he writes a book, this guy writes a book, before the thing even went anywhere. And in the book he said, ""I do it for free, it's so great."" These are corrupt people, and we have to call them out. So, remember the term, playing the ref with our judges and our justices should be punishable by very serious fines and beyond that. [cheers and applause] But I'd like to ask, because—because we're into that whole system.
And I'd like to call up Daniel. Please come up and tell us about your experience in living in a country that went very, very bad, went radical left, and the experience has not been good. Please come up. Thank you. Hi, Daniel. [cheers and applause]
DANIEL CAMPOS: Thank you. I'm so pleased to meet you.
TRUMP: How are you? Appreciate it. Nice to see you. Please.
CAMPOS: Okay. All right. First of all, hi, everybody. Thank you for coming here and supporting the president. [cheers and applause] I'm going to say the first part of the speech, well, of my story, in English, then I'm going to repeat it in Spanish in order to allow our Latino voters to understand and hear what the situation is going on. [cheers and applause]
First of all, as the president already said, I'm from Venezuela. I left the country in 2007 because of communism. I still have family there. There's been family that has left even before me, or continues leaving little by little. But going farther back, my grandparents from my mom's side were from Cuba.
They were at university when the communist revolution was going on, and they ended up leaving to Venezuela. They only have the money they received for as their wedding present, and they were living in a mid-house, going to school, and trying to move, you know, ahead.
My granddad ended up becoming a doctor, and had a family, raising three children, my mom and my two uncles, when, in the early 1990s, Chavez did a military coup. And right after he run for president, my granddad saw the similarities to what was happening in Cuba, and he told everybody that would listen to him that it was coming. And everybody was like, ""No, this is Venezuela. This is not Cuba. This will never happen to us."" And guess what? It happened to us and has been happening to other Latin American countries as well.
TRUMP: [points down] Right here.
CAMPOS: So when they tell you here, it will never happen, that's not true. We lived it. Now here we are. So, in 2007, we ended up leaving because the socialists and the government, they start changing the education system to make it more like the Cuban education system. It might ring a bell to what's going on here as well. So, it's extremely important for everybody to keep this in mind.
And if you don't mind, I'm going to switch to Spanish for our Latino speakers. [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Yeah, good job.
CAMPOS: Thank you.
Para todos latinomericanos, gracias por venir aquí, soportar Presidente Trump.
Es importante que entendamos que lo que ha pasado en otro países en Latinoamerica puede pasar aquí.
Como mencioné, mi abuela—mi abuelos son de Cuba. Se fueron por el comunismo, llegaron a Venezuela sin ninguna base, solo un poco dinero salieron adelante y se—mi abuelo se convirtió en doctor y crió mi madre y mis dos tios.
Cuando Chavez hizo el atentado—perdón—el golpe de estado y duespués corrió por president. Mi abuelo trató de advertir al todo el mundo que eso es exactamente como Cuba. Nadie le hizo cazo. ¿Que paso? Chavez entró y veinte años duespués, aqui estamos.
Tiene que recordar, que si paso en un lugar, puede pasar aquí también. No crean que porque Estados Unidos, gran economia, no puede pasar. Puede pasar y vamos encaminados al menos que tomemos un paso differente y yo por esto pienso que Trump es la major persona para ser lo.
Going back in English, that we are going on a path that is taking us to what Venezuela became, and the only way right now that we can avoid keep going down that path is making Trump president again. [cheers and applause]
Thank you. It's a pleasure. [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Have you done that before?
CAMPOS: No.
TRUMP: Oh, wow. Thank you, Daniel.
CROWD: USA! USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Great.
CROWD: USA! USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: What a fantastic job. I said, ""Have you done that before?"" He said, ""No, sir."" You are something. [cheers and applause]
All right. What office is he going to run for? I think we're going to endorse him so fast. [cheers and applause]
Thank you very much.
No, it's such a problem because it's a very dangerous situation. She's giving everybody free everything. It's never going to happen. Remember the college debt, the student debt they were going to give? It never happened. It was just all talk. Then he said, after getting totally rejected—he came up with another plan, which is even dumber.
But what happens is they talk. These things will never happen, but it's very dangerous because politically maybe somebody says, ""Oh, that's great. That's great.""
It's the end of our country. We can't do it. We can't do it. So, I really appreciate that. That was beautiful. That was so well done. Amazing. Thank you. [cheers and applause]
In addition to defeating Kamala Harris, you need to defeat your terrible Democrat Senator Bob Casey. [booing] You know I've been there, I've been in Washington for a long time. I mean, I barely met the guy. Most of these guys I get to meet in one form or another, for better or worse. I hardly know this guy. I never really remember meeting him. He obviously created a great impression. But he's not a hard worker. He's cruising on his father's past. I met the father. I think I knew the father better than I knew the son.
But Bob Casey voted for every bill that caused the worst inflation in the history of our country, in my opinion. They call it decades, but I believe it's the history of our country because they're not using the real things.
Like, mortgage rates went from 2% to 10%. They don't say that. That's inflation. They don't say that. And you can't get any money at 10% either. We had it down to two and 2.4, 2.5%, and now you can't get the money at 10%. They don't have any money.
He voted to open borders and the war on Pennsylvania energy. You know, Bob Casey voted against all of this stuff, against your state, but you don't know because you have other jobs. You're not watching Bob Casey. That's why you need to fire Bob Casey, and you have to elect a man named David McCormick for the U.S. Senate.
Dave is strong on borders, great on taxes. He wants to reduce your taxes.
All my life, I've been involved, usually from the other side, it's called writing checks, but I've been involved. I've made lots of contributions to politicians all my life. And politicians always talked about, ""We will lower your taxes."" That's all they talked about is lowering tax. This is the only group I've ever seen where they say, ""We are going to increase your taxes.""
I've never heard of it before.
And by four times. I gave you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, and bigger than the Reagan tax cuts. And they expire in a few months, and they want to not renew them.
If that's the case, you're going to pay four times the tax that you're paying right now. And then they, on top of that, want to increase your taxes to pay for the green new scam. You know what the green new scam is?
CROWD MEMBER: YEAH
TRUMP: The oceans will rise one-eighth of an inch over the next 400 years, but they don't talk about a madman that's building nuclear missiles right now. That's your real global warming. It's not this.
Your global warming is war. Your global warming is going to be nuclear weapons. Nobody talks about that. They don't ever mention it, but they talk about an ocean that's rising, which will give you slightly more beachfront property if it happens.
Now, think of it. But they don't talk about somebody that's got very evil intentions. Look at Iran. I stopped them from building a nuclear weapon, but this guy is going to give it up. [cheers and applause] He's going to give it up.
So, David McCormick. And I've known him for a long time, he's an amazing man, a tremendous education, tremendous military background, and he's a very strong guy, and he loves the state. I really hope you give him a chance.
It's not easy. And I was just talking to him. A guy's been in office for years. He's done nothing. He's done nothing. In that way, it's good, but in another way, it's tough because you've seen his name a little bit. You don't even see his name. Most people don't even know. If you asked, ""Who are the senators?"" they may choose the one that didn't do so well in a debate but won, right? He didn't do too well in a debate. I wonder who did worse in the debate, Biden or him? I think maybe Biden did. I think, actually—
CROWD MEMBER: Fuck Joe Biden!
TRUMP: he's made more sense than a lot of other people over the last few months, in all fairness. He actually has. I commend him on that.
But nobody knows about Casey. Nobody knows about him, even though he's been there for years. His father was there for years. I just want to ask. It's very important because we want to turn our country around.
We need to get great representation even beyond the presidency. And this is a dead seat. It's a seat that voted with this group of people, Barack Hussein Obama, and Biden, and her, because she was a part of it. She's now trying to claim that she has nothing to do with Biden. She had nothing to do with the administration. They put him on. Now, maybe they change it, because I said this a couple of days ago.
Usually, when I say something, they immediately change it so I can't say it anymore, but they gave him speaking on Monday night. Now, have they changed it? I don't think so. Monday night is considered, on a convention, Death Valley. It's Death Valley, because people aren't watching Monday night.
So, they deposed a president. It was a coup of a president. This was a coup.
Nancy Pelosi, Crazy Nancy, she's crazy as a bed bug, Crazy Nancy went in and laid it out. And she never thought he was good, because she's smart, cunning, nasty, mean, but she's crazy. And she went in and she said, ""You're getting out."" And he said, ""No, I'm not. Only God will get me out."" Right? Isn't that what he said? ""Only God."" And within about 24 hours, he announced that he was going to get out. And he won it. He went through a primary system. She didn't. He beat her in the primary. She ran along with 22 people. She ran. She was the first one out because she was no good. She was no good.
And now she's running. And this is not what our country's all about.
And he feels terrible, and he's a very angry man. I watched him yesterday. He's a very angry man. I think he hates them more than he hates Donald Trump, and that's hard to believe. I really do. He's an angry man, and he should be an angry man. They walked in and they stole the presidency of the United States from him. Now, I think he was a terrible president. I think he was the worst president in the history of our country.
I think that Jimmy Carter is the happiest man on Earth today. He's not a young man. Because Jimmy Carter's presidency was brilliant, brilliant by comparison to this. But she was a big part of it, and she's going to be an even bigger part.
Now she wants to give her a whole country away. And just as Daniel and others have said, I mean, its, its—our country's going to die, and yet it's scary because she's given so much away. I mean, who's not going to vote to get some money for House? It's never going to happen. It's trillions of dollars. It's never going to happen. But who's going to vote? I mean, people will maybe vote for this. I said before, it may be good politics, but it's going to destroy our country.
The Washington Post, one of the most evil print journalism, I mean, they've lost a lot of people over the last couple of years, it's nasty, they came out with an editorial excoriating her.
Actually, I spoke with Jeff Bezos just for almost the first time. I met him once before. And he was so complimentary on the way we handled the horrible situation that took place recently, and I appreciated that. But we talked a little bit about the paper. And their radical left paper, they excoriated her in today's editorial. Excoriated her. And I give The Washington Post tremendous credit.
I believe The New York Times did, or is about to do, the same thing. But when they're going after somebody because they're far, far—it's not even left. Every single country that's done this—it's been done many times because it's so easy to say, ""I'm going to give you this. I'm going to give you that. We're going to put price controls on food.""
How do they do that? We're going to say, ""The beans are going to cost this. Cereal's going to—"" It doesn't work. And what happens is you end up with huge inflation and no product because you can't make it anymore, because they lose money hand over fist. So, it doesn't work.
But it's scary because sometimes people vote for it because it sounds good. It sounds good, but it's really bad. We're going to give you tax cuts. [cheers and applause] We're going to give you additional tax cuts. We made our country wealthy. We made our country better than it had ever been before, and we did it. We did it.
The big difference is we had a man serving for three and a half years with her at his side, and we had us. And prior, we did a great job on COVID, never got the credit. I got great credit for the economy, in all fairness to the fake news.
I got great credit for the economy, great credit for the military. We defeated ISIS. We had no new wars. We rebuilt our military. Think of that.
We came up with a new and very important organization, to put it mildly, first time since the Air Force, almost 80 years, Space Force, and we took space, where we were languishing to China, falling way behind China and Russia, we took space, and now we're dominating them. We put some incredible people in there. Space Force has been so important. It'll end up being one of our truly important—already is, I mean, it's coordinating with—but we created Space Force.
We did so many things. Right to Try medically. Right to Try. If you're terminally ill, you had no right to get medicine. Now you sign a document.
They tried to get that for 58 years. 58 years they were unable to get it. I sat everybody down: the labs, the doctors, the insurance companies, and the country, because they didn't want to be sued. Somebody's terminally ill, they take something, they die, and then the family sues them for killing the mother, the father, the sister, the brother. And I said, ""No, you're going to sign a document, and you're not going to sue anybody, but you're going to go home, and you're going to have the greatest drugs in the world that won't be approved for another four or five years."" They're terminally ill. And we have saved thousands and thousands of lives. Thousands. [cheers and applause]
So we did a lot, and we have a lot of other things planned.
Oh, by the way, all of that great work done, we had the greatest lab technicians, the greatest doctors, the greatest laboratories in the world, all of that, under her system, gets wiped out. They're close to a lot of great cures. I worked very hard on that. I also worked very hard on the FDA, getting them to bring it down, bring it down because it was going to take an average of 12 years to get something approved. I got it down to five. I wanted to get it down to two, but things have to happen. But we got it way, way down, and we came up with things.
And we have thousands of people that are living today that were considered terminally ill just a short while ago. It's one of the things I'm most proud—it's called Right to Try. And hopefully, nobody in this room needs it, but if you do, you don't have to go to Asia. You don't have to go to Europe.
Or if you have no money, you go home and you die. That's what happens. Mostly, people don't have any hope. They go home and die. Now you have Right to Try, and thousands of people are living right now that would not be living.
We're also pleased to be joined by a very special man, a friend of mine who's been a warrior from day one, Dan Muser, Congressman Dan Meuser. Thank you, Dan. Great job. Mrs. Meuser, thank you. What a great job. Thank you. Thank you both for being here. No, I'm telling you, he's been fantastic.
A man who would defend me a lot on fake news, CNN. A former senator from your state, your Commonwealth, who was, frankly, a very talented man. He was very good on television. He spent most of his time defending me. Rick Santorum, former senator. Rick, thank you very much. I appreciate the defense. Thank you. [cheers and applause]
Former Congressman Fred Keller. Fred. Thank you very much, doing. The next congressman from Pennsylvania's 8th Congressional District, Rob Bresnahan. Fred. You look good. You look good. He looks good. Pennsylvania Treasurer Stacy Garrity. Thank you, Stacy. Great job you're Thank you, Rob. [cheers and applause] Good. Great primary win. I endorsed him. He went through. Great job. That was a big win. Candidate for the 7th Congressional District, Ryan Mackenzie. [cheers and applause Ryan, thank you. Congratulations.
A man who we picked because, unlike a lot of states, including this one, we were leading by a lot, and then, all of a sudden, a miracle happened. We had another miracle happen about four weeks ago too, but this was a big miracle, and they found millions of votes. They found a lot of votes. But they didn't do that in North Carolina where he was the head of the Republican Party. And I said, ""Who is that guy?""
His name is Michael Whatley, and we appointed him the head of the RNC, the Republican National Committee, and he is doing a fantastic job. [cheers and applause Really, really a great job. Thank you very much.
He's going to keep their cheating down to a minimum, right? Maybe nothing, but we know them better. They won't stop. They won't stop. We have an expression, ""Too big to rig,"" right? ""Too big to rig."" [cheers and applause] And we're leading by a lot, even though we now have to run against some—think of it. I spent 100 million.
Now I have to run against somebody else. Is that fair? I think they should reimburse me for the 100 million. Who wants to collect? Does anybody want to go and collect? I'll get Front Row Joe to collect.
The mayor, who's really a wonderful man, by the way. Mr. Mayor, it was good meeting you. Carl Curran. Thank you. Carl. Thank you very much. Thank you, Carl. [cheers and applause] Good man. New York's Broome County DA, Paul Battisti. Paul Battisti. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Paul. Thank you. Good job you're doing. I wish you were in Manhattan. We could use a good one in Manhattan. And Lackawanna County Commissioner Chris Chermak. [cheers and applause] Chris. Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Chris. Good job. [cheers and applause]
On my first day back in the Oval Office, I will immediately sign an executive order directing every cabinet secretary and agency head to use every power we have to drive prices down. But we're going to drive them down in a capitalist way, not in a communist way.
At the center of this effort will be to end Kamala's war on American energy, and we will drill, baby, drill. [cheers and applause] We're going to get your energy prices down. We're going to get your energy prices down by 50%. The Kamala presidency will mean death for Pennsylvania energy. Remember that. It'll mean death for Pennsylvania energy.
Kamala imposed a natural gas export ban to cripple Pennsylvania energy producers. You do know that she's against this whole energy thing that you have going, which is by far the most important thing you have from an economic standpoint, a job standpoint. She's against it. Kamala supports a carbon tax on the working class, and she's vowed that she will ban fracking, which means 423, 000 plus at least 150,000 jobs beyond that. Pennsylvania is going to always be fracking because we desperately need the energy, and we desperately need the jobs. [cheers and applause] But she will end it. She will end it.
In addition, your state and local government will be starved of billions of dollars in oil and gas revenue, which means higher taxes, lower property values, worse schools, and plunging quality of life in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that I love. I've spent a lot of time here.
I told you I went to school here, the Wharton School of Finance at Penn. [cheers and applause] Under my leadership, we will make America energy independent and energy dominant, and Pennsylvania energy workers will lead the way. You're going to lead the way. It's big stuff.
To further combat inflation, I will terminate Kamala Harris's green new scam, it's the greatest scam maybe ever played, and rescind all of the unspent funds. We're going to take those unspent funds and use them for roads and bridges, and we're going to give back a lot of money into the Treasury and pay down debt. [cheers and applause]
To make both new and used cars more affordable, I will end the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate on day one, one of the most ridiculous things. [cheers and applause] One of the most ridiculous things.
Kamala now claims to want to cut red tape, but in less than four years, she's buried American families in regulations costing a typical household much more than $5,000 per year. Think of that. Just with their red tape.
I will cancel Kamala's crushing regulatory onslaught, and I will immediately eliminate every costly job. Now, just so you know, I cut regulations more than any president in history by far. [cheers and applause By far. So you can't say to me, ""Well, why didn't you do it?"" With me, you can't say that on anything. I did do it, everything I said. They said, ""Promises made, promises kept."" What I said, I kept, I mean, unless there was some crazy thing somewhere. But I got it done. I got it all done.
Even the wall. I built hundreds of miles of wall. [cheers and applause] And I had to fight Congress. I had to fight the Senate like you wouldn't believe. I built hundreds of miles of wall. And I ended up taking it out and winning in court. We had 11 lawsuits by mostly Democrats like Nancy Pelosi. We had 11 different—we won every one of them.
But think of it, I built the wall. I said, ""I'm taking it out of the military because our country's being invaded. This is an invasion of our country."" And we built hundreds of miles of wall. Then we built and had made an extra 200 miles that we were going to use to expand it further than I ever said, and it was made and ready to be installed, and we had a rigged election. And what happened after that was they didn't want to do it, and they sold it for 5 cents on the dollar. [booing] 5 cents. Very sophisticated stuff, too.
To get economic relief to workers and families, I will make the Trump tax cuts permanent, and we will have no tax on tips, which she copied. [cheers and applause] She copied.
You all know by now, she came out a few days ago, and she said, ""There will be no tax on—"" I said, ""I said that months ago."" But here's one that she hasn't copied yet, to help seniors on fixed incomes who are suffering the ravages of horrible inflation caused by Crooked Joe and Kamala, there will be no tax on Social Security, so get out— And I get it done. [cheers and applause] I will get it done. They won't. They haven't even promised it to you, but they won't get it done if they do.
And I will always protect Social Security and Medicare for our great seniors, just as I did for four incredible years.
By contrast, Kamala Harris has a three-step plan to destroy Medicare and Social Security. She's going to destroy your Medicare. She's going to destroy your Social Security.
First, she has thrown open our borders.
Second, she is flooding our country with millions and millions of low-wage migrants and giving them welfare: free healthcare, food stamps, public benefits. [booing]
And third, she wants to make them all citizens of the United States. [booing] Many of them coming from prison, many of them coming from mental institutions, and many are terrorists. She wants to make them citizens, dumping them onto Medicare, and dumping them into your beautiful Social Security program.
Remember, for four years, I saved Social Security. I never gave an increase. I never raised the age by five years, which is what they're going to end up doing. With me, it's staying the way it is. We have a lot of ways we're making money. We don't need to take it away from our seniors.
The millions of illegal aliens pouring in under border czar—she was the border czar, right? She was the border czar. Now, about a month ago, she said, ""I wasn't—wasn't the border czar. She was the border czar. But it doesn't matter. She was in charge of the border a hundred percent.
But border czar Harris are coming in from the worst places, some of the most dangerous countries in the world. And as I said, they're emptying out their jails and prisons and they're emptying out their mental institutions and they're dumping them into our country.
What's happening to our country is shocking. It's unacceptable. And we have no choice. We're going to do the largest deportation in the history of our country. [cheers and applause]
We have no choice. [cheers and applause]
Just this week in Coney Island II, Kamala migrants were arrested for the rape of a 46-year-old woman, throwing her to the ground and raping her with a knife to her throat. [booing] She thought they were going to kill her. She said, ""They weren't looking to rape me. They were looking to kill me."" And it was a terrible thing.
One of them had previously been arrested for raping another woman at a migrant shelter, but he was shielded from deportation by New York City sanctuary laws, which Kamala Harris strongly supported and doesn't want to change. [booing]
In Virginia, three weeks ago, a 54-year-old mother of four was leaving a 7/11 when she noticed an illegal alien trying to steal her car. When she tried to stop him, he ran her down and left her dead on the ground before going on to hit two more cars, killing two other drivers.
And in May, the leader of a Peruvian gang known as Los Killers, was released from border patrol custody, and set free into America and Kamala's direct orders, she said, ""Set him free.""
Meanwhile, he was wanted for 23 murders in Peru. Kamala refuses even to call these criminals, and we not going to use the term, she said, illegal aliens. No, they are illegal aliens, but she said, ""Don't ever use that term."" But they're not just illegal aliens, honestly, they're monsters. These are savage monsters. [cheers and applause]
The Harris policy is to let thousands of migrant killers and rapists into our country. She was asked the other day, but she didn't respond. We have detention centers where we have some of the worst criminals in the world in those detention centers from other countries and not just South America. They come from Africa, they come from Asia, they come from the Middle East.
They come from countries that are seriously crime ridden. And those countries, the crimes are going way down like Venezuela.
We talked about Venezuela or before, and think about Venezuela. Their crime is down 72%. They've gone to Caracas and they've gone to different places in Venezuela. They've taken their murderers, their drug dealers, their rapists, their thugs and they've taken them out of the country. They've said, ""You're going to the United States of America and if you come back, we will kill you."" And they are now living with us. All will be criminals soon.
And don't forget, they're just getting used to the experience of being in a country where criminals are treated better, far better than the people that are being hurt and victimized. [booing] And when they see that and they're going to have levels of crime, I call it migrant crime, we'll call it Kamala migrant crime.
She destroyed San Francisco.
She destroyed Los Angeles.
I call it migrant crime.
She had something that she went with. You're not a criminal. It's a very minor offense if you steal anything from a store that's less than $950, did you know that? So guys are walking into stores with—they walk into stores with a calculator, keep it under 950 and nothing's going to happen. By the way, if it goes to 9,050, nothing happens either. What's happened in California with Governor Newsom and guys like this, people like this is terrible.
But Kamala, but Kamala, what environment, what a beautiful place, what a great place. The weather is so beautiful, the ocean, everything's beautiful. Its crime ridden and horrible and changes have to be made.
The Trump policy is to keep these savage criminals the hell out of our country. [cheers and applause They're going to be out of our country. If Kamala wins, you'll have mass amnesty and citizenship for all. She wants to give all of these people citizenship.
In Venezuela, their crime is down 72%. In other countries all over the world, their crime is way down. And in our country, wait till you see the real numbers because they're not counting migrant crime, which is going to make our crime look like baby stuff.
If I win, you will have the largest operation of police to take care of us. They have to take care of us. They want to take care of us. They want to do their job. [cheers and applause] As border patrol wants to do their job and it's going to start on inauguration day, January 20th, 2025. It's going to start immediately. [cheers and applause]
They want to do their job and we don't let them. And if they do their job and if they're a little bit strong about doing their job, they're dealing with a lot of very tough people. They take away their pension, they take away their job, they lose their family, they lose their house, they lose everything. They end up in squalor. And we're not going to do that.
We're going to defend our great local police and law enforcement. In general, we're going to defend them. [cheers and applause] We're going to defend them.
We want them to protect us and we're going to need them much more than ever before because the criminals pouring into our country by the millions. I believe the real number is over 20 million people. You don't hear that. 10 million, 12 million, even if it was, it's still so many. But the real number is over 20 million people. That's larger than New York state.
Kamala Harris wants to eliminate private health insurance and give free taxpayer funded healthcare to every single illegal alien in the country. [booing] And then you wonder why do they come up? You know why they come up? Because guys like Newsom and others are saying, ""Come up, come to our country. We'll give you healthcare."" You know what they're doing to your school system is incredible. People are taking the seats of your children. Your children can't go to school.
And you have people taking their seats that don't speak a word of English, come from a foreign country and your kids aren't getting educated. Your kids are not getting educated. They're considered like secondary citizens. And this is Kamala and Joe to a lesser extent.
Look, Joe, Joe's lost. He's—forget him.
By contrast, I'm going to keep the Affordable Care Act unless we can do something much better. We'll keep it, but we can do much better. It's too expensive for the people. They can't afford it. It's lousy healthcare. If we can do something better, we're working on it. If we can do something better, but we will never let anybody touch it unless we have something better.
We're going to deliver lower prices, lower drug costs, and new options that will dramatically reduce the crushing burden on all American patients.
And Kamala and Crooked Joe, they try and take credit for $35 insulin, but I was the one that did the $35 insulin, not them. [cheers and applause]
Just kicked in during their administration. I remember a couple of years, a few years ago, I said, ""Boy, oh boy."" They said, ""Sir, this will kick in over the next two and a half, three years."" I said, ""What about now?"" You couldn't do it, just to process. I said, ""I hope I win the presidency because I want to get credit for that."" But he gets up there, ""Oh, we got $35."" I got it.
Kamala Harris,' Democrat Party is the party of healthcare for illegals. The Republican Party is the party of common sense. We really are the party of common sense ultimately. [cheers and applause]
So we will bring back our supply chain, the supply chains, and they've been so devastated. Our supply chains are— You order something and they say, ""Sir, that'll be four months."" And then four months comes up and they say it's going to be another four months. It's stuck at sea. They have no idea where the hell it is.
But we're going to bring them back from China and other foreign countries ending costly supply chain disruptions. And they are really bad. There is bad now as they were—but we get used to it. We're living like a third-world country. Who thought?
As we reduce burdens on domestic manufacturers, American workers will make our critical goods better and cheaper right here in the USA and right here in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause]
And I will, with David, revoke China's most favored nation's trade status. You know, hey have a huge advantage. Because they are a growing nation. Well, we're a growing nation too. We're a nation that is crippled. We are a horribly crippled nation. And China gets all of these advantages in trade because they consider themselves to be a growing nation. Well, we're a growing nation too. And I did that already.
I will pass what will be known as the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act. If China or any other country makes us pay 100 or 200% tariff, we will make them pay a reciprocal tariff of 100 or 200% right back.
You hurt us, we hurt you. It's called an eye for an eye.
I will also restore peace through strength and I will prevent World War III from happening. We will stop it. [cheers and applause]
When crooked, Hillary Clinton was running against me. She said, ""Look at him. Listen to him. He will start a war, a world war.""
We had no wars other than I defeated ISIS in its entirety, 100% of the ISIS caliber.
""Listen to his rhetoric. Listen to his horrible tone."" I said that horrible tone is going to keep people from fighting us, and that's what happened.
We had no wars.
It's been 81 years since that happened for a president.
No wars other than ending some wars that we are in and defeating ISIS. Two days ago, I watched a parade of the Taliban in Afghanistan. Did you see it? The Taliban were—they were showing all of our equipment that they took from America, $85 billion worth, two days ago, celebrating three years of the defeat of America by these guys.
And I knew them very well. Abdul was the head. Abdul was not playing games with me. They were executing a lot of our soldiers. And I spoke to him. I said, ""Abdul, don't do it anymore. There'll be no more.""
Anyway, I said it pretty tough. And you know what? For 18 months we didn't have one American soldier killed in Afghanistan. [cheers and applause]
And then I left. And then I left.
And this bunch of incompetent people took over and it all started up again. And then they had the most embarrassing day in the history of our country, I thought. But she bragged about being the last person in the room that night, the night that they decided to do whatever they decided to do. In other words, she had the final vote and she bragged about it. It's been the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan. It should have never, ever happened. We should have gotten out with dignity and strength.
And you don't take your military out first. You take your military out last. They couldn't believe we did it.
Under Trump, we will have no more wars, no more disruptions, and we will have prosperity and peace for all. And again, we're going to bring back that American dream for all of the young people in this audience and some of the old ones.
This is how we will end the era of inflation, mayhem and misery under Kamala and crooked Joe Biden and unleash safety, prosperity, and promise for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. Every single one of them are going to understand peace and wealth. And we're going to be a dominant force again. We're going to be respected as a country again. Right now, we're being laughed at that. [cheers and applause]
Together we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates, low inflation.
We had almost no inflation during my four years, almost nothing. And they went up to nine and a half percent. And that number's a fake number because they don't add the worst categories. It was much higher than that. But it was record setting inflation that everyone can—we're going to make sure—afford your groceries, afford a car, afford a home, low interest rates.
We're going to get it all down. We will stop the invasion. We will end migrant crime. We'll support our great police. We will strengthen our military, build a missile defense shield over the top of our country, an iron dome. It'll be a great iron dome and much of it will be made right here in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause]
Why shouldn't we have that? Why shouldn't we have that? Other countries can have it, but we can't. It was our idea.
Ronald Reagan wanted it many years ago. But then in all fairness, you didn't have the technology. Today, you do. We're going to have an iron dome to protect us from the lunatics out there.
And we're going to keep critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools and we are going to keep men out of women's sports.
No men in women's sports.
Did you see in the Olympics? They had two transitioned. They transitioned. Uh they were men. They transitioned to women and they were in the boxing.
And a young Italian woman was boxing one of the transitioned men. And she got hit with a jab. [mimes punching] Just boom. A jab is not like the hard—this is the harder one, right? If you're right-handed. Boom. And she backed up. She said, ""What just hit me. I just got hit with a horse. What just hit me?"" Think of that. Then he did it again. Boom. And she said, ""Okay, that's enough."" Two jabs. Then the other one—and by the way, he went on to easily win the gold medal. He just walked through everybody. [booing] He won the gold medal.
Then there was another one, a transitioned man, and he also won the gold medal. He transitioned and he won the gold medal very easily. So the two fighters won the gold medals very easily. And she came out, the Italian girl, beautiful girl, very good boxer. And she said, ""Nobody's ever hit me like that."" Two jabs. She said, ""I've never been hit."" She just said, ""That's enough. That's enough.""
It's crazy. It's so demeaning to women. How about the weightlifting? Hundreds of pounds more hundreds. Records that haven't been broken in 18 years. One eighth of an ounce here, one eighth of an ounce. And they can't do it. You could do it. They can't do it. And a guy comes out, excuse me, a transitioned person. How much more is that? Oh, that's 128 pounds more. How crazy is this? Our country has gone crazy and we're going to put it back on track. We are the party of common sense. [cheers and applause]
We will defend the Second Amendment, restore free speech, and we will secure our elections.
Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive.
We're going to be a thriving country again.
And every day we'll be filled with joy, opportunity, and hope. Right now, it's filled with sorrow. It's sorrow.
People are so embarrassed by what's happening to our country. They're waiting for Iran to drop weapons all over Israel. But it hasn't happened. You know why? Because our country is willing to pay them billions and billions of dollars. How about where they negotiate? I had 58 people; we negotiated and we didn't pay. 58 hostages I got out. 59 I think, and got them out even from North Korea, the toughest.
Had a good relationship with Kim Jong-Un. But I got them out. But you never pay because once you pay, you got to pay. How about we pay $6 billion, 6 billion and we get some out.
And in the case of Russia, they get the Prince of Doom. You know who the Prince of—the greatest arms dealer, they say in the history of the world and they got him. And we also gave $6 billion. It's so embarrassing. And the world is watching. And when you pay $6 billion, all of a sudden people are going to be disappearing from the streets all over the place. And it's a very bad precedent is being set in many ways, including the weaponization of our government.
I could have done that with Hillary Clinton. And I said to myself, ""How would it look? We're trying to unify the country. How would it look if I had arrested and put in prison the wife of the President of the United States?"" I thought it was not good. And then they do that to me. They want to put me away. But you know what? I get indicted for you. To me, I'm just here. I'm just standing in their way. [cheers and applause]
I said to them, ""Fellas, you know—"" I was no fan of Hillary, but I said, ""How would it look if we put her in prison? We're going to put Hillary Clinton, the wife and a Secretary of State. We're going to put her in prison?"" But we never did this stuff. And then I came along. It's double standard. They do. They want to do it to me. So far, they've been very unsuccessful. But they would like to.
We must defeat Kamala Harris and we must stop her country destroying liberal agenda, liberal like nobody's ever seen in the history of our country. So get your friends, get your family register, volunteer. Get out and vote and vote for that guy right there, David. [cheers and applause]
The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020 and we not going to allow them to rig the presidential election in 2024. [cheers and applause]
And we want a landslide.
Not going to let it happen.
We're not going to have a country left. You need two things to start. You need a strong, beautiful, fair border and you need fair and free elections. And we have neither, right? [cheers and applause]We have neither.
On November 5th, we will save our economy. We will rescue our middle class. We will reclaim our sovereignty and restore our borders. We will put America first and we will fight, fight, fight. We're going to fight. We're going to fight for our country. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.
But this is a very consequential commonwealth as we say. But this is a very consequential vote in Pennsylvania because they say that if you win Pennsylvania, you're going to win the whole thing. [cheers and applause]
We cannot let these people win Pennsylvania. That includes David. Can't let it happen.
And together we will make America powerful again. [cheers and applause]
We're going to make it powerful, powerful.
We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. [cheers and applause] We will make America safe again.
We will make America free again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause]

TRUMP: Thank you very much. [cheers and applause] That's beautiful. This is quite a place. It's an honor to be here at Precision Custom Components, a company that has helped to build and defend America for over 150 years. That's really an extraordinary achievement.
I want to thank you, President Gary Butler and the members of the wonderful Butler family, members of Congress, Scott Barry, and GT Thompson. You're here someplace in this very big factory, wherever you may be. There you are. Great people, great warriors I will tell you.
My trade representative ambassador, Robert Lighthizer, who's fantastic at a thing called trade. We did very well at trade and you were fantastic. And I want to thank you, Bob, very much. And chair of the York County Commissioners, Julie Wheeler. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Julie, very much. Thank you. And a very special congratulations to all of the people of York County today who are celebrating the 275th anniversary of York County's founding. That's pretty good. [cheers and applause] That beats most of them out there.
But most of all, let me thank the exceptionally skilled and talented workers with us in this room. I know you well. I know them from all over the country they come and they are the most talented people and the most brilliant people in so many respects. So thank you all very much for being here. We appreciate it. Thank you. [cheers and applause]
For generations, the handwork of Precision Custom Components has strengthened the spine of America. Your products have gone into the Hoover Dam and atomic energy plants, nuclear submarines, and they currently are doing a lot of work.
I'm here today to deliver a simple message. When I'm back in the White House, America's future will be built right here in Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] And it will be built by American workers like you. Be all over the country will be building, but Pennsylvania is always a big factor. And we've had great success, as you know, politically and otherwise in Pennsylvania. And we expect to have it again. We're doing very well here. Thank you very much.
With your vote, we will unleash explosive economic growth and vast due prosperity for all of our citizens. We will put more money into your pockets and create millions and millions of new jobs. Gonna do it like nobody else has ever been able to do it. Our plan will massively cut taxes, unlock American energy slash regulations, big factor, crack down on trade cheaters and stop outsourcing, rebuild our industrial base and bring back those beautiful words ""Made in the USA."" [cheers and applause]
And we were doing that four years ago and starting to do really well. And then we had to stop for an unknown reason. Together we will reclaim our nation's destiny as the number one manufacturing superpower in the world. We will do it and China won't even be close. Nobody will be. We had that going at a level that nobody's seen before and we're going to have it going again even better. And this firm and this people standing behind me and in front of me will be a big factor.
Every policy in Kamala Harris's radical Liberal playbook sends jobs and wealth to other countries. [booing] The jobs go to other countries and the wealth goes to other countries. Every policy in the Trump agenda is designed to bring the jobs and wealth back home to America where it belongs and where it's going to stay. Kamala puts America last. I put America first. [cheers and applause]
Some facts that are interesting. The year before I took office, the United States lost over 10,000 manufacturing jobs. Everybody said you'd never bring it back. But under my leadership, we created more than a half a million manufacturing jobs in less than three years. After decades of wage stagnation and income surged, we had a surge like nobody's ever seen before, but it surged for everybody during the Trump administration, every group, everybody, men, women. We had every household was at a level that they've never really experienced before. The typical American household saw their incomes grow by more than $4,200 per year. Everyone was better off when you had a gentleman named President Donald J. Trump at the helm. Does anybody know him,—[cheers and applause] whoever he may be? I kept every single promise I made to the workers of Pennsylvania and to every other place within our country.
On day one, I withdrew from the unfair job killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. And if I didn't do that, you wouldn't be open right now. You wouldn't have a job. That was a big thing. It was approved by another president who would've destroyed our manufacturing in this country still further.
I imposed historic tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel and numerous other things that were unfair to our country and unfair to our workers. I ended the total disaster known as NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made by this country, and replaced it with the brand new USMCA. That's Mexico and Canada, the best trade deal ever made by our country, although I will tell you that I think the deal with China was probably even better. They had to buy $50 billion worth of our product, but after Covid, I don't even talk about that anymore, $50 billion they had to buy, and they were buying it too.
I stood up to China like never before, bringing in hundreds of billions of dollars when no other president had gotten literally 10 cents from China, brought in hundreds of billions of dollars from China, never happened before. Nobody else literally got 10 cents.
We passed the largest tax cuts in history, the largest regulation cuts in history, and built the greatest economy of the history of the world. We were at a level that nobody had ever seen before, and now we're going to do it again, but we're going to do it even bigger, better, stronger, and smarter.
When I left office, I handed Kamala and crooked Joe Biden a surging economy with no inflation. You had no inflation. You had—Everything was good, great wages, no inflation. Now, you have inflation at levels that I don't believe anyone's ever seen before.
The 30-year mortgage rate was 2.6%, but it was actually closer to 1.9 if you look at it the way that most people look at it. And gasoline had reached and was basically at levels of $1.87 a gallon, but we had months and moments where it was even less than that. Wouldn't that be nice, $1.87, Gary? [steps away from podium] That would be very nice. The family likes it more than Gary. Gary's been around too long. The family likes it more.
Our economic future, it never looked brighter. When Kamala and Biden came in, they quickly blew it all up. Destroyed. 350,000 Americans joined the unemployment rolls last month. Did you know that? I keep hearing about their economy. Their economy's terrible, and the inflation is eating everybody alive, and it's been doing that for three years.
The no inflation or almost no inflation, it kept going during the early part of this administration, this current administration, but it ended very quickly, and then it went to levels, and so quickly, it went so fast, and it was a shame. It was all blown up and destroyed, and jobs were lost. A lot of jobs were lost. Our country is doing really badly under them, and nobody wants to talk about it. The media doesn't like talking about it, because the Democrats, they really protect themselves. It's pretty amazing. Someday, the media is going to become real media instead of fake media, and you're going to see a big difference in the country. [cheers and applause]
Real incomes are down $2,000 a year since she took office. Kamala casts the tie-breaking votes that gave us the worst inflation in American history costing a typical family $28,000. Under Kamala, we have fallen into manufacturing recession with 13,000 manufacturing jobs lost in the United States since just the start of this year.
I don't know if you all know that, but that's what's happened. And it'll happen here, and it'll happen in this plant. It'll happen everywhere. If she gets in, if Kamala gets in, the United States will rapidly become a de-industrialized third-world nation like so many others have become.
She's running on socialist price controls, banning gas-powered cars and trucks, and private health insurance policies are gone. She wants to defund the police, abolish cash bail. She wants to abolish it immediately, cash bail. She wants to abolish ICE, get rid of the incredible brave patriots of ICE who take MS-13 gang members, probably the worst gang anywhere in the world, horrible situation. They take them out, and they take them out bravely. They're strong. They're fierce, and they love our country. She wants to give free healthcare for millions of illegal aliens, and give them all citizenship into the United States immediately.
She then wants to sign them up for Medicare and Social Security, and she wants them to vote illegally if possible, any way they can vote. They don't care if it's illegal or not, [booing] and they're signing people up as we speak. They're signing them up as we speak. They don't care. They don't care about the laws. Very simply, Kamala Harris is an economy wrecker and a country destroyer. Our country will be destroyed if she gets in. Her radical liberal agenda ruined San Francisco. It ruined California when she was the Attorney General. It crushed our middle class, demolished our border, set the world on fire, and now she wants to be promoted to the job killer in chief, but much more than job killer.
Everything else is going to go bad. She set the standard in California. Think of this. If you steal $950 or less, they're going to leave you alone. They can't be bothered. So, you see criminals going into stores with a little computer adding it up, everything they've stolen. They want to stay under the 950, but they don't get prosecuted for above that. The only one that gets prosecuted is somebody who would talk about the unfair election. They get prosecuted.
But when you steal and rob and kill and so many other things, when you sell drugs and destroy people's lives, nothing happens to you under Kamala, but we will not let this happen. We're not going to let it happen to our country. 78 days from now, Pennsylvania is going to tell her that we've had enough, that we can't take it anymore. Comrade,—[cheers and applause] comrade, Kamala, Harris, you are fired. Get out. You're not doing the job. Get out. [cheers and applause] You are fired.
While Biden and Harris have been impoverishing our country, they have been getting rich, very rich at your expense. Now, it just came out, just was reported today by a great young reporter, Brooke Singman at Fox. According to a 292-page report from the House Oversight Judiciary on Ways and Means Committees in Congress, just got out a little while ago just before I got here.
I said, ""No, I want to talk about it just briefly."" It's so sad, because he's going to be making his speech tonight, and they don't call him crooked Joe for no reason. They said, ""President Biden engaged in impeachable conduct, and said he abused his office and defrauded the United States of America to enrich his family.""
Republicans revealed that since 2014, the Biden family and its associates received more than $27 million from foreign individuals and entities. They also found that while Biden was serving as vice president, the Biden family got more than $8 million in loans from Democrat benefactors, and they said that those loans have never been repaid. Those are the best kind of loans, aren't they?
This report says in part that Vice President Biden actively participated in this conspiracy by, among other things, attending dinners with his family, foreign business, partners, and speaking to them by phone, often being placed on speakerphone by Hunter Biden. Republicans are calling out a 2014 dinner that Hunter Biden and his family attended with a Russian oligarch. They said that after that dinner, that oligarch wired $3.5 million to Hunter Biden's firm very quickly. It was a very quick wiring. I'm sure he worked very hard for the money. Several witnesses testified that Hunter Biden invoked his father in business dealings with Romanian, Chinese, Kazakhstani, and Ukrainian companies in addition to other companies and people, resulting in millions and millions of dollars flowing into the Biden family.
As everybody knows, $3.5 million was sent from the mayor of Moscow, the mayor of Moscow's wife. Remember, I brought that up in the debate I had. I said, ""Why did this happen?"" And the anchor wouldn't let me ask that question. They thought it was inappropriate, but then it blew up. $ 3.5 million dollars was sent by the mayor of Moscow's wife to the family. They were also calling out Biden for his handling of classified documents. They said during his tenure as vice president, Joe Biden removed highly sensitive classified documents from the White House, despite having no authority to do so.
And remember, comrade Kamala, she knew everything, and the senators knew what was going on. By the way, I had my own classified documents case,—and I was totally exonerated, totally. [cheers and applause]
It was a case brought by Joe Biden and Kamala. She was involved. They did that in order to interfere with the election, and it still goes on different cases, but that was according to most the big one, and we were totally exonerated. The case was won a month ago. Very little coverage of the case being won, I must say. I think that a lot of the media didn't even talk about it.
There's no way someone could have stolen that much money without Democrat senators knowing what was going on. He wined and dined them at Joe's houses. They saw his boats. They saw the way he lived. They saw his beautiful mansions.
I would've made billions of dollars in this job if I wanted to play that game the way they played it, but instead, I took the job very seriously and very importantly. And you can see from the recently announced financial reports, I don't need the money, and I'm proud to announce that doing and being president, I lost billions of dollars, and I knew that would happen. Maybe not quite as much as that, but I'm satisfied with that, because we want to make America great again. That's much more important. We have to make America great again. [cheers and applause]
Though, I could have played it the other way. I could have made so much. I see some of my friends over here. I could have made so much.
No, I didn't want to do that. This is too important. This is too big a thing. We got to save our country, because our country is really in big trouble. We're a nation in decline.
We're going down the drain. The drain is the swamp that you've heard so much about. They get rich, and in Washington, some of these politicians, what they're doing to our country is disgraceful, but he's one of the leaders of the pack. You have others.
The number one step we will take to launch a great American manufacturing renaissance will be to end Kamala Harris' war on American energy. It's a war, and you do know that inflation was caused by her cutback on energy. Then what they did is they, in a panic, move shortly thereafter when the numbers for gasoline, oil, and electricity and everything else that comes from energy and out of energy.
When they started going through the roof, they immediately went back to the Trump plan, but what they didn't go back to is my plan would've been doubled, tripled, and even quadrupled from the numbers I had four years ago. They didn't do that. They brought it back to a similar, because they were getting just absolutely destroyed by the numbers. It was going up, and you can bet that if we don't win, she takes over. Your energy numbers will be triple and quadruple, and you won't be producing a drop of oil.
They ended the largest oil reserve anywhere in the world, probably as large as Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Arabia has this massive amount of oil. It's called ANWR in Alaska. They ended it on close to day one. They ended it. Ronald Reagan couldn't get it. No other president got it. I got it, and it's bigger than Russia, bigger than Saudi Arabia most likely.
They seem to think biggest in the world they've been after. They've been after getting that approved for many, many decades. Ronald Reagan worked so hard to get it. He couldn't get it. I got it, and then they ended it.
They were just set to start drilling. Everything was done, and he came into office. He ended it. On day one, I will tell the frackers and energy workers of Pennsylvania to drill, baby, drill, —[cheers and applause] and she's totally a non-fracker. You know that. Until a few months ago, she said, ""Oh."" It's just like on tips. We're not going to tax tips. All of a sudden, she comes out and she says the same thing, exactly the same words that I used months later, and other things she said, like trying to copy my policy, but it takes much more than copying a policy, because they're never going to produce it anyway.
Our country's going to be in serious trouble, but she was a non-fracker, no fracking under any circumstances. She's like 100 times saying, ""I will not frack."" Look at her debates. There will be no fracking. There will be no —
Then a few months ago, she said, ""Oh, we'd love to frack with a politician."" They go back to their original thought. There will be no fracking if she's elected in Pennsylvania or anywhere else. You'll have energy that will go up three, four, five times.
You'll be paying $10 a gallon for gasoline, and a lot higher than that. Unleashing American energy will reduce prices, launch record-setting economic growth, create millions and millions of jobs, and produce higher wages for the American worker.
You can't be a manufacturing powerhouse unless you have low-cost energy. We will have low-cost energy. [cheers]
Electricity rates for a Chinese factory are more than 50% lower than the price of electricity for an American factory, and we were working four years ago at really getting it along, and then we were hit with uh? The Covid came in. We focused on that. We did a great job.
If we didn't do a great job in that, we would've been in a depression like in 1929, which is where you're heading if she gets in. You're heading for the depression of 1929, that type. That's called the big league depression.
Since Kamala took office, electricity prices in America up much more than 30% nationwide, and here in Pennsylvania, they're expected to increase by another 30%. They think it's going to be actually unsustainable for your state if she gets in. It's not sustainable. It's not sustainable for the country. That's why I've declared that a top priority for my administration will be to cut the cost of energy in half within the first 12 months of taking office. [cheers and applause]
So, we'll cut it in half. I think we'll be able to do better than that. We're going to be cutting it in half, guys.
That'll help you a little bit [inaudible].
CROWD MEMBER: Absolutely.
TRUMP: I think we'll do that very quickly. That includes heating, air conditioning, electricity, and gasoline. Your bills will be less than half. When you look at the New England area, they pay some of the highest energy anywhere in the world because they can't put a pipeline in. They've been restricted from putting a pipeline in through a certain section of New York that is desperately wanting it.
They need the job so badly. And if they did that in New England, the prices would come down half just with the pipeline alone. They were getting their gasoline and their energy from a place called Russia. Ships would pull up on the east coast, Russian ships, and that's where New England got it from, and they were paying a big price. And to this day, they're paying the highest prices, but we'll take care of that.
We think energy costs, all of it, air conditioning, heating, all of it, including gasoline, will drop by more than 50% within the first 12 months. [cheers and applause]
So remember that. That includes for factories. [cheers and applause]
This will help us quickly defeat inflation and make America affordable again. By contrast, Kamala Harris wants to ban fracking. She supports a national carbon tax, which is a horrible tax that will destroy many businesses, that will have a huge impact on this business, but that will destroy a carbon tax. Nobody even knows what it is. Nobody knows how to calculate it. And she imposed a natural gas export ban, all catastrophic things for Pennsylvania. [booing]
That means all the income coming in. For the most part, you'll have none of it. You'll lose 500, 000 jobs and you won't have the income coming up. That means Pennsylvania is going to have to pay, your commonwealth, your beautiful commonwealth is going to have to pay numbers that nobody ever thought even possible or worth discussion.
Kamala is also on a regulatory jihad to shut down power plants all across America. Now, Germany tried it just a couple of years ago and they ended up getting rid of their political leaders very quickly, and now they're building probably 50 or 60 power plants currently, and they're looking to build a lot more. But they got rid of everything and they wanted to go to wind and solar and lots of other things. Unfortunately, it didn't work.
They couldn't fire up the plants. The plants were closed and they couldn't get them going, and now they've gone to the other extreme. They've gone back to fossil fuel, I hope clean fossil fuel, clean coal. They do have clean coal. They have coal that actually has to make your electricity. And if you didn't have fossil fuel, you wouldn't have electricity because that's where it comes from originally. And you can have very clean and efficient natural gas.
At least 50 existing power plants have closed since she took office, Kamala took office. They're closing them all over the country. They're closing nuclear. They're closing coal. They're closing everything. We're not going to have —
That's why in California, you have blackouts all the time, constant blackouts, and yet they want to go to all-electric cars. Let's go to all-electric cars, even though we don't have enough electricity to give it ourselves some cool and some heat in the summers and the winters.
I'm announcing today that when I return to the White House, I will end the anti-American energy crusade and terminate Kamala's so-called power plant rule. It's a disaster for our country.
Our country will have no jobs by the time these communists and Marxists get rid of—I mean when they—when they destroy the country, probably can never come back either, just so you understand. Too much competition from other countries that are doing it right. We have a lot of competition out there. Not only China, we have a lot of other competition.
Instead of shutting down power plants, we will open dozens and dozens more, and they'll happen fast. Kamala stands for energy disappearance and factory obliteration. She will obliterate factories like this.
I stand for American energy independence and manufacturing dominance. We're going to be dominant in manufacturing. We're going to be dominant in energy too, not just um getting it to take care of ourselves. We're going to be selling it all over the world. We're going to be reducing our debt. We're going to be lowering your taxes still further.
Don't forget I gave you the largest tax cut in history. We're going to be lowering your taxes still further. Upon taking office, I will do rapid approvals for new energy infrastructure, and we will embrace all forms of energy including nuclear.
Nuclear is a great energy.
This plant is making some things that I just got to see, and it's incredible what you've done, what Gary and the family have done. The level of complexity, the level of detail, the power that we're talking about is incredible to power our country into the future, including the electricity demands of AI and cryptocurrencies, which is a very big subject. It's coming up more and more, and we have to stay at the top. We want to be right at the forefront.
Otherwise China and other countries will take it over. That's both of them, AI and crypto.
We will make a historic commitment to bring in advanced small modular nuclear reactors online, building these massive plants that cost $20 billion and don't even get built like we had recently in a couple of other states. I won't mention the states, but they had two plants that got so out of control with cost overruns, massive, massive nuclear plants. Now we're going to do small reactors, small nuclear, we call it.
France does that. France does very well with that. They do small. And if they need more, they build a second one, a third one, a fourth one. They hook them up together. With the help of companies like yours, these can be built ultra safe. They're ultra clean, and they're very low cost, but they are absolutely safe. Under Kamala's green new scam, billions and billions of taxpayer dollars are being sent to subsidize solar panel factories, windmill factories, battery production and car production all based in China.
We are subsidizing massive amounts of product for solar, for wind. It's all made in China.
Under the Trump administration, we will build American, buy American, and hire American. [cheers and applause]
That's what we're going to be doing. Kamala's economic agenda rewards outsourcers and punishes American workers by making it economically impossible to manufacture in America.
What I'm promising today is a total pro-American overhaul of our tax regulation and trade systems to promote domestic production and punish those who ship jobs and factories overseas or to places like Mexico, where right now, the head of the United Auto workers doesn't know this. They're building some of the biggest car factories, just started, anywhere in the world. The person I know builds car factories. That's all he does, build car factories.
He said the biggest ones in the world are being right now in Mexico. And they think they're going to bring those cars in, make them in Mexico, bring them in here, and sell them to our people and destroy Detroit and the rest of our car business. They've already taken 30% before I got there, 30%.
They did nothing against us when I was there. I told them, ""If you want to build car factories, you're going to have to pay a 100% tariff to get the car into this country."" They immediately said, ""Well, I guess we're not going to build a car factory."" Right? That's what happened, but now they're building the biggest in the world right in Mexico, and they think they're going to take our car.
They're not going to do that if I'm here because I will be putting massive tariffs on those cars coming across the border, and it won't make any economic sense. So I actually think they should stop building them unless they want to sell those cars to another country.
Kamala wants no taxes on Chinese producers, wants no taxes. What's that all about? While imposing the largest tax hike in the history of our country on factories in the United States.
Okay, so she wants a no tax policy on China, but she wants to tax factories like this and other factories at levels that they've never seen before. Under her plan, manufacturers will pay even higher taxes in America than in Communist China. By contrast, I will pass gigantic tax cuts for workers and keep their jobs here in the United States. They're going to stay here. [cheers and applause]
We're going to beat everybody. We're going to beat them like a drum. [cheers and applause]
And we were doing that against China. There was a long-time expression that China will take over the world's largest economy. It'll take it over in 2019. Well, in 2019 we were doing so well, 2018, 2017, that China never even came close. We were lapping them. They never came close.
And even President Xi said congratulations. They thought they would be—long time, this is 15, 20 years ago, they said, ""2018, 2019, China will dominate."" Nope, we were doing—It would never happen.
In fact, I said after we started really doing it, as long as we have smart presidents, they'll never catch us because they can't beat our system.
We will have big tax cuts for families and small businesses, and we will have no tax on social security and no tax on tips. [cheers and applause]
So they haven't copied Social Security yet, but they will. Don't forget, he's the one that destroyed our seniors with inflation. Inflation has destroyed our seniors. It's the worst thing that could happen.
The people that behaved the best that did it the American way, that saved their money, they got decimated because their money went down because they couldn't live. They were losing money. With me, they were putting money in the bank and making a lot of money. They were saving a lot of money. After I left, they were losing all of that money they saved.
Kamala wants to spend $1.7 trillion in wasteful spending, causing more inflation. And she says it's a mistake to ask her how she's going to pay for it.
""Please, it's a mistake."" She just said it. She just said something that nobody has any idea what she said, but she said it's a mistake to ask how we're paying for it. Kamala Harris can't answer how she'd pay for any of her new radicalized liberal spending schemes that will bankrupt our country, and do it quickly, destroy social security, destroy Medicare.
She has no clue how'd she pay for $25,000 to every first-time home buyer, including illegals, just like they were going to pay the bills of college students. Unfortunately, that didn't happen and won't happen. They gave up that. Supreme Court gave it up because it was unfair to all of those people. One of the reasons, all of the people for years and years that paid back their loans, and now we're going to give something free, but it didn't happen. It was just talk. He knew it wouldn't happen too. Crooked Joe, he knew that was not going to happen.
No clue how she'd pay for free healthcare for illegals. She wants to give free healthcare to illegals.
Now, you want to stop people from coming into our country, the first thing you do, and you would have to do this immediately, no healthcare. We can't do that. We can't afford it. It's not sustainable, but they're doing it. Just the opposite. Come to America. Live the American dream. We'll give your children free schooling. We'll give you free healthcare. We'll give you pensions. We'll put you into social security. This is why people are pouring into our country—in the caravans. That's a very dangerous trip. Thousands and thousands of people are dying in those caravans coming up to our country, and they're coming up because the promises are being made to them that just can't be kept.
No clue how she'd pay for the $100 trillion, think of that 100 trillion with a T, dollar green new scam. It's a scam. Out of the $100 trillion, you wouldn't—There's not $1 of it that would help our country, not $1 of it.
It'll destroy our country. And no clue how she'd pay for the hundreds of billions of dollars in new foreign aid giveaways. We're giving away money at levels that nobody has ever seen before. No other country would do it. No other country would be so stupid to do it.
That's why it's so important to vote for Trump to stop the reckless spending and the destruction of our country. We will not have a country left. I will stop the special interest giveaways, cut waste, and restore common sense to our government. The Republican Party is the Republican Party of common sense. [cheers and applause]
That's what it is. Kamala will bury American workers in regulations. I will liberate our workers with the largest regulatory cuts ever recorded. We've already done some of them, but she put them right back. They put them right back. Repealing every single job killing regulation of the Biden-Harris administration. The electric vehicle mandate, which is absolutely so crazy, will be gone, and there will be no costly forced transition to all electric cars and trucks.
If you want a gasoline propelled car or a hybrid or an electric car, they're wonderful too, but not all. People need to go longer distances. They want to pay less money. Fantastic. Electric is fantas—Everything is great. You have to be able to buy everything.
They have a mandate. We don't have enough of electricity for ourselves, and now they're talking about putting all the cars on it. Well, it doesn't work because the cars don't go far.
If you'd like to go from here to, let's say Washington to look after we fix the capital up and make it safe again, which will take approximately like quickly,—but after we fix it up, and if you want to drive there, you don't want to stop five times, you want to be able to go there and you want to be able to enjoy it, and you don't want to be mugged or shot or killed in our capitol, which has become very unsafe. It's horribly run, graffiti stained, and we're going to fix it very quickly and beautifully. We're going to make it the most beautiful capitol anywhere in the world, and we're going to make it totally safe. Police are going to do a great job.
Simultaneously, we will modernize our trade policies. The United States has long been taken advantage of by other countries at levels that nobody has any idea. I would sit and look at these trade deals, many of which we renegotiated with Japan, with South Korea, with Canada, Mexico, many. But I'd look at these deals before we did the renegotiations and say, ""Who would make deals like this?"" I mean, they were either crooked or really stupid, one or the other, probably crooked for the most part because I don't think they're stupid. But we had the worst trade deals.
No country's ever had trade deals like. We fixed many of them, made some of them extraordinary. We lose jobs in revenue.
They gain everything. We lose jobs. We lose revenue. They destroy our country. They gain everything, and they wipe out our businesses, which is good for them because then they can supply us with whatever we were making. I stopped it four years ago and I will stop it very quickly again, and we'll be making the product ourselves with our labor.
We will not let countries come in, take our jobs, and plunder our nation into poverty. [cheers and applause]
The way they will sell their product in America without having to pay any substantial tariff for tax is to build their factory in America and build their product in America using only American help, and we have the help. [cheers and applause]
Kamala Harris says that a tariff is a tax on American consumers. She's wrong. It's a tax on a foreign producer. It's a tax on a foreign country, and I proved that better than anybody because I took in hundreds of billions of dollars worth of tariffs on different states, on different countries. And out of all of that money, we had no inflation. We had no inflation.
It also gives you power over that country. If they want to have wars with somebody, we can say no. If you do have wars, we're going to raise your tariffs. Oh sir, we won't have a war. We're okay with it when we've decided not to go after somebody.
One thing a little off this, everybody said, ""Oh, we might have wars with Trump."" We had no wars with Trump. First time in 78 years, we had no wars, other than I finished some like ISIS. [cheers and applause]
100%, defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate.
What they did is Afghanistan, the most embarrassing day in the history of our country. And none of the generals got fired for the incompetence that they showed. Most embarrassing moment. We would've left with dignity and strength. We would've taken our $85 billion worth of equipment. We would've taken our hostages. We lost 13 great, great people.
We had 47 people obliterated the arms, the legs, the face obliterated. What a horrible day it was. What an embarrassment. What a horrible day to have death, to have such injuries. Nobody talks about the 47 people that lost their limbs that will suffer for the rest of their lives.
As I've said many, many times before, as tariffs on foreign countries go up, taxes on American workers and families come down. According to one recent study, a small 10% tariff on foreign-made products will allow massive tax cuts for working families. Create more than 3 million American jobs, raise household incomes by 6%. Think of that. [cheers and applause]
And the 6% equates to $4,200 a year for a household, and generate almost a trillion dollars in economic growth. And it will go very quickly. It will also get rid of a large portion of our deficit.
Because we don't want countries coming in here, stealing our jobs, hurting our country, killing our workers, leaving with everything, and we as usual end up with empty factory buildings that are falling down. We end up with nothing.
We want tariffs. If somebody wants to come in and take our jobs, if somebody wants to come in and sell us their product that's made in their country, that's okay, but they've got to pay tariffs. They've got to pay a price for that. We're going to bring down your taxes at levels never seen before. We're going to pay off debt of our country, because this country owes $35 trillion. But that rapidly can come down.
And remember this, we're sitting on the largest amount of oil and gas. We have, I call it liquid gold. We have more liquid gold than Saudi Arabia. We have more liquid gold than Russia, but we don't use it. We go out and we buy from other countries at ridiculous prices. We buy now from Venezuela, we buy tar. It's not really—It's tar.
And you know where we refine it? At a factory. Only one factory in the world can do it because of the nature of it. It's tar. It's not good stuff. It's in Houston, Texas. So all of that, if you're an environmentalist, all of that's going right into the air in our country. We bring in lots of tar, loads of it. We dump it in Houston, and they refine it.
We have pure stuff. We have the best and we have the most right under our feet. It's liquid gold. And we're going to use it, and we're going to reduce our deficit. We're going to reduce our debt, and we're going to reduce your taxes. We're going to do everything right, and it's going to happen quickly too. [cheers and applause]
And as we reduce burdens on US manufacturers, our workers can make goods better and cheaper right here in our own country, and right here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
We don't need lectures on the economy from a candidate pushing communist price controls. Kamala has no idea what the hell she's doing. Her father is a Marxist professor, and I believe he taught her well. You know he's a Marxist professor. Can you imagine? Does anyone know that? I wonder if they knew that when they did an overthrow or a coup on Joe Biden. I wonder if they knew where she comes from, where she came from, what her ideology is. But you could see it a little bit by this whack job. You know, he said, we are weird. That JD and I are weird. I think we're extremely normal people, like you, exactly like you. He's weird. Did you ever see him go on the stage and go like crazy?
It's like between his movement and her laugh, there's a lot of craziness. I'd say a step further than weird. Weird is a nice word by comparison.
When I'm president, we're going to do things right. And when I was president, we imposed historic tariffs and prices, and we did it all. We did it all. Prices didn't go up. Everybody said, ""Oh, if you do that, prices."" No, the country made less money. That's what happened. Gave us tremendous political leverage over those countries too for things having nothing to do with economics. They heard China, not America. That's why the Biden administration had no choice but to leave them in place. They've left them in place. They wanted to take them off. But so much money comes in from China and other places with the tariffs that I put on, that Joe Biden, as much as he wanted to do his friends a favor, couldn't do him too much money. You couldn't justify it. There was no way to justify it.
And my next term, I will revoke China's most favorite nation trade status. It's very unfair. [cheers and applause]
And by the way, I have great respect for President Xi. I think China and the United States will get along well together. Until COVID came in, that was a step too far. But I had a great relationship with President Xi. I had a great relationship with most of the leaders.
I'll pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if China or any other countries, not just China, the European Union treats us very badly. Nobody knows that. Very badly. We have a 250 billion deficit now with the European Union. But if China, or the European Union, if any other group of countries or country makes us pay a 100% or 200% tariff or tax, we will make them pay a reciprocal tariff or tax of the exact same amount.
So it's basically, you hurt us, we hurt you. It's an eye for an eye, and it's common sense. [applause]
We will ensure that we have 100% domestic American supply chains of all essential goods.
Our supply chain has crashed. And you don't write about it now, but it still crashed. And all you have to do is say, ""Where's the package that was supposed to be here three months ago?"" People aren't getting them. It's very bad what's happened. They've destroyed our supply chain, which is something I didn't think could be done.
COVID proved that if we need it in a crisis, then we must be able to make it in America. We want to rely on ourselves. We have no choice. This is really a matter of national security.
We will bring back electronic production. We're going to bring up electronics too. Electronics, we buy everything —away. When you see the sophistication of the product I just saw at this place, electronics is peanuts by comparison, but pharmaceutical too, it's outside of this country. 95% we're reliant on various other countries, good countries, nothing wrong, but we want to do it ourselves.
They make a tremendous amount of money, and we lose our jobs. And we want to do it ourselves.
Mineral production, car production. We're going to bring back the auto industry. We can do that. We can do better than anybody in the world.
They've stolen 59% of our car making business. The union, the United Auto Workers. I think the people in that union are going to vote for me overwhelmingly, because I'm going to bring car industry back. They are destroying it. When they agreed to all electric cars, they're not going to be made in this country. We'll be making no cars in this country. And I was the one with South Korea, they got the tax put on and extended on the small trucks. And if I didn't have that tax, the most successful product made in this country is the small trucks.
If I didn't get that tax, South Korea and China would be destroying us now with additional product. We saved them. So I hope the autoworkers are listening, because they have a union boss that doesn't have a clue. He doesn't have a clue. It's sad. I wish he did. I don't have to like him. I wish he did. But he doesn't have a clue.
What he's done to the auto business in allowing this to happen, where all of those cars are going to be made in China and it's going to happen quickly. With the help of companies like this one, we will rebuild our hallowed out defense industrial base, ensuring that America is never in a situation where we don't have tanks, missiles, the raw materials to fight and win a war. We have to have those.
What would happen if we had a war? We won't, with me. But you will have World War Three, I believe, without me. But we won't have. But what would happen if we did?
And let's say it was with China, but they give us all of our steel? So we'll have to call China for steel so we can fight a war with them. How stupid are these people?
Upon taking office, I will invoke the Defense Production Act wherever it's necessary to quick—very quickly ramp up capacity of essential products. And I will stop Japan from buying United States steel. [cheers]
We have a foreign country that wants to purchase one of our greatest. If you go back 70 years, our greatest country, our greatest company by far was United States Steel Corporation. That was the big deal. And now we have Japan buying it. They shouldn't be allowed to buy it. We have to make it work. We have to make it work. You don't want to sell US Steel.
This is how we will rediscover the industrial heritage of our country. We will reclaim our manufacturing legacy. We will build up glorious American future fueled by Pennsylvania energy.
You're one of the largest in this country. You're one of the largest producers in the world. She doesn't know that. You're not going to produce. You're going to go from being one of the largest producers in terms of fracking, the energy produced into a non-factor.
Your state's going to be third world, like much of our country is being made third world by these people. They don't have a clue. But it's going to all be made with pride of the US and with Pennsylvania pride, and strengthened by strong, powerful Pennsylvania steel again.
With your vote, we will destroy inflation, bring down prices. And prices are going to come down very substantially.
Achieve incredible economic growth, make America wealthy again, and we will bring back, most importantly, we're going to bring back a thing called the American Dream. The American dream is dead. Right now the American dream is dead.
We're going to bring back the American dream. So vote for Trump on November 5th. We will be the most—[cheers and applause]
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.
CROWD: USA!, USA!, USA!, USA!
TRUMP: Thank you to Pennsylvania.
The reception coming here with the people outside waving, it was a beautiful site. The love that they have for what we're trying to do, and what we will do. I just leave you with this. Vote on November 5th or sooner.
November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country. We're going to turn our country around. We're going to make America great again. Thank you everybody. God bless you. [cheers and applause]
God bless Pennsylvania. God bless America. Thank you very much everybody. [cheers and applause]

ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald J. Trump. [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Nice place by the way. Incredible people outside. You saw the crowds, it was just incredible. [cheers]
And we really feel good about the state and the area. We're doing very well here. Just got a poll that was very good. Got a lot of good polls the last couple of days.
Thank you to the Livingston County Sheriff's Department for welcoming us in such a beautiful way. This was a beautiful welcome, and these are great people. [cheers and applause] These are great people.
And we have, in terms of law enforcement, just about every law enforcement group in the country has endorsed us, as you probably have heard. And there's a reason for that, because I believe in law enforcement, the other group doesn't.
It's always an honor to be with our brave men and women in blue and in brown, frankly, and in various colors because it's not always blue. But these are great people and you just don't do better. They're brave. They're under assault and they have a lot of difficulty with the laws of our land, and we're going to get rid of that difficulty because they shouldn't have difficulty.
Our police men and women have the backs of law-abiding citizens every single day. They take care of what they have to do in some very adverse conditions. And I'm the—when we go back to the White House, you're going to see support the likes of which you haven't seen certainly in four years.
Uh we worked very closely with the police all over the country, as you know, gave them billions of dollars of excess military equipment that was in warehouses all over the country that the Obama administration refused to give. And it was just drawing dust. Magnificent equipment, but it was just getting old, sitting in warehouses.
And I hope you guys got some of it, did you? Because I gave it, and it was billions and billions and it was nothing going to happen, whether it, except the government was paying lots of rents all over the country for big warehouses. And it was an honor to have done it and it helped a lot of the departments very, very much.
I want to thank Livingston County Sheriff Mike Murphy. Mike, thank you. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Where is he? Thank you, Mike. Thank you, Mike. What a great job. So respected, all of them. This group is highly respected. Mason County Sheriff Kim Cole. Kim, thank you. [applause] Van Buren County Sheriff Daniel Abbott. [applause] Thank you, Daniel. President of the Police Officer's Association of Michigan, James Tignanelli. James. [applause] Picking the wrong side. Where he is? Where are you? Come on over here, James. Let's go, get over here. [laughter] Come on. Is he allowed to stand with you guys? [laughter] I don't know. Stand up there, James. How are you? Thank you, James.
Representatives John James and John Moolenaar, these are great warrior people. [applause] Wherever you are. Where's John James? There they—oh, look at you guys. You don't get the best location because you want your constituents to be treated so well, right, huh? Thank you both very much. We appreciate it. Done a great job.
Your next US senator, he's really working hard and I just saw a poll, that—doing very well, Mike Rogers. Mike. Thank you, Mike. Congressional Candidate Paul Young, who is polling beautifully, I think. Paul, good luck. Good luck, Paul. You're going to do it. And Michigan House Republican leader, Matt Hall. [cheers] Matt, thanks. Oh, thanks Matt. Great. You look the role, Matt. Beautiful. Thank you very much, Matt.
CROWD MEMBER: [inaudible]
TRUMP: [laughter] You're right. That'll be next. Thank you very much.
Michigan Senate Republican leader, Aric Nesbitt. [applause] Aric. Thank you, Aric. Nice seeing you again. Doing a good job.
We're here today to talk about how we are going to stop the Kamala crime wave that is going on at levels that nobody's ever seen before. And she is, as you know, the most radical left person ever even thought of for high office, certainly for the office of president.
People don't know the real Kamala, but I do. And people that do what I do, they also know.
But she is so far left that nobody can even imagine and her real thoughts are there. You know—she's changing—they call her a flip flopper at the highest level that they've ever seen in politics because she's come out with policy for years, defund the police. You don't mind defunding, do you fellas? [looks towards police officers] Would you vote for a defunder? [booing] Would you vote—by the way, the people that you protect don't want defunders either, but she's been that until just recently, but she's always been for defunding the police. And the person that she's running with, Tim Walz, is equally far left.
This is the most far left group. Nobody's ever seen anything like it, and the press is giving them a free pass. And you're not going to have—if it was up to them, you wouldn't even have the men behind me, people behind me, representatives behind me. You wouldn't have them. They wouldn't have a job. They think it's going to just police itself. Everything's going to take care of itself.
Her father is, as you know, a Marxist professor, and he obviously did a good job, but this is where she's coming from. And you see her now with a smile, and she's gotten rid of the laugh over the last couple of days. I don't know. I haven't seen her laugh. [laughter] They've told her, ""Don't laugh, please."" [laughter]
But I'll bet inside she was laughing last night when she saw the way Joe Biden left because that was a coup. That was a coup. And I'm no fan of his at all. And it started with the debate, and from that point on, it just got worse and worse. But that was a coup. It was a vicious, violent overthrow of a president of the United States.
Since Comrade Kamala Harris took office, uh her administration's crime statistics show she's presided over a 43% increase in violent crime. These are all government numbers. 43% increase in violent crime. I'll bet the people behind me don't have anything like that. It just gets better. It doesn't get worse. Including a 58% increase in rape, 89% increase in aggravated assault and a 56% increase in robbery. The crime in America, the fact is is out of control.
I watched last night in amazement as they tried to pretend that everything was great, the crime was great, the border was great, there wasn't a problem at all. No inflation, no nothing.
There has been a report that the job numbers over the last period of time were fraudulent. And they—I understand that because I know how the job numbers go. And you want to be a bad person in high office you can be a bad person, but the numbers are going to be revised that the job numbers were far less at nobody's ever seen. 600,000 to a million people—jobs less. And let's see if that turns out to be true, but that's what the rumor is. It was reported by a very respected outfit, group, and we'll see what happens.
But that's a terrible insult to our economy because we were seeing numbers that were okay, not great, but now we're seeing numbers that when they're adjusted are a disaster.
But crime in America is out of control. I'm going to make it, along with the economy, inflation, strong borders and energy dominance, my top priority. I'm including crime in America. Normally, that's done locally. And uh we're going to give the local people a lot of help, like I did initially, but not that much.
We had a lot of great numbers coming out when I was president. Now, we're seeing numbers that are just absolutely horrific. The Democrats are holding their convention in Chicago in order to showcase it. And yet, as you know, on 4th of July weekend, 117 people were shot. Of the 117, 17 were killed. This is 4th of July weekend. And 40 were shot last weekend.
I don't know how many were killed, but assume a lot. And that's a war zone that's worse than Afghanistan that we read about all the time.
Speaking of Afghanistan, the worst and most embarrassing day in the history of our country, in my opinion, we left 13 dead soldiers, 47 obliterated, just obliterated the arms, the legs to face, left people behind, and we left $85 billion worth of equipment behind for the Taliban to use as it sees fit. And they're selling a lot of it because they don't need 700,000 guns and rifles. They don't need 72,000 armor plated vehicles. They're one of the largest sellers of military equipment in the world right now. They're selling our equipment because they said, by the way, would've never happened with me. Abdul would never have done that, but they said we didn't have anybody shot. After my conversations with the leader of the Taliban, uh zero shot in 18 months.
We had nobody lost in 18 months. He knew that he was not going to do that. I knew that. But now you look at what's happened and it's back, we would've kept Bagram. That's the big air base, not because of Afghanistan, but because it's located one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons.
So it's one hour away and we had it one of the biggest air bases in the world. We built it for billions and billions of dollars many years ago. Got the biggest runways, the biggest everything, and we just walked away from it, gave it to them, and now China's occupying it, and I thought that the scene a few days ago of the third anniversary, they call it the Defeat of America, was one of the ugliest scenes that I've seen on television in a long time. I've seen some pretty bad ones. So have you, we're witnessing some pretty bad ones.
Uh they had a parade where the parade was uh all of our equipment, a lot of our equipment, brand new beautiful armor plated trucks coming down a road and people cheering. Not that many people cheering actually, but there were people cheering, but they were making us look very bad. We have a fool, a fool as a president.
They lied last night about things that nobody's ever seen. They lied about soldiers at a grave site. They lied about Charlottesville, they lied about uh inflation. The inflation's been absolutely horrible, absolutely horrible, and everyone knows that we had virtually no inflation. They had 9%, but that wasn't including some of the things that went up more than anything else. They gave themselves a pass. But mothers will no longer be losing their children because of weak liberal policies and politicians that have given up on securing a crime free America. We want a crime free America.
We're going to stop violent crime in the United States, and it's people like this that can do the job better than anybody. They do the job justly and fairly, but there's nobody like these people. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you.
There's nobody like them, so they can do it. They have to be given back their rights and their dignity. They have to be allowed to do their job.
We're going to be uh guaranteeing immunities, and I'm not looking necessarily uh just here, but we have police in various areas that are pretty rough areas. If they do their job, if they're diligent in doing their job, they go after the police officer rather than the criminal. They lose their house, they lose their pension, they lose their family, they lose everything. They lose everything. Then we're going to make sure that doesn't happen.
Over the past four years, the Marxist left has waged a vicious war on law enforcement in our country.
They've taken away the dignity and the spirit and the life of some of these police officers, and that's why you see it.
The crime is so out of control in our country. I mean, you have cities, I will say this, the top 25 almost all are run by Democrats and they have very similar policies. It's just insane. But you can't walk across the street to get a loaf of bread. You get shot, you get mugged, you get raped, you get whatever it may be, and you've seen it and I've seen it, and it's time for a change.
We have to bring back our cities. We have these cities that are great cities where people are afraid to live in America. They're fleeing the cities of our country. What we would consider, what we did consider, you know interestingly like New York when I left for Washington, New York was we had a very bad Mayor de Blasio, but he wasn't there that long and he couldn't ruin what took place.
But uh we had a city that was so wonderful and so thriving, and just in a few short years that changed, New York state is doing terribly. I heard the governor last night speaking so viciously and violently about me, but she doesn't speak about what they've done to destroy the state.
The law enforcement has been decimated.
The judges, what's gone on with the judges in New York? Nobody—there's no justice. We're not getting justice in New York. And yet she speaks so bravely about things that she shouldn't be speaking about.
But you look at radical liberal Kamala Harris, she's been the ringleader for this anti-crime and the anti-police crusade. It's a real anti-police crusade.
They uh just have it out for the police. Nobody knows why. I don't understand why from a common sense. I like to say the Republican Party is now the party of common sense. Conservative, yeah, I guess conservative. It doesn't matter. It's the party of common sense.
We want to have borders. We want have strong police protection. We want a military that can protect us. We want great school, school choice ideally. We want have a good life. We want to be safe.
But let's review Kamala's pro crime, anti-police record. She repeatedly endorsed defunding the police, which I said, and it said a level, and it never goes away. When you're a defunder or when you are even a politician, your first thought usually is the thought that you go with. If she ever had a chance, she would do whatever she could to defund the police.
Cause, that's where her spirit is. That's where her heart is, and we can't have a president like that. She sponsored a bill to strip police officers of legal protection leaving you at the mercy of the lawless Marxist prosecutors who want to lock up police officers for sport.
They lock them up in many cases long before they lock up the criminal and they go after them too violently. They don't go after the criminals. Murderers are released two hours after the murder.
She wants to bankrupt the police unions. She wants to destroy policemen in general, and they ruin your lives, your jobs, and they ruin everything you've lived for, everything you've felt that you want to make great. You want to make our country great.
When I'm President of the United States, again, we will never even think about or mention the words defund the police. We'll never think about that again. It's got to be put away. [cheers and applause] It's a bad situation. It's a bad concept.
The concept is so chilling and so horrible to think that what we should be thinking about is the opposite of defunding, refunding you called. We'll refund, but we want to help the police.
They have a very dangerous job lately. I see if somebody—I was with a great family a few months ago, opens the door to a car and gets shot and they have all sorts of protection for the people in the car. You can't have your gun even close to being drawn. You don't know what's happening. A lot of the windows are dark, so you don't know who's in there, but the door opens and just gets shot.
Great police officer and many, many cases. A dangerous—it's a dangerous business and we have to give them protection and we have to give them love and respect, and that's what we're going to do.
We were doing it and they're not doing it now.
We'll give our law enforcement heroes the kind of protection and the resources that they so dearly deserve, and I will crack down on local Marxist DAs who refuse to enforce the law. They refuse to put murderers in jail, and you see it all over as the district attorney of San Francisco.
Kamala Harris was one of the worst and one of the first Marxist prosecutors in America. She said that uh, and some people said she was the godmother of both sanctuary cities because this was a while ago. This was when it all started, and that horrible shoplifting epidemic.
She shielded illegal alien crack dealers from deportation. She fought like hell to have crack dealers not deported. She came up with a concept of $950 and below. You don't even get prosecuted. $950, so guys are walking into stores with calculators to figure out, do you know that they have calculators?
They adding it up. They want to make sure they're under 950, but it didn't matter because they didn't prosecute the ones that went over either.
She ignored the pleas of victims, families members and refused to seek the death penalty against, as an example, an illegal alien, MS 13 gang member, these are the worst gangs in the world who murdered an innocent man and his two sons were absolutely no reason. They said, ""Why did you do it?"" He said, ""I felt like it. I felt like it.""
So uh when Kamala, until recently was called a Marxist prosecutor, she didn't even disclaim the title. She sort of liked it. As the California Attorney General, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon and rape of an unconscious person as a nonviolent crime. All of them were redefined by her as nonviolent.
Kamala Harris supports abolishing cash bail nationwide.
Cash bail has been a disaster. When you abolish the no cash, no cash, don't worry about cash, you murdered somebody, don't worry about it. That was really the beginning of problems for New York. Big problems for New York, but elsewhere also.
But it means releasing violent criminals immediately after arrest. No money involved. Don't worry about it. Go home. Enjoy yourself. Many of them disappear. You never find them again. Many of them immediately start killing again. It's just a crazy situation.
She supports ending jail sentences for parole violators. She considers a parole violation not to be serious. When the violent mobs of looters and anarchists tried to burn down Minneapolis in 2020. Kamala Harris raised money, bailed to bail out the arsonists and the riders and the killers. People were killed. Many people were killed. Compare that to J6. Nobody was killed. Nobody was killed. There weren't fires set.
They burned down the city. They were burning down Minneapolis, and she went out and not only did she work a little bit with them, she worked a lot with them. She worked to get them out and to set them free.
One of the criminals Kamala helped bail out of jail was Shawn Michael Tillman, one of the worst, a dangerous repeat offender. Had a horrible record of violence. With Kamala's help, she was set free. He was set free. Soon, went on to murder a man on a train platform for no reason whatsoever in St. Paul, shooting him six times in the head and in the torso. No reason whatsoever. What's the reason? No reason, just felt like it.
Kamala Harris will deliver crime, chaos, destruction and death. If she's allowed to be the President of the United States you'll see levels of crime that you've never seen before.
I will deliver law, order, safety and peace, and I will protect those who protect us. These people protect us. These are unbelievable people. They protect us. We have to protect them. We have to give them hope because so many are leaving the forces. I can't speak for this group because I'd love to work for them.
I would be joining them in two minutes. It looks like a nice job there. So they look because they've handled themselves and crime and everything else in a stern way, and it's probably uh a lot easier to do. Maybe we should switch them around to different territories of your state, of our nation and let some other guys take—would you like that fellers, I have a feeling you don't want that? I don't want to embarrass you. [laughter] I don't want to say any particular names of locations, but I can think of a big one in the state.
I'd love to have them working there during the election, I can tell you, but no, but they have it all very much under control, and that's the way it should be.
So we're going to make a record investment in hiring, retention, and training of police officers. We're losing tremendous numbers of police officers. These are men and women that want to be police officers and they're just leaving. We're going to get you reinforcements and we're not going to be doing the negative.
Let's pay them much less or let's defund entirely. Let's pay them. There's a movement on now. We won't defund, but we'll pay them much less money. No. No. I've never realized how dangerous a job it was.
I have some papers here where if you watch the event last night—this is by the way, [holds up chart titled Illegal Immigration into the U.S.] my all time favorite chart, which is because if you've watched last night, you wouldn't know that border was so bad. This was right here, this arrow on the bottom, lowest ever. This is made by border patrol. That's the lowest ever we had for illegal aliens coming into our country. And that was the week I left office. That's the lowest ever.
Now, this chart is very dear to my heart for another reason. This was the chart. I said, ""Let me see. Let me see it.""
But it says a lot, and we had a couple of instances last night where things were mentioned so I got it. Did crime rise under Trump and fall under Biden? They said it rose under Trump. And they go, ""No, the opposite is true."" Take a look at this here. [holds up report] It said, ""Is it true, did crime rise under Trump and fall under Biden?"" ""No, the opposite is true."" This was a study group that went out and doesn't care. They do the numbers.
And there was another one that a historical comparison of the collapse of law enforcement in U.S. cities. The drop in arrest rates over the last few years is without precedent, lowest arrest rates we've ever seen. They don't arrest people anymore. And they shouldn't arrest people for saying the election was rigged, but they liked that.
They go after guys like me, but they don't go after people that kill people. It's a shame what's happened in our country. But we're going to turn it around. We're going to win big and we're going to turn it around. We're going to turn it around fast. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you.
We'll bust up and dismantle the gangs, savage criminal networks and bloodthirsty cartels, and we will stop the Fentanyl, and we'll make sure that Kamala Harris has, and all of the people that she's allowed to come across the border—don't forget she was the border czar, whether she wants to hear it or not.
CROWD MEMBER: Still is.
TRUMP: She still is. Thank you. In fact, you could do it right now. They like to talk, it's all nonsense, that Donald Trump stopped a bill. I was opposed to it. So was everyone else. It was the weakest bill. Under that bill, millions of people would've been allowed to come in. This was a weak bill. But you didn't need a bill. I didn't have a bill. I said, ""Close the border."" And that's how we got to those numbers, the lowest ever recorded. I said, ""Close the border."" I didn't have a bill. I didn't need a bill. She doesn't need a bill.
Biden doesn't know where he is, so where is he? Whatever happened to him? He got out. He got out. He's now sunbathing. He's in a beach someplace.
But all he would have to do as president or her is say, close up the border and it's closed. But they don't want to close the border because when they first took over, I had built hundreds of miles of wall and I had 200 miles of wall in addition to what I said I was going to do because certain areas needed it. As we closed areas, other areas became um very, very strong in terms of people wanting to come through. So I bought 200 additional miles. It would've taken about three weeks to erect it.
We're all set to erect it, then we had a terrible election take place, terrible election. And everybody here knows that.
And I realized that they don't want to do it. And they actually sold that. And that was designed to the highest specifications of when you look at the steel, it's steel, it's concrete, 5,000 pound concrete inside and then rebar. And it also has a lot of technology wires and things in it for high technology. It was designed to the highest specs of the border patrol.
I wanted actually concrete plank. I would've done a beautiful job with precast like you have in parking garages, long span. It's called long span precast. But they had to be able to see through. I understand that. They needed certain things that you can't do with concrete plank.
So we did that, and very expensive to do because you needed all sorts—in other words, they wanted the steel, they wanted the concrete. It's all different methods of very hard to cut it, very hard to do it when you have different substances. And then very powerful rebar inside.
And what happened is, as soon as they came in, they sold it for 5 cents on the dollar. They sold this stuff. Somebody made a lot of money because that steel is very valuable. But they sold all of that hundreds of miles of stuff. You saw it stacked up for a long period of time where they stacked it up in an area because Texas wanted to use it and finish the job.
We built hundreds of miles. But Texas wanted it. They would've paid for it. They refused to sell it to Texas. They refused to sell it to Arizona. And they refused to sell it to anybody. They sold it to the junkyards, I guess, and 5 cents on the dollar.
On day one, I will seal the border. I will stop the invasion. We had the border sealed. I had Mexico, I had thousands of soldiers from Mexico, free of charge. I said to the president, ""You must give us soldiers because they're coming through. The caravans are coming through your country."" ""No, no, no, I cannot do that."" I said, ""Yes, you'll do that. If you don't do that, I'm going to put tariffs on your cars."" And he said, ""I will do that, sir."" [laughter] And he did it. He did it very quickly.
And it really, you guys heard all about it, made a great difference. We had thousands of Mexican soldiers guarding our borders that, look, they're coming through your country. You have to guard your southern border, which is their border on the other side. And all of a sudden they started and we had it. We had remain in Mexico. It's called Remain in Mexico policy, which we never had. And they stayed in Tijuana, different places, hundreds of thousands of people that didn't come into our country until they were checked. And then if they were good, we let them in. And if they weren't, we wouldn't let them in.
And we worked well with Mexico, actually. But now Mexico has really taken advantage of our country. They want 200—they want billions of dollars just to talk. They wouldn't say that with me. They wanted, I think $2 billion to talk, right? ""We will talk. We want $2 billion before we even start."" That wouldn't happen with me. I would say, ""Oh really? Is that right? That's the end of trade with Mexico."" And they would say, ""Sir, we will give you two billion. How about that?""
So I'll send Kamala's illegal aliens back home where they belong. We have a problem because when I came in, they wouldn't accept MS-13 gang members. I told the generals we're going to get the gang members out. ICE and border patrol, the job these people do. But ICE would go into the country, get the MS-13 gang members out, the meanest, the most vicious.
They kill people with knives. They killed two young students walking to school, two beautiful, young sixteen-year-old girls walking to school. They killed them up and chopped them up into pieces with knives. Dead.
And ICE goes in and they go into those packs of rough, rough people and ICE is rougher than they are. These are incredible, brave patriots.
A lot of people wouldn't want that job.
You see fists and feet, you see everything flying. And then two minutes later, they stand up and they grab them and they throw them into what they used to call a paddy wagon. They put them into planes, say, ""Take them out."" The countries wouldn't take them back under President Obama.
And I said, ""Really? They're not going to take them back? Well, if they're not going to take them back, I'm going to stop paying them."" I said, ""How much money do we pay these countries, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and others?"" I said, ""How much money do we pay?"" $750 million. I said, ""Good. Inform them we're not paying them anymore.""
And the following morning, I got calls from all of these countries. ""Sir, sir, there must be a misunderstanding. We would love to take them back. [cheers and applause] We would love to have MS-13. We would love to have MS-13 back in our country. It would be a great honor to have them back.""
And before we get too far, we're almost finished, but before we get too far, I want to tell you that we have criminals from all over the world pouring into our country right now. [looks towards police] Your job will never be obsolete. It will never be obsolete, unfortunately. It'd be nice if we could have peace, but we're not going to have peace. And this is something we're going to have to live with for a long time.
She has allowed millions of people, open border, to flow into our country totally unchecked, totally unvetted. And they come from jails and prisons, slightly different. They come from mental institutions, all mental institutions all over the world.
This isn't just in South America. People think it's South America. It's from Africa, Asia, the Middle East. A lot of people coming from the Congo in Africa, the Congo, rough, rough, rough. And they're uh prisoners. They're prisoners. And we say, ""Where do you come from?"" ""Africa."" ""Where in Africa?"" ""Prison."" ""What did you do?"" ""We don't want to say."" They turn out to be murderers.
These are rough people. And we're allowing them into our country from all over the world. From South America, yes, but from all over the world.
They come from insane asylums. And many are terrorists. So we have prisoners, mental patients, mental institution patients, terrorists pouring into our country totally unchecked, unvetted.
We have some of the worst terrorists in the world. We know where they are approximately, but we don't know too much. But we know they're the worst. We have the worst terrorists in the world pouring into our country. And she's the president and wants to be the President of the United States.
She's vice president. She could do it. She's in charge of the border. She could have closed up the border. She should have closed it up.
They could have told Mexico, ""If you don't do it, we're not going to do something."" We're not going to have trade. We're not going to deal with you. We're not going to let you sell your cars into the United States at these ridiculous, where they took 32% of our car industry over many years. They took it out of Detroit. They took it out of different places. But they took it and they took it big from this state, from South Carolina, from a lot of different places. They took 32%. And I think now the number is bigger.
You know, I don't know if you know that they're building some of the biggest car plants in the world right now in Mexico. Wouldn't have happened with me. Right now in Mexico. And China's the one building them, and they think they're going to build, make these cars and then release them into the United States without tax. It's not going to happen. We'll put a hundred percent to a 200% tariff. We're not going to let it happen, because all of our jobs from your state will be gone.
And I watched this union head, he's an incompetent guy. He's approving for what he did for what he's allowed every job, every autoworker here will be out of a job within three years if I'm not elected, every autoworker in the state. They're all going to be made in China. They're going to an all-electric policy. Well, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any country in the world, but we don't have for what you need for an electric car.
But China does, and its territories do and we're not going to let it happen. But they're building some of the biggest plants.
And I have a friend who builds plants. He said, ""Some of the biggest in the world,"" I think he's doing them, ""are being built in Mexico."" And they're going to sell cars, produce them, and sell them in this country with no taxes. It's not going to happen. I told him, I said, ""You better hope I don't win.""
Always dangerous to say these things. Maybe that's why I get shot at and other people don't, right, John James? [laughter] That's probably why I get shot at. Other people, they will protect other people because they can't believe they got so lucky. But I have to do what I have to do. I have to do the right thing.
The Border Czar Kamala Harris has allowed hordes of illegal alien criminals to literally stampede into our country. We're going to end that on day one. We're going to close our border. We're going to get all of the bad ones out, and we're going to get them out fast. In Shelby Township, Michigan, earlier this year, thirty-two-year-old, previously deported illegal alien, monster, was arrested for repeatedly sexually assaulting a young girl under the age of 13. Local law enforcement described the crimes as absolutely horrific and says he had many other victims, including death is involved. Death. Young girls.
In St. Joseph County, Michigan, an illegal alien was recently charged with breaking into a home and sexually assaulting two very little girls, very badly assaulting. In Mississippi, just days ago, an illegal alien child predator was charged with raping a ten-year-old boy. And there were other cases where they were raping ten-year-old boys and girls. And in many cases, they were dead. They were killed.
Last week, in Coney Island, two Kamala migrants were arrested for the rape of a forty-six-year-old woman, woman who was loved by so many people, throwing her to the ground and raping her over and over again, and then working her over with a knife to her throat. One of them had previously been arrested for raping another woman, but he was shielded from deportation by the New York City sanctuary laws, which Kamala strongly supports. She wants it very much. The woman said he didn't want to rape me, he wanted to kill me. She thought she was dead. She survived, but she thought she was dead. She said he didn't want to rape me, he wanted to kill me. This is what we're allowing into our country.
And then you hear, ""Oh no, the people coming in, they're much less violent than the people"" That's not right. They're much more violent and that they make a hat. Sheriff, they make a hat, and I don't want to brag, but it says Trump was right about everything. And if you look, whether it's the border, this, I've been right about everything. Unfortunately. I wish I wasn't. [applause]
So when I return to the White House, we will stop the plunder, rape, slaughter, and destruction of our American suburbs, our cities and towns.
And I think that women living in the suburbs, I keep hearing about the suburban woman doesn't like Trump. Well, I think it's a fake poll because why wouldn't they like me? I keep the suburbs safe. I stopped low-income towers from rising right alongside of their house, and I'm keeping the illegal aliens away from the suburbs. I think that they like me a lot. I think it's a lot of fake polls.
We've seen a lot of fake polls over the years. I was not supposed to win anything, and we won the big one. We won it and did a lot better the second time than I did the first. But women want to have safety. They want to have a strong military. They want to have a strong police force. They want to be in their house and they want to be safe. [cheers and applause] They don't want to have people pouring into their doors and you can't do anything about it.
So I think that's number one thing. I hope they like my personality. I have a nice personality. But to me it wouldn't be very important, the personality.
They want to be safe and they want people like this happy, and they want people like this taken care of properly because those are the people that keep them safe.
So we'll shut down all deadly sanctuary cities throughout the country because all they do is they shield criminals. They basically shield criminals from prosecution.
I will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement. We're going to put a lot of immigration enforcement. We're going to close down the border day one.
And we are going to—just so you understand, I am not a radical at all. I'm just a common sense person that was successful in what I did because of the same thing. We are going to let people, and we want people, to come into our country. A lot of people, we need them. We need them for jobs. We need them for everything.
We want people to come in, but they have to come in through a process. They have to come in legally. And we can let a lot of them come in, but John, we want them to come into our country legally. [applause] We don't want to let people come in who murdered 19 people and then you hire that person in a plant and all of a sudden you notice that people are being killed all over town. We want them to come in legally.
On day one, we'll begin the largest domestic deportation operation in the history of our country, bigger than Dwight Eisenhower. Dwight Eisenhower was very—he was sort of a moderate person, but he hated when people poured into our country and he was very strong on deportation. We will remove all criminal aliens immediately. All of the criminals. We start with that. We're going to get them out of here fast. Nothing good is going to happen with thousands of terrorists being in our country.
We had one month where border patrol was actually um does a chart, and I don't believe this. I love it in a certain way, but I don't. They said in 2019, zero terrorists came in. Now, I don't believe that, but it's an awfully good statistic. But it was very few that came in. We were very tough on that. We had everybody check so carefully and they added, actually, in 2019, they had zero.
Now, you have thousands of terrorists coming into our country. Thousands of terrorists. These are the people that blew up the World Trade Center. Bad things will happen.
And if I'm elected, we're going to get them the hell out of here and we're going to get them out of here fast. Very fast. And I told you that other countries who really, they put their people into groups, they send them up here, and by the thousands.
The caravans, I think it was the name that I came up with, I don't know, maybe somebody will say ""he's lying about that, somebody else used the term 14 days earlier."" But we came up because it just seemed like an appropriate term. It's a caravan of thousands of people. We have one caravan coming up right now, thousands of people that go right into the country. But I call these—they wouldn't take the MS-13 people back or other criminals back. And the generals said, ""we are just not able to do it, sir, because they won't take them back.""
They'd put planes on the runways so that you couldn't land the plane. They'd block up the bus lanes so you couldn't bring the buses and you couldn't get them back.
And when I told them that they wouldn't get any more money, I said, ""let them know they're delinquent, they broken the deal. We're not going to get any more money."" We paid them, for years, hundreds of millions of dollars. The next morning, all three countries called me, like clockwork, separately. ""Sir, is there a misunderstanding? I understand that perhaps you would like to talk to us."" I said, ""yeah, you're sending people into"" And they're sending them, by the way. They don't want them. They're sending them.
All of the countries are sending them, and now they're coming in because of her, because she's so pathetic and weak at the border. The worst job. The worst border czar in history. [applause] I can tell you that. Whether she's a czar or just in charge of the border, it doesn't matter. But they're sending them in levels that we've never seen before and they're destroying our country.
But they all said, all three, it was almost like identical conversations, it was, ""sir, is there anything we can do to make up for this misunderstanding?"" I said, ""yep, you take your MS-13, and you take your gang members and you take your criminals and your drug dealers. We're sending them back and we're sending them back today.""
And we sent thousands and thousands of people back. This has stopped for years. Under Bush, it stopped and under Obama it stopped. But this had been taking place for years, and I only found out about it, I said, ""that's good. Get them out.""
I don't want to put them in our jails because we put them in our jails, what are we going to do? Keep them for 50 years, 60 years? And the expense. The really bad ones, we did do that, though, however, because we don't want them coming back.
But all of them said, ""sir, we would be delighted to take MS-13 back. This would be a great honor. They're such lovely people."" And we took them out by the thousands. We took MS-13. ICE took MS-13 out of our country by the thousands and thousands and they received them, and that's the way. It's just another little story, but it's a story that's very important because I can't see a guy like Biden making that call.
Do you think Biden thinks at night, ""gee, how are we going to get MS-13 out?"" He doesn't know he's alive. He didn't know he's alive. And this one is just a Marxist. She's a Marxist, Communist person, and we're not ready for a Communist president, okay? We're not ready for it. We're going to destroy our country.
Under my leadership, no community will be surrendered to violent criminals. No citizen will be abandoned to migrant crime.
We have a new form of crime. It's called migrant crime, and it's probably more vicious than the crime that we already have, which is pretty vicious. These people are vicious. And please don't let anyone convince you that our criminals, and we have more crime. They are sending massive number of criminals.
And you've heard me say this before, Venezuela crime is down 72%. 72. Because they've taken their criminals out of Caracas, they've taken their criminals out of all of their cities, all of their areas, all over the country, and they're sending them to us. And I'm amazed that they're not doing it quicker, to be honest with you. It's happening fast. They're also emptying out the jails.
And this is true all over the world. They're emptying out their prisons and they're taking their criminals off the streets. They're taking their drug dealers and their crime rates are down at levels that nobody's ever seen before.
And everyone says, ""oh, so-and-so's doing a great job running such-and-such a country."" No, they're not. They're just very intelligent. I would do it, if I were them. I would do it much faster. I can't believe they still have some left. But their jails are getting to be very empty. And what they're doing is they're literally dropping them in. They're busing them in and they're bringing them in and they're saying, ""don't ever come back. If you come back, you get the death penalty,"" or ""if you come back, you get killed. Don't ever come back.""
And you see the crime statistics are unbelievable. If you look at the jails, the jails are—they've never been so low in the world. I'm talking all over the world because they're sending their criminals to the United States of America and they're saying, ""don't ever come back.""
And their jails are being emptied and their criminals are being taken off the streets and their crime rates are plummeting. But that's what we want for our country, so we're sending those people back and these are the people that can do it. [applause]
We're going to have a reformed Department of Justice. We'll, once again, be a friend and partner to our great local police and police officers, general, and we'll be working with victims of crime very closely, but we'll not be working with the criminals that commit the crime. We're going to change it around.
Right now, the criminal has a lot more respect within our Department of Justice than the victims. We're going to be working with the victims. We're going to get the gangsters, the drug dealers, the dangerous offenders behind bars, and we're going to get them ideally out of our country, ideally, except in extreme cases. We have some extreme cases where they've murdered many people. And in that case, we want to make sure they're away.
But the amount of crime that we have is unbelievable and the lack of crime that these other places. It just makes so much sense, doesn't it? That's all common sense too. They're taking their criminals and they're bringing them to the United States and they look so great, and cities like Caracas, which was a very dangerous place to be, these are cities that have opened up, they have new life. But our country is suffering.
And you know, they just got here over the last two years, mostly over the last couple of years, during this administration, during our great border czar who wants to be our president. They'll be laughing.
Watch President Xi, will be laughing. Putin will be laughing. They'll all be laughing.
By the way, the war with Russia would've never started with Ukraine, would've never started if I was President. October 7th would've never happened. Iran was broke. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for Hezbollah. This is a very dangerous time that we're in. It's dangerous in terms of crime and all, but it's very dangerous in terms of a possible World War III.
We're very close to World War III and people don't realize it. We're closer than we've ever been. I think ever since World War II. But this would be the war of wars because of weaponry. This isn't, as I say, two army tanks going back and forth shooting at each other. The level of power, the level of weaponry that there is in the world today is so bad. It's so dangerous. It's so bad. And you need the right person to be President.
We had no war when I was President, except that I totally defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate. Everyone said it would take five years. It took me like about four weeks because we have a great military.
We have great generals. Not the ones you see on television, not the ones that did the Afghanistan botchery, but we have great military people. I know them, and they're never going woke. You keep hearing our militaries going woke. The top people would like to see it, but it's never going to—these not people, just like these people will never be—[turns to police officers behind him] Do you promise you'll never be woke? [laughter] I don't see a lot of wokeness. There's not a lot of wokeness. [applause]
I don't think so. But we're going to stand up for law-abiding citizens of America. We're going to be really, I think, an inspiration to the world. But we have to start by remedying a situation that was caused by somebody that right now is running for President of the United States.
She would be a disaster as President. I love our country. I didn't need this. I didn't have to do this. I didn't need to get indicted by any time I fly over a state, they indict you. I got indicted more than the great Alphonse Capone, right? For nothing. My father's looking down, my mother's looking down. He was such a good boy. I don't know what happened.
But I didn't need this. I had a beautiful life. But to me, I wouldn't change it for the world because we're going to take this country, we're going to make it safe again, and we're going to make America great again. And I want to thank everybody for being here, and God bless you all. [cheers and applause] Thank you.

    ANNOUNCER: Please welcome Kid Rock [cheers and applause]
KID ROCK: Wow, Thank you. [cheers and applause]
Thank you. Good afternoon. Welcome uh welcome to Detroit Rock City, as we say. [cheers and applause]
And uh no matter what your background is, what your politics are, any of that. Before we get going here, those of you serving, who have served, I'm sure I speak forever when I say thank you for your service. [cheers and applause]
Um I'd just like to talk for two seconds about my service and there's a point to this. So if it sounds like a little toot of my own horn or a pat on my back, there's a point to this. Uh probably some of the most rewarding, the most rewarding things I've done in my life and career have been being able to perform for our troops all over the world. From Kosovo, Germany, Afghanistan, Iraq, UAE, Turkey, Italy, England, all across the U.S. But how did that start? [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
But I want to tell you a little story of how that started. Many moons ago, some of you younger ones maybe weren't even walking yet. There was a horrible attack, a terrorist attack in Yemen on one of our ships called the USS Cole, where 17 sailors lost their lives. And when they were getting towed out of that harbor, you can imagine their brothers and sisters, people serving with them were pretty upset, pretty pissed off, but the upper brass said they could play patriotic music while they're getting pulled out of there. And one of those wise guys put on a little song by myself called American Badass, and they were pretty upset. I got a few pictures with these guys after losing 17 of their brothers and sisters. They got F Yemen across their chests and a couple middle fingers in the air. And it gave me chills when I found out about it.
But more importantly, my mother, who's with me today, just celebrated her 80th birthday. [applause] It was her, who I might note that her father, my grandfather and my uncle and her brother served in World War II and Vietnam, suggested she said, ""You know, should do something to help out with them."" And this was kind of before all the crazy wars and everything in the Middle East broke out. And I said, ""You know what? You're right."" And I was raised to be very patriotic and love my country. And, and so it just happened we were playing in Virginia where we have a big presence in our military and the Navy and I was able to play a show there and donate that money to the families of those 17 sailors that lost their lives.
And that was because one reason, because of my mom, Susan Ritchie. So how about an applause for mama Rock who's here tonight? [cheers and applause]
She's a little shy. She's a little shy. Probably back there cutting it up with the president. [laughter] I also apologize, I did not get the dress memo today clearly. But enough of me rambling on here. There she is. Hi mom. Love you.
Now, enough of me rambling on. Once again, welcome to our beautiful city, Detroit. I'm so proud to be from in and around here. It's great to be back, especially with so many of you great patriots.
So let's bring on the man now, right? Probably want to hear somebody else speak. [cheers] Well, how about we give a big old Detroit welcome, a huge military salute and welcome to our 45th and soon to be 47th President of the United States, President Donald J. Trump.
[music: Lee Greenwood, God Bless the USA.]
TRUMP: Thank you.
Having Kid Rock, sometimes referred to as Bob, I call him Bob, but he's a great guy. I'll tell you that, he's a great guy and a talented one, and it's an honor to be with all of you incredible patriots, really an honor, a great one.
And I'm thrilled to be here in Detroit with the incredible men and women of our National Guard. Very special people.
I've had no greater honor in life than to serve as your Commander in Chief, and you are always ready and always there for us and for the President of the United States, you are always there for me, I will tell you and I'm always going to be there for you. [cheers and applause] Thank you.
And we're doing very well as you probably see. And hopefully I can say when I'm back in the White House, I'll get you the support, funding, training, and equipment you need, and I will get you the pay raises that you've really deserved for a long time. [cheers and applause] We'll get it taken care of. For a long time.
I want to thank the Chairman of the National Guard Association of the United States, Major General Janson D. Boyles, and also Vice Chair Major General Jimmie Cole. [applause] Thank you both. Thank you very much.
I also want to thank members of Congress, very special warriors and patriots, they're very strong people. They love our country. Lisa McClain. Where's Lisa? She's so incredible.[applause] Lisa, thank you. Thank you, Lisa. John James. [applause] John, thank you. John James is a star and doing really well. Thanks John. Tim Walberg and Michael Waltz. Thank you very much Michael and Tim. And again, I want to thank Kid Rock for being here. He's really been a great friend of mine for a long time.
Each and every one of the guard members here today inherits the proud spirit of the citizen soldier running all the way back to the Minutemen who stood against tyranny at Concord Bridge. Has everybody heard of Concord Bridge? Yes, I think so. You carry forward the legacy of Old Hickory division that earned more medals of honor than any division in the army in World War I and the North Dakota Guardsmen who've walked through hellfire at Guadalcanal. [applause]
And it was the Air National Guard that thundered into the skies to defend us on 9/11. We all remember that all too well. And when our country is hit by fire, flood, or vicious storm, America turns to the National Guard because we know we can always count on you. We always can count on you. I've counted on you a lot.
The National Guard is America's first and last line of defense, and you do not get the credit you deserve. But actually, you do because down deep everybody knows it. You get a lot of credit in your own way, a little bit different. But we really respect and appreciate the job you do. Thank you to every Guardsman for your selfless service.
I want to thank also our amazing National Guard families because, especially the spouses and the children—[cheers and applause], I mean, let's face it, without which you would never be the same. You'd never be the same. But they sacrifice so much.
All of us in this room have something very special in common. We're all proud, hard-working citizens who have stepped forward to defend American freedom. And we continue to do that. And it's why I'm here today because America's future is under threat like never before right at this moment in my opinion, our country is at the most dangerous level we've ever been.
And I hate to say this, but we have a president who went on vacation a week ago and now he came back and he went on vacation again. And we have people that are fighting all over the place and threatening our country as we speak. I don't think we've ever been closer to World War III than we are right now. It's a terrible thing.
Our country is being destroyed by a radical political class that sends our guardsmen and women to defend the borders of distant foreign nations while they surrender our own borders to an invasion right here at home, the likes of which we've never seen before.
You miss birthdays and holidays deploying overseas in the global war on terror. Only Kamala Harris is letting terrorists come into our country at record numbers and letting Jihadists pour into our homeland by the thousands and thousands and thousands. Can't do that.
And while you have risked your lives to defend our rights and liberties and our borders, our opponents have waged war on those liberties from the White House, attacking free speech, censoring dissidents, and trying to put their political opposition in jail. Never happened before.
I'm in this fight to defeat the corrupt political class in Washington that's hurting you very badly, whether we know it or not, and to reclaim America's future as a free and sovereign nation ruled by the American people.
When I'm back in the White House, we will expel the warmongers, the profiteers, and take over our government and we will restore world peace and it will be again, peace through strength. [cheers and applause]
On day one, I will seal the border and I will stop the invasion of millions of people into our country. [applause]
We will find and remove the terrorists and jihadists who have infiltrated our soil. And under my leadership, we'll bring back the values that you enlisted your lives to defend: sovereignty, liberty, free speech, and fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law.
We are not just going to make America great again. We're going to make American democracy great again. We're going to bring it back.
My opponent, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are promising the exact opposite. They want endless war, open borders, voting rights, and free healthcare for illegal aliens, Soviet-style price control, censorship, unlimited migration from terrorist hotspots and unchecked power for the deep state. This fight is no longer between Democrats and Republicans. This is a fight between communism and freedom. It's very serious fight.
That's why millions of traditional Democrats, including FDR Democrats, JFK Democrats, independents, and old-fashioned liberals are joining our movement. Our poll numbers are great. We're uniting forces to end the endless foreign wars, stop the censorship, end weaponization of our government, defend our borders, rebuild our middle class, protect the health of our children and, above all, to restore our republic and vanquish the corruption that's all over Washington D.C. right now.
Three days ago, I was honored to receive the endorsement of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. We're very proud. [applause] Thank you. We're very proud to welcome Bobby to our cause. He's really a terrific guy. He's a terrific person and he's going to do a lot of great things. I have no doubt about it. He's got some very good ideas. Some ideas that people weren't listening to, it's turned out to be right.
And today I'm honored to officially welcome another true American patriot, a 17-year veteran of the Hawaii Army National Guard, a four-term Democrat congresswoman. Very, very popular. The former vice chair of the National Democratic Party and a 2020 Democrat candidate for the United States presidency. She was a very good candidate. Every time she ran, she was good. She did well. She decided to leave. She couldn't take it anymore. But she is very special. And I didn't know this, but she was a lieutenant colonel. That's not bad, lieutenant colonel. [laughter] Not bad. I didn't know that. I just found out. I said, ""Put it down. You gotta put that down. That's bigger—that's better than all the other stuff I read."" But no, she's a special person. She's got great common sense, great spirit. She loves our country and she loves the people in this room. Tulsi Gabbard. Tulsi, please. [cheers and applause]
TULSI GABBARD: Thank you very much.
TRUMP: Have a good time.
GABBARD: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Aloha.
CROWD: Aloha
GABBARD: I know we got Hawaii in the house here. [cheers] There we go. It is a privilege to be here with all of you, my brothers and sisters in uniform, especially on this day of all days. I had the privilege of joining President Trump this morning at Arlington Cemetery, where he joined two Gold Star families and loved ones of Staff Sergeant Hoover and Sergeant Gee, both of whom were two of the 13 killed in the Abbey Gate attack three years ago today in Kabul.
And I can tell you, as we were there, as he laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, joining these Marines loved ones, I felt the sorrow that he shared with them in their loss. I felt and saw his sincere appreciation for these servicemen and women who paid the ultimate price and their loved ones who continue to grieve to this day.
This is personal for me as I know it is for so many of you here. This is real. It's not just words. I first deployed to Iraq in 2005 with the Hawaii Army National Guard as a member of Charlie Med. [applause] As those of you who were deployed during that time know, it was at the height of the war, and sadly, we took many casualties. And every day we were confronted with that high human cost of war and that sadness as we boarded the plane when we left, that we were leaving some of our brothers and sisters behind only to lose others when we got home to suicide.
So I mean what I say when I share with you that I know that President Trump understands the grave responsibility that a president and Commander in Chief bears for every single one of our lives. Whether you're a soldier, you're an airman, a Marine, sailor, or a Coastie, he keeps us in his heart in the decisions that he makes.
We saw this through his first term in the presidency when he not only didn't start any new wars, he took action to de-escalate and prevent wars. He exercised the courage that we expect from our Commander in Chief in exhausting all measures of diplomacy, having the courage to meet with adversaries, dictators, allies, and partners alike in the pursuit of peace, seeing war as a last resort.
The truth is, as we head towards our decision as a country in November. The same cannot be said about Kamala Harris. In fact, the opposite is true and we are living through this reality today as this administration has us facing multiple wars on multiple fronts and regions around the world and closer to the brink of nuclear war than we ever have been before.
This is one of the main reasons why I'm committed to doing all that I can to send President Trump back to the White House, where he can once again serve us as our Commander-in-Chief. [cheers and applause]
Because I am confident that his first task will be to do the work, to walk us back from the brink of war. We cannot be prosperous unless we are at peace and we can't live free as long as we have a government that is retaliating against its political opponents and undermining our civil liberties, weaponizing our very institutions against those they deem as a threat.
Kamala Harris has done this over the last three and a half years. She won't hesitate to continue that if she is elected as president.
President Trump has been their first and foremost target in this because they don't want us as voters to even have the option to vote for him.
I've been their most recent target. Added to a secret domestic terror watch list after exposing the truth about what kind of dangers we would face if Kamala Harris is elected as president.
We as Americans must stand together to reject this anti-freedom culture of political retaliation and abuse of power. We can't allow our country to be destroyed by politicians who will put their own power ahead of the interests of the American people, our freedom and our future. [applause]
I am proud to stand here before you today, whether you're a Democrat, a Republican, or an independent, if you love our country as I do, if you cherish peace and freedom as we do, I invite you to join me in doing all that we can to save our country and elect President Donald J. Trump and send him back to the White House to do the tough work of saving our country and serving the people. Thank you very much. [cheers and applause] Thank you very much, Mr. President.
TRUMP: Well, thank you Tulsi. I heard that might happen, but I wasn't sure.
And it happened, because she's really an amazing, really an amazing person. So I look forward to working with Tulsi and everybody. Everybody in this room actually.
And as Tulsi mentioned, early this morning, Tulsi and I were at Arlington National Cemetery with the families of service members who lost their lives in the catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not that we withdrew, but the way they did it.
We were going to do it with dignity and strength. We were in the process of getting out. We would've never given up Bagram, one of the biggest air bases in the world, one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons. We gave it up. We gave it. We gave them everything. China took it over.
China now occupies it. Can you imagine? The longest, most powerful runways, I think eight feet of concrete down, and we gave it all up. Spent billions and billions of dollars years ago building it. One hour away and we're gone. And now China occupies it.
Today marks the three-year anniversary of the terrorist attack at Abbey Gate. Now, we say Abbey Gate, a lot of people don't know what that means. It means Afghanistan that left 13 American service members dead, dozens more badly wounded and many innocent civilians also killed and injured. Hundreds of people killed.
Never been anything like it. It's the wrong base. Shouldn't have taken the soldiers out first. Should have taken the soldiers out last. That's where you'd want to be. They took the soldiers out first and they had a field day at our expense and our reputation. We will never forget those brave warriors who made the supreme sacrifice for our country. They will live in our hearts forever. And to all the gold star families, our gratitude is everlasting, will be everlasting always. We will honor their memory by restoring a government that puts the American people first.
Caused by Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, the humiliation in Afghanistan set off the collapse of American credibility and respect all around the world. And the fake news doesn't want to talk about it. They don't even talk about the three-year anniversary. Terrible word to use, but that's what they're calling it, an anniversary. It's really, I think of anniversary is a little bit different, but it's three years now and the fake news doesn't even talk about it.
Our country will never be safe again until we have fired those responsible for this disaster. Nobody fired. Worst, most embarrassing in my opinion, the most embarrassing day in the history of our country. It gave us Russia going into Ukraine. It gave us the October 7th attack on Israel. Because it gave us lack of respect. We're not respected. We were respected very much four years ago. We're not respected now. The voters are going to fire Kamala and Joe on November 5th, we hope.
And when I take office we'll ask for the resignations of every single official. [cheers and applause] We'll get the resignations of every single senior official who touched the Afghanistan calamity to be on my desk at noon on Inauguration Day.
You know you have to fire people. You have to fire people when they do a bad job. We never fire anybody. You gotta fire them like on The Apprentice. You are fired. You did a lousy job. You did a terrible, terrible disservice to our country. You get fired when that happens. Nobody got fired. Nobody ever gets fired in this administration. It's amazing. All the bad things that have happened. Nobody ever gets fired. The problem is when you fire somebody, they always end up writing a book about you. [laughter] I've had more books written about me. I fire a lot of people when they don't do a good job. I get a book written about me by all these losers that get fired. [laughter]
Every crisis Kamala and Biden have created on the world stage can turn around very quickly and we're going to turn it around. But only we need strong leadership. We need a big victory. November 5th will be the most important day, my opinion in the history of our country. [cheers] Be the most important day. In four short years, thank you, under the Trump administration we built, you know it. You know it better than anybody. Rebuilt the US military.
We obliterated ISIS. So ISIS was going to take five years. ""Sir, I don't know if you're going to be able to do it in five years."" Five years we have those beautiful jets for $150 million apiece and they have knives and rifles. I don't understand why.
I traveled. You know that I traveled to Iraq. Late at night, I got in, I traveled. They said, ""Sir, would you do us a favor? Close your windows. We're turning off the lights. We're getting ready to land in Iraq, at a great base in Iraq."" And I went because I wanted to see why we're not winning against ISIS. We've been fighting them for 20 years. And I was told by my Washington DC generals that it will take five years. ""Five years, sir."" I said, ""I don't get it."" And I went there and I met real generals. And you know the story, you've probably heard the story, but I had one in particular, Raisin Caine. I said, ""Raisin Caine? Your name's Raisin?"" ""Yes, sir. They call me Raisin Caine."" ""What's your first name?"" ""Dan. But they call me Raisin, sir."" ""So your name's Raisin Caine?"" ""Yes."" ""I love you. This is what I'm looking for. I'm looking for Raisin Caine.""
And anyway, we sat down and we had a meeting. He said, ""Would you like to rest?"" ""No, I don't need resting. Unlike other people that we know."" [laughter] We don't need to rest. He'd rest and then leave. There'd be no meeting. I said, ""Let's go now."" I said, ""How do we beat these guys?"" ""Sir, we can do it quickly."" I said, ""No. They say it's going to take a long time. How can you do it?"" ""Four weeks, sir."" "" What?"" ""We can do it in four weeks, sir.""
They didn't use our resources. They wanted to be politically correct. They didn't fly out of areas where they thought the country may be a little angry at us, even though we support those countries and we can do it in four weeks, sir. Well, what are you going to do? We're going to have auxiliary airports—you know—military ports. You know all about them. Sort of portables.
I think he called them, but they're out in the desert all over the place. We want to use them and we'll use here. But they wanted to fly from here, and it's a long distance, sir. By the time we got there, we had to come back. I said, ""So what would you do?"" He said, ""Well, I'd leave from seven places and we'll hit them from the left. We'll hit them from the right. And we'll hit them underneath and on top. We'll hit them so much. They won't know what the hell is happening, sir.""
""And four weeks we'll do it, sir."" ""Four weeks? They said five years."" ""Four weeks is all we need, sir."" And that's what it took. Can you believe it? I said, ""Go ahead."" I made a couple of phone calls first. I said, is this guy serious? Is he serious? He did it. He knocked it out. He knocked it out. So I can tell you about some of those, what a period of time that was. And I tell that story sometimes because I want to just say, we have an unbelievable military when we have the right leader. [applause] We have an unbelievable military.
Really true. And they're not going woke. Maybe a few people on top or woke, but those guys, they'll never be aw woke. They could be put in a room and preached to for the rest of their lives and they won't go woke.
And we know them. I saw them. I saw them. What they did. I saw what they did—what they did with ISIS. We knocked out 100% quickly of the ISIS caliphate because we decided to fight. We have the greatest people in the world. We have the best equipment in the world.
Now, we did give about $85 billion worth of it to Afghanistan. You know that Afghanistan is one of the largest sellers of military equipment in the world? They sell the stuff that we stupidly left there. We left them $85 billion worth of brand new tanks and planes and even goggles. They didn't fight at night. You know why? They couldn't see. Now they can fight at night. It's not even believable how stupid these people were to allow this to happen to our country, and we became a laughing stock all over the world.
And we buried 13 soldiers. They never mentioned the 45 soldiers that just were so badly hurt, obliterated, legs, arms, face. They don't mention. We left Americans behind. We left all of that equipment behind. And if we would've left from Bagram where you have hundreds of acres as opposed to a small little airport in the middle of the city where everybody just came in and it was a mess. You wouldn't have had any of the problems. But you should have again, taken the military out last.
If I asked a five-year-old child, ""What do you think?"" Here's the facts. Give him one minute. ""Would you take the military out first or?"" ""Sir, I'd take the military out last of course."" But our guys didn't do that. But I just—it's embarrassing to even talk about it. And I wasn't there. You had another group there, but it's a very big embarrassment because I love the country. I want our country to be respected. And we lost a lot of respect at that moment.
And it's so easy. It was so easy. Because we were getting out, but we were getting out with strength and dignity. Think of it. 18 months, not one soldier was killed under mine. And I spoke to Abdul. I told Abdul, ""You can't do that. Can't do it. It's going to be bad, Abdul."" [laughter] And he said, ""Your Excellency, but why do you send me a picture of my house?"" ""Oh, did I send that to you? [cheers and applause] I didn't. Did I send you a picture? Did I send you a picture? I don't remember that Abdul.""
But, and honestly, he was fine. 18 months, they were knocking out our soldiers, one by one, especially under Obama, Barack Hussein Obama. They were knocking out our soldiers one by one, snipers. We didn't have one soldier killed, even shot at in 18 months. And then these guys took over and big lack of respect.
But they had a lot of respect for us during that period. Think of that. Isn't that amazing? Not one soldier was shot at, let alone killed. Nobody killed. But I'm proud to be the first president in decades who started no new wars. And the reason I started no new wars is they respected the people in this room. [applause]
It's true. You don't want to have wars. I ended wars. I could have been in a mess like you have right now. You have every place. The whole world is blowing up. And World War III, if something doesn't happen fast. And that's going to be a World War like no others because of nuclear power and other power that's out there. But we had no wars. Very proud of that.
I finished a couple of wars and I got troops out between Turkey. If you take a look, Turkey and Syria, remember we had 5,000 soldiers in between two armies, and I took them out. I said, ""Wait a minute."" I called a couple of generals, I said, ""How do 5,000 soldiers do when you have one army of 400,000 people, another army of 300,000 people, and they're in the middle, can they do well?"" They said, ""It's not going to be good, sir.""
I say, ""Get him the hell out of there. That border's been there for 2,000 years. They've been fighting over it."" The fake news back there. They hit me hard. They said, ""He removed—"" You know what happened? Nothing. They just kept it the way it's been for 2,000 years under different names and saved a lot of lives. Would've been bad.
But I did a lot of that, and I was very good at using a telephone. We didn't have to send soldiers and kill everybody, although we had some of that too. You know that. With Russia. Where they came at us, I can't do that. Came at us again. I said, ""You can't do that."" They came us at us the third time and you know what happened. A lot of people. People don't talk about it, but they know about it. And they learn not to play around with us. They learn that. Because again, we are the best. But we're not going to be the best for long if it keeps going like it is right now.
Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled. I'll get it settled very fast. [applause]
I don't want you guys going over there. I don't want you going over there. And I'm the only candidate in this race who can make this promise. I will prevent—this is for the spouses. I will prevent World War III. Nobody else is going to prevent it. You're going to end up in World War III.
Look at what's going on right now with Ukraine. Their surging into Russia. Okay? You're going to end up in World War III and it's going to be a bad one.
When I'm President, America will be respected again, respected like never before. They were respected four years ago. Viktor Orban from Hungary, Prime Minister, he's known as a very tough leader, tough man, good man, but a tough man, but one of the toughest in Europe. And they asked him a little while ago, why is it that the whole world is blowing up? He says, ""because President Trump isn't the President of the United States. If he were the President of the United States, none of this stuff would be happening right now. None of it. None of it at all."" And I believe that's true. That's true. For that to have happened is crazy.
I'll take immediate action to restore our depleted military. You know we don't have any ammunition again. Do you remember when I first came in?
They said, ""sir,"" right? [Trump points at crowd member] I see that guy. Sounds like you were pretty much involved with trying to fill it up. I like that guy. I don't know who the hell he is. Stand up. Let me see. Stand up. He's like central casting, but that's—come on, stand up right there. That's good. I like that guy. [applause]
It's true, though. True. We had no ammunition. I took over. They came to me, ""sir."" ""How are we doing militarily?"" ""We have a problem, sir."" ""What is it?"" ""We have no ammunition."" That's a lousy thing.
You know, you're running a country, we got enemies, and if you have the smart President, you'll be able to do fine, but you don't want to tell your enemy you have no—I don't want to tell President Xi of China we don't have ammunition. But before that, they came out with a report, before I got there, saying that the United States has no ammunition. I said, ""Who would release a report like this?"" Even if it's true, you don't talk about it, right? We do a lot of reports that are stupid reports, like a report that came out a couple of weeks ago that we would lose in a war with China. You saw that report? We're not going to lose in a war with China.
That we would lose in a war with China, how stupid are these people that would put a report like that? If you feel we're a little weak, you gotta strengthen it up, but you don't do reports that we're going to lose to China in a war. Stupid people do that, like the people that are in office right now. [applause]
I had, and you will say it, I had ammunition. We had so much, it was coming out of our gills, right? I had ammunition I said, ""what the hell do we do with all this ammunition?"" We had so much. And now we don't have ammunition again. We gave it all away to different groups, but mostly into Ukraine, and we don't have ammunition.
We had so many missiles, we didn't know if we could fire them all. We had to hire teams of people. Even the concept, we had so much. Warehouses were full. We took new warehouses and now we're back to a point where we have no ammunition again. These people are just so destructive.
So I always look for good words, highly sophisticated, and I'm highly educated, I like sophisticated words, but there's only one word I can—stupid. They're stupid people. I'd like to say, I guess you could say incompetent sounds maybe a little better. I don't know which is better, being stupid or being incompetent because they're both. [laughter] We have no ammunition again, but we'll get it taken care of.
Boy, oh boy, can you imagine if they wanted to go after us? Can you imagine that? And we're saying they have no ammunition. This was just released a little while ago. We give so much of it away. We never get anything for it either.
Europe, by the way, is much more, and should be much more, concerned, obviously, with the Ukraine situation than us, but we've spent $150 billion more. Why do we spend 150 billion? Why aren't they going to equalize? They should equalize. I told them, I said, ""you gotta equalize it."" They don't like—then I read Barack Obama is much more popular than Donald Trump. Of course he is. He said, ""we'll spend all the money."" I say, ""you gotta pay up.""
And that's what happened. I got NATO to pay up hundreds of billions of dollars, but then now we've lost it again because nobody's—I'll bet you nobody's ever asked Europe to pay up. They don't even ask. I'll bet you that nobody said to Europe, ""we're 150 billion more than you."" They have about the same size economy when you add all of the different nations up as us, and nobody has said to them, ""gotta pay up.""
I did that. I was with NATO. They were way behind. Of the 28 nations, almost all of them were not paid. Other than that, they were doing quite nicely. Thank you. But we had seven that were paid and the rest weren't. And Obama came in, made a speech, Bush came in, made a speech. I came in and said, ""you guys owe us a lot of money"" because we were spending our money.
So think of it. They take advantage of us on trade because they are horrible to us on trade, the European nations. Horrible. They don't take our farm products.
When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in the middle of Germany? Maybe never. I said to Angela, ""Angela, do you have any Chevrolet's or Fords in the middle of Munich?"" ""No, I don't think so."" But we have plenty of Mercedes Benz's and BMW's, Volkswagen's. Millions and millions of cars.
So they get us in the military, then they get us on trade. On top of everything else. It's not a good way. I was straightening it all out. It was getting straightened out very quickly. And very interesting, though, I said, ""who would do this? Who would do this?"" Hundreds of billions of dollars we lose in the defense of Europe. All I say is, ""let's equalize. We'll help you, but you owe us 150 billion.""
And during one meeting, I remember, NATO, one of the heads of countries, I won't embarrass him by saying which one, but we had 28 countries gathered round the table, it was sort of a semi-secret meeting, which nothing secret in this world, but some of the press didn't want to report it because it was a good story. But one of the leaders stood up, said, ""does that mean—"" He wasn't paid. He owed us billions. ""Does that mean if we don't pay you, you're not going to defend us against Russia?"" I said, ""that's what it means. Are you saying you're delinquent?"" I don't know about that word. That's a real estate word. Very simple word. It means you're not paid. ""You're saying you're delinquent."" ""Yes, let's say we're delinquent. Will you defend us?"" I said, "" absolutely not."" I took so much heat from the fake news media.
Now, if I said, ""yes, I will defend you,"" they're not going to pay. What happened is hundreds of billions of dollars came pouring in because I said that. [applause] Hundreds of billions of dollars came pouring in and they have money, but this should not be happening. This should not. This mess that's going on over there now is very dangerous and it shouldn't be happening. I'm the one that got them the money. Literally hundreds of billions of dollars came right in. Guys that were not paying for years.
But other Presidents never even asked them for the money. They'd make a speech and leave. Literally, I was getting ready to make a speech. I said, ""let me see some statements."" I looked at some, I said, ""nobody's paying."" We paid for everybody. We were keeping it solvent.
One of my proudest achievements on my first term was to create Space Force, the first new branch of the armed forces in over 70 years. That's a big deal. Now that Space Force is up and running, I agree with your leadership, you want this very badly, but I agree that the time has come to create a Space National Guard as the primary combat reserve of the US Space Force. [cheers and applause] Very good. Very good. Thank you. Thank you.
So as President, I will sign historic legislation creating a Space National Guard, until I spoke to somebody that's a great guy, very much a fan of yours, Marco Rubio. I said, ""what do you think?"" He said, ""I love this. I love it. I love it."" So we're going to do that.
Space Force has been very important. Very, very important. When I did that, other people came in, they wanted to end it, and they were just hammered because people realized how important—we were getting just destroyed in space. And now we're leading. We are leading with all of the major metrics in space. Russia and China were killing us because we didn't really have a focus on it. And once you did that, we have a focus, and now we're leading in space. Throughout the Armed Forces, we will make a historic investment in building a US military for the 21st century, investing heavily in drones, robotics, artificial intelligence. Hypersonics.
You know hypersonics was us. Somebody stole the stuff and Russia ended up making them, but we're making them now. But Russia ended up making that, super speed missiles. They go about seven times faster than a regular missile, which is quite fast. And uh we're going to build a great Iron Dome for missile defense around our nation. Other countries has it. Israel has it. Ronald Reagan wanted this many years ago, but we didn't have the technology at that point. But now we have the technology, so we're going to do the Great Iron Dome, and it's all going to be built in our country. We're going to build it right here. [cheers and applause]
And as your Commander-in-Chief, I will ensure that the National Guard members have access to train on the same state-of-the-art equipment as active duty forces. We're going to make sure about that. [applause]
And I'll also get you reinforcement for allies abroad, making them pull their weight. They have to do that and they have to pay their fair share, as I was saying. And for years, all of these NATO countries spent far less than 2% of GDP on their militaries, leaving our forces overstretched. We were the ones making up the difference in paying for, to make up for shortfalls and help deter threats.
I'll insist that every NATO nation must spend at least 3%. You have to go up to 3%. 2% is the steal of the century, especially when we're paying for it. You know, we pay for them. It's just not even believable. For most NATO countries, this will represent a defense budget increase of about 30%. And of course, if you take a look at their numbers, their numbers are starting to dwindle because of all the money they're spending in Ukraine.
Starting on day one, I will confront the recruiting, retention, and moral—when you talk about the crisis that you have, you have a morale crisis because I think it's a country crisis. I think morale is about the leader of the country. I really do. I think you can only do so much. They have to be proud of our—their leader. They have to be proud of their country. They have to believe in their country. They have to believe in the American dream, or you're going to have a morale problem. And that's what you have. You have a morale problem. We will get critical race theory and left-wing gender insanity out of the armed forces and totally out of the United States military,—[applause] and we'll take care of our amazing veterans better than anybody.
In my first term, I gave the VA Choice and made it permanent. VA Choice, where you don't have a doctor. You go outside. I mean people were waiting for four months, for five months. You people probably know it. You have friends that know it very well. They go in for something that was not a big deal, and they end up being terminally ill cause they couldn't get to see a doctor, so I created and have VA Choice. They've been wanting to do it for 57 years. I got it done. Passed in Congress.[applause]
And as you know, they now go in, if they can't get rapid service, we call it Rapid Service, then they go to an outside doctor, they get themselves fixed up, and we pay the bill and it's been great. It's been great. But I understand that Biden wants to terminate it. He wants to go back to the old system where you wait for nine months and then you die. It's not even believable. No, they want to terminate it. Now, after this speech, they won't.
Every time I come in and say what really bad things, they end up—like I said, no tax on tips. It caught on like crazy. No tax on tips. This doesn't affect you guys. You're not big for tips, okay? [laughter] You don't need tips. But there are a lot of people that no tax on tips is a big deal. And I said, no tax on tips. I want two, three months. All of a sudden she's making a speech, and they were just the opposite, they were going after tip income, which is pretty hard to go after in all fairness. And she's making a speech. It goes, ""oh, and by the way, no tax on tips."" And it didn't play well for her.
But they do that now on VA Choice. You watch what's going to happen. They'll end up saying, ""oh, we want to keep VA Choice."" But they don't. They're not competent and they don't—but VA Choice has been one of the great and the others, VA Accountability. Do you know what that is? VA Accountability. The veterans had some horrible, horrible people in there. Sadists, bad people. They treated our veterans very badly because they weren't in primetime. In primetime, they wouldn't have talked to them that way, but they weren't in primetime and they were sadists and a lot of other things. Thousands. 9,000 of them. And it was a shocking act of betrayal.
It uh, we had to fire, we fired 9,000 people that were bad and we replaced them with good people. And then Kamala and Biden gutted those reforms after they got in, and they tried to reinstate many of the people that were fired for good reason, because they weren't treating our veterans. They were sadists, in many cases, vicious people. And then they gave them the option to come back or get a massive $200 million buyout. Can you believe this? Of people that treated our veterans badly?
And I had the highest number, 92% approval, from our veterans. That's the highest number by far ever. Now it's in the 40s, and it didn't take long to get there, but we had 92% approval rate from our veterans.
Upon my inauguration, we will take the sadists that Kamala Harris let in and escort them from the VA hospitals and get them the hell out of our federal buildings and away from our great men and women. [applause] Because those who mistreat our veterans will not be protected. They will be terminated. We're going to terminate them. We're going to get them out. Can't believe we have to do it. It's like I have to say it a second time.
Under Kamala Harris, American veterans are treated worse, by far, than illegal aliens. Illegal aliens are treated—you ever see them? They stay in hotels. We have veterans sleeping on the street and inside luxury hotels, you have people that came into our country, many from prisons, many from mental institutions, many terrorists, and they are treated better than our veterans. They don't care about our veterans.
As borders are, Kamala has spent over one billion of taxpayer money to house illegal aliens and foreign migrants in some of the most expensive housing and hotels anywhere in the country. Meanwhile, more than 41,000 homeless American veterans are living in squalor on our streets.
I mean I hope people are going to remember this because it's terrible. What's going on is terrible. You know, we become the Republican—I call it the party of common sense. We want to have strong borders. We want have fair elections. Like it'd be nice if somebody votes and the vote actually counts. Little things like that.
But we gotta have borders. We can't let millions of people come into a country. I called it invasion. I got the wall built by using military funds. I said, ""our country's being invaded,"" and I was able to do—we won 11 lawsuits. Everybody sued me. Crazy Nancy Pelosi sued me. She was always—she's crazy as a bed bug, that one. She's nuts. She's a nut. But at least Joe Biden likes her a lot. No, I don't think so.
Think he's angry? He fights for a year and a half in a primary system. He ends up getting 14 million votes, and they have somebody that didn't get one vote. She was let out sooner than anybody. She never made Iowa the first state. Never made it. She was the first one out of 22 people to quit, and she's now the nominee of the party. I mean, explain this, please.
When I take office, I will sign an executive order to stop every penny that Harris has been spending on the shelter and transport of illegal aliens, and we will redirect that money to provide shelter and treatment for homeless American veterans. [cheers and applause] And we will end very rapidly veterans homelessness in America. We had it down to a level that was the lowest In a long time. We would've had it knocked out, but we were interrupted.
As you know, Kamala's border Invasion has directly impacted thousands of National Guard families. I'll tell you what, African American families, Hispanic American families, their jobs are being taken. Unrelated to you, but their jobs are being taken. What's happening at our border, and she's in charge, and now she said, ""Well, I wasn't really involved too much with the border. I wasn't involved."" And even better now, she's saying, ""Oh, well, we actually had strong borders."" If they say it enough, even though we had probably 20 million people, more than 20 million people, but they figure if you say it over and over again, ""Our borders were strong, our borders were strong."" And these are people, they're not into it. Maybe like us, maybe like me, certainly.
Nobody's into it like me. I had a nice life until I did this. You know that? I had a nice, very beautiful life, but I wouldn't change it. They said, ""Would you have done it again?"" I said, ""Absolutely, because we're going to make America great again."" We already did, and we're going to do it again. [cheers and applause] Thank you.
Last Thanksgiving. I visited the southern border near McAllen, Texas, where patriots of the Texas National Guard were doing the job that Harris refused to do. She refused to do it. In fact, when our guardsmen put up razor wire and boys to stop illegal crossings, Kamala and Joe Biden, Crooked Joe, sued to take those defenses down. You know that, right? How about where they say, ""No, no, we have a strong border."" So bad. But then we find out that they flew almost a million people in over the border. They flew. That stops all of their—I shouldn't say this because if there's a debate, it would be nice to surprise it with that one. They flew. They have to have an answer to everything. ""Well, we decided, look, they flew almost a million people into our country. Our country can't handle it. No country can handle it. Our country's going to go bankrupt. No country can handle it. They're taken over the schools, they're taken over the hospitals, they're taken over everything, and they're getting jobs that were taken by other people that are not too happy.
But think of it, they flew almost a million people over everything because they were saying about how strong the border, but then they say, ""Well, what about the million people you flew?"" They have no answer for that one yet, but they'll come up with one. They always have an answer.
I want to salute every Guard member who has deployed as part of Operation Lone Star to defend America from her migrant invasion, it's what it is. Including those from Texas, Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Idaho, Iowa, Oklahoma, North Dakota, South Dakota, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, or as they say, Missoura[sic]. I love Missoura. I love that state. They do say it that way. Never quite understood that, but I say it that way because I won by 25 points, so I say it that way. [applause] It's true. Utah, Tennessee, Montana, Nebraska, Indiana and New Hampshire, every one of them. [applause] I want to thank them all. Thank them all.[applause]
And do not lose hope because a few months from now, you're once again going to have a commander in chief who defends the sovereign borders of the United States above all else, we have to.
Together we'll stop the human traffickers, which are horrible. They traffic in women, mostly and children, but women, mostly, and because of the internet, it's a big business. It's big business. It's going to be bigger than the drug business, they think. The internet has caused a problem. You think of it almost as an ancient crime. Human trafficking, who would imagine? But because of the internet, it's a big business and we had it down to the smallest number in 42 years, and now they come along and it's going at a level. They stuff women into the back of cars and they stuff them into trunks and bring them around and make a lot of money, and we allow it to happen.
We'll defeat the child smugglers.
We'll crush the cartels, and on day one, I will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country because we have to get the criminals from jails.
They're releasing their prisoners into our country. They're releasing their guard. You gotta see MS-13, the worst gangs in the world, MS-13, they're collecting them and dropping them into the United States. I moved out thousands and thousands of them. They're moving them into the United States. They're coming back. They're taking their drug dealers, their criminals, their murderers.
In Venezuela, crime is down 72% because they've gotten their gang members, they're dropping them all into our country, many countries. And I'm not just talking about South America. All over the world, they're dropping their criminals into our country. They're emptying their jails and they're emptying their prisons into our country. I mean, how stupid can we be? What are we doing?
And we're going to have a crime wave, the likes of which you haven't seen. You see it every day now where a person from such-and-such a country is violent at levels that nobody's ever seen before. You don't have to hear it, but at levels that nobody's ever seen before.
But what it is doing is it's making these countries, and I'm not blaming them, if you can get away with it. I'd be doing it. If I were the president of such-and, I would've done better than them. My prisons would be totally empty. They're emptying their prisons. They're taking their worst people. They're taking their real murderers, drug dealers. They're dropping them. They're taking them and busing them into the United States and dropping them, and they're saying, ""If you come back, we're going to kill you."" And these people aren't worried about being killed. They're tough. This is a tough group of people and we've got them, and nothing good is going to come out of that, and that includes a lot of terrorists.
Your choice in this election is between a president who will always have your back and a radical liberal who will never, ever, ever have your back, whether you like it or not.
In 2020, when the left-wing mobs came from all over to burn our cities to the ground, Kamala stood with the looters and rioters and raised money to bail out violent criminals all over the jails of Minnesota. She came with money to bail them out.
Kamala's running mate, his nickname is Tampon Tim, but I wouldn't say that because this group is a little more low-key than the ones I'm used to speaking before. [laughter] Tampon Tim Walz, he wants—think of this. He signed a bill mandating that every boy's bathroom has tampons in it. I don't think that's good. It's not good.
He ignored the pleas of the mayor and the police chief to deploy the National Guard in Minneapolis and said, ""You're not highly trained soldiers. You're 19-year-olds who cook."" That's what he said, ""You're 19-year-olds who cook."" That's a pretty famous statement.
As president, I stood with the National Guard as you saved Minneapolis, saved Kenosha and saved Washington DC. I saved them. If I didn't override what they wanted to do and what tradition is, those places would've been—we would've lost every monument in Washington.
They came into Washington and they were very rambunctious. They liked to pull the statues down, some of these beautiful statues, and then they hit Abraham Lincoln. I said, ""All right, that's the end of that."" And I found there was a bill from the early 1900s, we don't do bills like that anymore, they said, ""If you touch government property, statues, monuments of any kind, you'll serve 10 years with no probation, no early getting out. You go to jail for 10 years."" Very simple. It was beautifully stated. It was like one paragraph and it had dust on it, it was dusty. Nobody used it because we wouldn't do that because we become very soft. They only go after political opponents. They don't do anything like—murderers, those guys are safe. Drug dealers, no problem. But political opponents they go after. So this was in very bad. It was a very old bill and I had a news conference and they were all over it.
They wanted to take down the Thomas Jefferson, the Jefferson Memorial. They wanted to take it down. They were heading that way. They were actually heading that way. We had them all stopped, but they were heading that way. It's like fighting a war. And I went out to a news conference. They announced, ""Anybody that touches any of our monuments or statues goes to jail for 10 years.""
Everybody left Washington DC. I was very lonely. They all left. I watched them. I watched their asses from the back. [laughter] That's all I could see is thousands of asses. And that stopped. We got it stopped. We got it stopped quickly. They all left immediately, and they haven't come back. Although, the other day you see them starting to do it again. They're taking the spray paint and they're spraying those gorgeous limestone tigers and all the different things. When you spray limestone, you'll see it in 100 years from now because it's a very porous stone, and they were spraying the hell out of it, and they were burning the American flag.
I want to get a law passed. Everyone tells me, ""Oh, sir, it's very hard."" You burn an American flag, you go to jail for one year. Gotta do it. [applause] We gotta do it. They say it's not constitutional. They say, ""Sir, that's not constitutional."" We'll make it constitutional. We're going to make it constitutional, but you burn an American flag, you go to jail for one year. That was terrible, what happened at the convention in Chicago. They're burning American flags all over the place and the fake news doesn't want to show it.
I will proudly stand with you in defense of law and order, and we're going to have four great years in the White House. We're going to make our country very special again. I know your commitment. I know your character in conclusion, and I know your courage. As president, I saw it every year during natural disaster, national emergency, and just a few weeks ago, we saw it in the moments after an evil assassin tried to take my life.
That sucker was moving fast. I say, ""Wow, glad I got down quick, quickly."" But it was uh quite a time. It was quite a thing. Who would think? But that day, a member of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard was in the second row watching as the bullets flew when the shots rang out and hit a great patriot, Cory. We know now Cory by his first name, Cory, the Pennsylvania Guardsman, did not shy away. He did not run for cover. He ran toward the gunshots, took off his tie to use as a tourniquet and cradled Cory's head in his hands, and it was a tough scene. Cory died, as you know. Two other people were hit very badly, were supposed to die, and the doctors up there did a phenomenal job. They're living and they're doing okay, and although he tragically could not revive Cory, he did what every Guardsman here would have done, and it was a tough, it was a tough thing he did, to be honest, I saw that. It was a tough thing he did. Tremendous courage. Not only the bullets, I mean, just the fact he was holding this guy who really got hit.
He really got hit, but he gave his all and he was very proud to do it. America's blessed to have such extraordinary patriots, as are all of the people in this room. You put your service above yourself, and when our country needs you, you always answer the call. I know that very much. I know the people here.
That's the spirit of duty and loyalty that defines the men and women of the National Guard, and it's the spirit that is going to save our country because our country needs saving.
With your support in this election, we will reclaim our sovereignty. We will rebuild our military. We will support our police. We will stop migrant crime, which is at levels that nobody can even imagine. We will restore our economy. We'll get rid of inflation. We will protect our second amendment. We will lift up our cities, we will secure our rights, and we will defend our freedoms like we have never defended our freedoms before and we will fight, fight, fight for America. [cheers and applause]
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
So just in closing, you've never let me down, never. You've always been there for me when we had emergencies, when we had a crisis, and I'm going to always be there for you and I can promise you this, together we will make America great again. Thank you. God bless you all. [cheers and applause] Thank you very much. God bless you all. Thank you. Thank you, man. Thank you.

    [music: in person, Lee Greenwood sings ""God Bless the USA""]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Lee, thank you very much, really, and thank you, a very big thank you to Pennsylvania, we love Pennsylvania. And as I was saying—Oh, I love that chart, I love that graph. Isn't it a beautiful thing? But also beautiful because look at the number, that's the day I left office, it was the lowest border patrol, the lowest it's ever been. Illegal immigration, today it's out of control, but I love it for other reasons too, you know that. So thank you very much and thank Lee, and what Lee has done with that song, and it's such an honor to have it. I want to just let you know that tonight I returned to Butler in the aftermath of tragedy and heartache to deliver a simple message to the people of Pennsylvania and to the people of America.
Our movement to make America great again, stand stronger, prouder, more united, more determined, and nearer to victory than ever before. We're going to make America great again [cheers and applause], going to win the election, going to win the election. And to all Americans, whether you are a Republican, Democrat, Independent, Conservative, or Liberal, or you have no label whatsoever, it makes no difference, our movement, it belongs to you, it belongs to our country, it belongs to our country. And together in just one month, we are going to usher in a new golden age of American security, prosperity, sovereignty, and freedom for our citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. [cheers and applause]
Exactly 12 weeks ago this evening, on this very ground, a cold-blooded assassin aimed to silence me and to silence the greatest movement, MAGA, in the history of our country, MAGA. We love MAGA. For 16 harrowing seconds during the gunfire, time stopped as this vicious monster unleashed pure evil from his sniper's perch, not so far away, but by the hand of Providence and the grace of God, that villain did not succeed in his goal, did not come close. [cheers and applause] He did not stop our movement, he did not break out our spirit. He did not shake our unyielding resolve to save America from evils of poverty, hatred, and destruction. Yet we are here this evening in record numbers, this is a big crowd, this is a big one. [cheers and applause] This is a big one. Not only to mark the triumph of American spirit but over, and you know that, this is really truly in the truest sense, spirit over evil and adversity, but also to pay tribute to some of the best and bravest we have ever known.
This field is now a monument to the valor of our first responders, to the resilience of our fellow citizens, and to the sacrifice of a loving and devoted father, a really great man, you know that. [cheers and applause] Forever afterward—
CROWD: COREY! COREY! COREY!
CROWD MEMBER: WE LOVE YOU!
TRUMP: Forever after, all who have visited this hallowed place will remember what happened here and they will know of the character and courage that so many incredible American Patriots have showed and know, and they know it at a level never seen before probably. First, I want to thank the men and women of the US Secret Service who threw their bodies on top of mine—without even a thought for their own lives. They were on top of me so fast, they were on top of me, and there was not even a moment of doubt in their minds. You watch those tapes, not even a moment of doubt, I want to thank Secret Service, great people, they are great people.
And in that moment, those agents displayed a devotion to duty that cannot be described, and they did it yet again, less than three weeks ago when they really did a fantastic job, another attempt, there was another attempt. We have an evil world; we have a very sick world. My gratitude to them is beyond measure. We also owe a tremendous debt thanks to the Secret Service Counter Sniper and a local police sniper—who returned fire within seconds and stopped the shooter quickly and saved many lives. If he didn't stop, he saved many lives, he had a lot of bullets, a lot of ammunition up there with him. And we are—Just amazing when you think they did it so quickly without any knowledge of what was going on, boom. And had that not happened, it would've been a very different story, it would've been many, many, potentially many, many people.
I also want to express our thanks to the Butler Township Police Department, incredible people. [cheers and applause] The Butler, Sheriff's deputies, Pennsylvania State Police, and all of the other law enforcement heroes, as well as the emergency personnel and doctors, the medical teams at Butler Memorial Hospital, Allegheny General Hospital, who rushed me and rushed some of these very badly wounded people. They were wounded, a lot of badly wounded people, and in particular, two people, two people. And I tell you, they were very brave and great people, they were big Trump fans, and they still are. That means something, that was pretty amazing.
When I got up, I asked whether or not anybody was killed. I assumed that there would be a lot because I heard the bullets winging right over my head. They said probably three, the doctors did such an incredible job. It was one, one great gentleman, but the other two have been amazing actually, they've gone through it, they've gone through a lot. And when the crisis struck, they did really Pennsylvania proud. You've heard that expression, Pennsylvania proud, it's a great place. I went to school, I went to college in Pennsylvania, it's a great place, the people are incredible.
Also, and I have to say, after returning to the field, tonight is one of the really brave Americans who was hit by the assassin's bullet, US Marine Veteran David Dutch. David, thank you. [cheers and applause] Thank you, David. Thank you, David. And David, we're thrilled to see your recovery is going well. Great doctors up here, I have to tell you, great doctors. Your courage is really an inspiration to us, so I want to thank you very much, David. Great gentleman, great, great gentleman. I want to send our love to someone who could not be here because he has just undergone a major surgery related to the shooting, a man who was really badly wounded like David, James Copenhaver.
Because James was a wonderful man, a big Trump fan, [applause] and Mr. Copenhaver is out there watching us right now, but he's in a hospital where they did some additional work, but he's in great shape. He wanted to be here so badly, but he's in great shape and we appreciate it and we're looking to his full and complete recovery, he will have a complete recovery. Thank you. Thank you very much. And of course, there's one more hero who could not make it back here tonight because he is no longer with us, right? You know who that is, right? Corey [Comperatore], our beautiful Corey. Corey is not with us tonight, and he should be, and we all miss him, he's become somewhat of a folk hero. I have to tell you who is with us, is his beautiful wife, and daughters, and relatives, sister. [cheers and applause] Please, where are you? Where are they sitting? [pointing to crowd] There they are. There's just a lot of people, it's not easy to find people in this audience. Goes back further than you can see. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Great family, great incredible family, and he loved you a lot. And you know his wife said something very beautiful. The public, a lot of people, all of us, a lot of people have been very generous, and she said, ""I'd rather have my husband."" That's a good thing to say, that's a good thing to say. ""I'd rather have my husband.""
Corey Comperatore was a [sic] incredible husband and father, a devout Christian, a veteran, and a proud former fire chief. Very respected within the town, everybody knew him. Few men volunteered to run into fires, but Corey was one of those who did, he ran into fires. I spoke to people that were with—This guy would do anything. He was brave, right? Brave guy like you, and he was also a protector who put his life on the line for others and he loved doing it. And when the sound of gunshots pierced the air on that July evening, Corey leapt into the fire one more time. In his last seconds of this earth, he threw himself on the top of his wife and daughters, he didn't want them hurt. He threw himself; he knew what was happening, he didn't want them hurt, and he was hit hard, he was hit hard, and he gave his life to shield their lives. [applause]
Every father and husband in America hopes that if the time came, we would have what Corey had, tremendous courage, tremendous guts, and he wanted to protect his family, and he did protect his family. At this time, it is 6:11, 12 weeks to the minute that the shooting began. I would like to ask everyone to join me in a moment of silence.
[church bells ringing four times] [music: in person, Christopher Macchio singing ""Ave Maria"" by Franz Schubert]
TRUMP: Wow. Now that is what you call a voice. One of the greatest opera singers in the world, and Christopher Macchio, who's truly a great talent, is going to be back when I leave and I'm going to stay backstage watching every song he's going to sing, three or four great songs, ""Nessun Dorma"" and others. And so I wouldn't leave your seat too fast when we're finished today, but this is in honor of three great people, actually three great and in particular, Corey, and we appreciate it. But that is a real voice, isn't it, huh? That's not—what do you think, Mr. future Vice President, pretty good, right? I don't know if you could do that JD, I don't know. I don't think JD can do that.
In the face of murderous hate, Corey answered, the most selfless kind of love. We are joined this evening by Corey's incredible widow, Helen, his two precious daughters, Kaylee and Allyson. And his sisters, Kelly and Dawn, thank you so much. Thank you so much, this is an incredible tribute. [cheers and applause] This is a tribute like no other, and he deserves it. To Helen and the entire family, I can only begin to imagine the depths of your grief, but I want you to know that just like you, we will carry his memory in our hearts for as long as we live.
Everybody in this stadium and everybody that was there on that tragic evening, we are thinking about Corey, we think about him a lot, and I know he's looking down on us right now from heaven smiling at his beloved wife and daughters, and his mother, Karen, and his entire family, his entire family. [cheers and applause] And—he's with you and he's going to be with us for a long time because some people just don't die in vain, and what he's left behind is incredible, and so God bless you, Corey, God bless you, thank you very much, god bless you. [cheers and applause]
Just one little story. Helen told me that on the day that they came to the rally, Corey was really excited because somebody gave them great seats right up front here with the people from North Carolina, the ladies from North Carolina. This is their 227th rally, I don't know what's going on with them, [cheers and applause] those beautiful ladies, but they always seem to have good seats. But Corey had the best seat in the house, and he was telling his wife and family on the way over in the car, he said, ""I'm telling you; he's going to invite me up on the stage."" Because I do that sometimes, I take people, we invite them up in the stage.
And she smiled thinking it'll never happen. And little did anyone realize that Corey would be on the stage three months later in an almost immortal position, and that's where he is today. He's on the stage in a, I think in not almost, I think it's a truly immortal position. So, the love that he showed on that day and throughout his life is the love that sustains the entire movement. The love that our families have, and it's love of our communities and love of our country, it's a force more powerful than any hatred and malice because even in the darkest hours it shines forth as a guide and it guides us like nothing could ever guide us. It guides us really like a candle in the night. And so it's love like Corey's that is joining us to save our country, that's going to heal our country, and that is going to reunite our country as one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. [cheers and applause]
So, what our opponents have never understood is that this movement has never been about me, it's always been about you, it's been about a lot of people, millions and millions of people, the biggest ever in the history of this country maybe anywhere. And everyday people who are the heart and soul of our country, they love our movement, they love our country, and they know they're doing right. Your hopes are my hopes, your dreams are my dreams, and your future is what I am fighting for every single day. [cheers and applause] And now I have a great companion in JD Vance, how good was he the other night? [cheers and applause] How good? He was great.
CROWD: JD! JD! JD!
TRUMP: He was great. But from the very beginning of this journey, I've been on a mission to rescue our country from a failed and very corrupt political establishment, very corrupt. We have to change it; we have to change it. We need also a very free and open press and to give it back to the country you believe in, and I believe in, it's a country that we were born in and the country that you deserve, you deserve this.
And that mission, I will never quit, I will never bend, I will never break, I will never yield, not even in the face of death itself. And I believe that every citizen deserves an America with a very, very grand ambition, great opportunities, and limitless, we just want limitless potential. We want an America where you can get ahead and be proud of life and provide for your family in a really decent way, where we don't have crime, we have a fabulous military to protect us from evil. Everything has to be the best; we have to have the best schools. We have to have strong borders; we don't want bad people coming in and hurting us. We don't want to have—we don't want to have open borders, do we?
You deserve a government that protects and respects its own citizens, that defends your sovereignty, your security, and your dignity and your freedom. You deserve a nation that builds things again, makes things better, that aims for the stars once more, and that once again commands respect. And we want to get respect like we had it four years ago, the entire world respected us, they respected us. They respected us more than they've ever respected us, and now they laugh at us.
We can't have them laugh at us, can we? Above all, you deserve leadership in Washington that does not answer to the lobbyists, to the bureaucrats, or to the corrupt special interest, but answers only to you, the hardworking citizens of America, which there are a lot of them, we have a lot of them. We have a lot of them. Over the past eight years, those who want to stop us from achieving this future have slandered me, impeached me, indicted me, tried to throw me off the ballot, and who knows, maybe even tried to kill me, but I've never stopped fighting for you, and I never will, never will. Never going to stop. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you. And in turn, you have always stood with me. You have always stood with me. No matter what, you saw what was going on, you saw the hoaxes and the scams, you saw everything that went on. We are a team, we're a great team, I think. We're probably the best team ever in the history of our country if you really think about it. We fought together, we have endured together, we have pushed onward together, and right here in Pennsylvania, we have bled together, we bled. We've had three people that really got hit hard, two of them made it, great doctors, great doctors. They weren't supposed to make it, I wasn't supposed to make it. People said –
My great doctor at Butler said, ""Sir, you're the luckiest man alive. This would be a good time for you to go out and buy a lottery ticket. I've never seen anything like—"" I almost went out and bought a lottery ticket, I'll take it. And 31 days from now here in this great commonwealth and all across our land, we are going to win together, we are going to vote together, we're going to win the greatest election in the history of our country, maybe the greatest election all time. [cheers and applause] After we all have been through all of this together, we have—nobody's gone through what we've gone through, nobody. Because I go through it, you're going through it too, but there's never been anything like this. I always say there's an enemy from within and there's an outside enemy, and if you're smart, the outside enemy is not gonna be a problem. Russia, China, and North Korea, we're not going to have a problem if you have a smart president. If you have not such a smart president, then it's a problem, but we have an enemy from within, which I think is much more dangerous than the outside enemy.
We stand on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of our country, we can make these the four greatest years. We'll turn it around so fast that your head will spin. [cheers and applause] With victory on November 5th, we are going to redeem America's promise and unlock the extraordinary future that is just within our reach, it is now within our reach. Think of it one month from today, one month. We got to get there; we got to get there. They'll drop all sorts of bombs, they'll be hitting you JD, they'll be hitting me. These people, they'll hit and hit, but I think we've almost become immune to it, haven't we? We've become immune to it, you got a little dose of it, couple of little doses. No, that's, that's the only way they can even think about winning with open borders.
Who wants open borders? Who wants men playing in women's sports? Who wants sex change operations [booing] for illegal aliens in holding bins? No, I don't think so. We will begin a new era of soaring income, skyrocketing wealth, millions and millions of new jobs, and a booming middle class. We are gonna boom like we've never boomed before, and we're going to unleash a manufacturing renaissance right here in Pennsylvania, including fracking like we've never fracked before. [cheers and applause] We're going to frack, frack, frack. Our opponent said, ""There'll be no fracking, no fracking, we'll never frack, we'll never frack."" Then about when she started seeing poll numbers, by the way. And by the way, speaking of poll numbers, do you mind if I mentioned poll numbers? Because I only mentioned them when they're good. I'd never mentioned it. But one that's hit me really amazingly, Rasmussen, very highly respected poll. JD, it just came out. I don't think you heard this one, but this is a shocker. They always say the Democrats will win the Hispanic vote, but we've been creeping up rather rapidly. [cheers and applause] And Rasmussen is one of the most respected polls. I mean, Republicans would get 4, 5, 6, 9, 10%. They just came out with a poll, 62% for Trump. [cheers and applause] Think of that. Think of that.
And 34% for Kamala. I don't usually use her last name. Nobody knows who I'm talking about. I go, ""Harris, Harris."" They say, ""Who's Harris?"" It's happening all the time. Who's Harris? And we can't find out who she is because if we do, our country is gonna be in big trouble. We will live in a very beautiful city or town that are safe and clean with borders that are sealed and secure.
And again, we want people to come into our country. We all want that. We need that. But you know what? We want it to come in legally. They're going to come in legally and love for our country. [cheers and applause] And America will once again be strong, and confident, and free. We're going to have that. We're going to have it strong, confident, and free. That's why I'm here today. I could right now be having a beautiful life. I don't have to be here. Instead, I could be on a gorgeous beach someplace. I have such nice property.
I could be, I could be in Monte Carlo as an example, but I'd rather be in Butler with you. [cheers and applause] I would rather. I'd rather be in Butler. And I think JD would rather be in Butler. JD?
CROWD: WE LOVE YOU! WE LOVE YOU! WE LOVE YOU!
TRUMP: No, I'd rather be here because we're doing something. They get a lot of rich guys that go, ""Nobody cares about him.""
CROWD MEMBER: We love you!
TRUMP: I had one about a month ago, very, very rich guy, and he called me up. He said, ""President—"" I've known him for a long time. I don't say how long because I don't want my wife to hear that number. It's a long time. But he's very successful. And he said to me, ""Sir, could you do me a favor?"" Guy's worth billions of dollars. He said, ""Could you do me a favor? I can't get into a restaurant. Do you think you could call them to get me in?"" And I said, ""What the hell is the good of being rich if you can't get into a restaurant?""
And I called the maître d', ""Hi,"" I'm a little embarrassed, ""Hi, this is Trump."" ""I recognize your voice."" I said, ""Would you do me a favor? A friend of mine is online about a mile back. This is a very successful restaurant. And he's got his wife."" I describe the wife. ""Could you possibly go get them? Could you go get them and bring them in?"" And he did. And my friend called me up the next day. He said, ""Thank you very much. Thank you.""
CROWD: [inaudible]
TRUMP: Oh. Doctor, please? Doctor, in the house? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, doctor.
Take your time, doctor please. We got plenty of time, right?
CROWD: Yeah!
TRUMP: We got a lot of time.
CROWD MEMBER: We love you.
CROWD MEMBER: We love you, Donald.
TRUMP: You're doing okay? –Take your time.
CROWD MEMBER: We love everybody.
TRUMP: We've got to protect our people, right? Take your time. [cheers and applause]
It's all right, doctor. Go ahead. That's all right. That's all right. People come out two, three days ago and then they get—It's an amazing thing. It's an amazing thing. We appreciate—Everybody appreciates it. Yep. Take your time. That's great. That's great.
Do we have the greatest people in the world? We have the greatest people in the world.
First responders, thank you very much.
CROWD: [singing Francis Scott Key's ""The Star-Spangled Banner""]
O say can you, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming.
And the rocket's red glare, the bomb bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there,
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
[chanting] USA! USA! USA!
VOTE FOR TRUMP! VOTE FOR TRUMP! VOTE FOR TRUMP!
TRUMP: Thank you.
CROWD: VOTE FOR TRUMP! VOTE FOR TRUMP! VOTE FOR TRUMP!
CROWD MEMBER: Four more years!
CROWD MEMBER: We love you, Donald!
CROWD MEMBER: We love you, Trump!
[cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Thank you, doctor. Great job. Thank you very much. Thank you all. Fellas, thank you. First responders, thank you very much. [cheers and applause]
CROWD MEMBER: Thank you!
TRUMP: People are here for a long time, and we appreciate it very much. And so sometimes that happens. A lot of times that happens actually. But you'll be great, you watch. So, 12 weeks ago, we all took a bullet for America and all we are all asking is that everyone goes out and votes. We got to win. We can't let this happen to our country. We can't take another four years like this. We won't have a country left. We're not gonna have a country left. And all of this will be for nothing if you don't get out and vote. It will all be for nothing. We will have talked about it but –and if we do it'll be the greatest achievement, I think in the history of politics for all of us for this age because we're going to change our country around and fast.
We're gonna do things that nobody thought were possible. We're gonna do them fast. So Pennsylvania's time to stand up for America and time to save our country. This is really about saving our country. It's never been like this. When you look at the crime, look at the crime, look at the people that are coming in. Murderers. 13,099 murderers let in over the last short period of time.
Murderers that have been released from penitentiaries, prisons, jails, released into our country. Crime rates all over the world are down. They're taking their gang members and their criminals. They're taking their people in jail and they're releasing them into our country. We can't have it. You know, we just can't have it. How do you get more simple than that? They're releasing murderers. They're releasing drug dealers. They're releasing gang members and criminals. Human traffickers. Mostly they traffic in women and they're releasing them all into our country, and they're emptying their jails. And their crime rates in Venezuela are way down because you know—But it's not only in South America, it's all over the world. And Africa, the Congo.
A lot of people coming out of the Congo in Africa. They're coming out from Asia. They're coming out from the Middle East, Yemen. They're coming out from Yemen. A lot of people coming out of Yemen, and they're known terrorists, and they just release them into our country from countries unknown also. They know nothing about the people. They'll go right in. These people are crazy. And we have to win. We'll stop it immediately and we'll have to—Look, it will be a big deportation.
We're going to deport these people. We're going to get them out of our country immediately. Or we won't have a country. And if we win Pennsylvania, we will win the whole thing. The whole thing will be won. So for the sake of our families, for the sake of our children, we will keep on going. And as the expression goes, I mean, I'm a little embarrassed to say it, to be honest you, but I'm going to say it because a lot of people do say it, we will fight, fight, fight.
CROWD: FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
TRUMP: Going to fight for our country. We're going to fight for our country.
And together we will save this country. We will restore the republic and America's future will be bigger, better, bolder, brighter, happier, stronger, freer and greater and more united than ever before. Our country will be united. You'll watch, you'll watch. We had the most successful country ever, maybe in the world during my term. We are the greatest economy that we've ever had. And you know what was happening? We were uniting the other side, radical left. People were coming over. They wanted to meet. They were coming over. Women, men. If you look at population, our black population, our Hispanic population, our Asian population, everybody was doing better.
People that went to the best schools and best colleges in the world got the highest marks. And people that couldn't get a high school degree, everybody was doing better. And our country was coming together. And then we got hit with COVID, a gift from China. Some people would call it the China virus. And we did a great job on that too. We did a great job. But the world was disturbed.
$60 trillion in damage worldwide. Millions and millions, tens of millions of people killed, and we still during this four-year period, we had the greatest economy. One of the great countries of the world. And we left with the stock market that was higher than it was just prior to COVID coming in. So what we did was something really incredible. But we had the greatest, most successful country ever. We had the greatest economy in our history and we're going to do it again. And maybe even better. We learned a lot. We learned a lot about people and about doing things, and what works, and what doesn't work. And we're going to do it. And it's going to be quick. It's going to be quick.
And we're going to have safe cities, and we're going to have great cities again. And we're going to have a capital in Washington, DC which is right now crime-ridden. You leave from the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; you go drive down to Washington DC and you drive down, and you end up getting murdered. You end up getting hurt, you get mugged. We are going to straighten out Washington DC. We're going to make it again, the most beautiful capital in the world.
We're not going to have graffiti. We're not going to have graffiti on our marble columns. We're not going to have roads that have potholes all over them and medians that are falling into the highways. We're going to run it properly. We're going to change it. We're going to run it properly. It's an embarrassment to us. Can you imagine foreign leaders coming in and running over roads that haven't been paved in years? We're honored to be joined tonight by one of the people who is going to help us build this incredible future. And he is a truly incredible guy. And I don't say that that often. [cheers and applause]
He's a great gentleman. He's done such an unbelievable job for North Carolina, for Georgia, for Alabama, for Florida, for Tennessee. His name is Elon Musk. [cheers and applause] He saved free speech. He created so many different great things. Where is he? Come on up here, Elon. He created the first major American car company in generations. And his rocket company is the only reason we can now send American astronauts into space. Come here. Take over, Elon. Yes, take over.
ELON MUSK: Hi, everyone. [cheers and applause] As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm dark MAGA. Well, first of all, I want to say what an honor it is to be here. And you know, the true test of someone's character is how they behave under fire. We had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs and another who was fist pumping after getting shot. Fight, fight, fight. [cheers and applause] Blood coming down the face.
CROWD: FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
MUSK: Now America is the home of the brave. [cheers and applause] And there's no truer test than courage under fire. So who do you want representing America?
CROWD: TRUMP!
MUSK: Yeah, absolutely. And I think this election, I think it's the most important election of our lifetime. This is no ordinary election. The other side wants to take away your freedom of speech. They want to take away your right to bear arms. They want to take away your right to vote effectively. You got 14 states now that don't require voter ID. California, where I used to live, has just passed the law, banning voter ID for voting. [booing] I still can't believe that's real. So how you supposed to have a good proper election, if there's no ID. It's just meaningless. And free speech, free speech is the bedrock of democracy. And if people don't know what's going on, if they don't know the truth, how can you make an informed vote? You must have free speech in order to have democracy. That's why it's the First Amendment. And the Second Amendment is there to ensure that we have the First Amendment. [cheers and applause] President Trump must win to preserve the constitution. He must win to preserve democracy in America.
CROWD: WE WANT TRUMP! WE WANT TRUMP! WE WANT TRUMP!
MUSK: Yes. This is a must-win situation, must win. So I have one ask for everyone in the audience, everyone who watches this video, everyone in the live stream, there's one request. It's very important. Register to vote. Okay? And get everyone you know, and everyone you don't know, you drag them to register to vote. There's only two days left to register to vote in Georgia and Arizona. 48 hours. Like, text people now, now. And then make sure they actually do vote.
If they don't, this will be the last election. That's my prediction. Nothing is more important. Nothing is more important. So get everyone you know. So I'm speaking to people out there. Everyone in the crowd I think is already convinced. But for people out there that are watching the video, watching the live stream, you need to get everyone you know at work, your friends, family, text groups, your social media, everything, get them to register to vote right now. Only two days left for Georgia and Arizona. Only a couple of weeks left in Pennsylvania. And if they're not registered to vote, it doesn't matter at that point. Register to vote. I'm being repetitive for a reason. So nothing is more important. And a lot of people think maybe their vote doesn't count. Well, it does. Okay? It does. It matters. And this election could be decided by a thousand votes, 500 votes, a tiny margin. So get everyone you know to register to vote. I believe it's swampthevote.com. I believe that's the site. Double check that your registration is good. Don't take it for granted.
I'm just being repetitive about this point because it is the one takeaway more than anything that will matter is getting those registrations and then getting everyone you know to actually vote. That is what will decide this election, especially in Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] So thank you. And honestly, you want to just be a pest. Just be a pest to everyone you know. People on the street, everywhere. Vote, vote, vote. Fight, fight, fight. Vote, vote, vote. Thank you. [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: What a great guy. And he'd rather be making rocket ships because he'd really rather do that. Nobody better. I think he's got 90% of the rockets that go up. But Elon, thank you very much. Incredible, incredible. What he says is true. [cheers and applause] What he says is true. We're all having fun here tonight. But if we don't register and if we don't vote, we're just going to look upon this as another sort of nice day in our life. But it won't even be a nice day. We're going to look back and we're going to say, ""Wow, it's a lot of time, a lot of effort. We got to win."" If we don't win, it's as he said, it's just not important. We have to save our country. So you have to get out and vote. You got to get out and vote. You got to get your friends and vote because they play a lot of tricks this particular other side.
Elon is a very nice guy. He doesn't want to say it, but they play a lot of tricks. We can't let it happen. We can't let it happen again. We can't let it happen. And one thing, they showed us how bad they are, they showed us how bad a job they do. So that's one thing we got from this four years. They've done the worst job. It's the worst president in the history of our country. It's the worst vice president in the history of our country. And if you watched over the last couple of days, they are doing—This is a Katrina for them.
This is one of the worst. They say it's the worst job ever done on helping people through the ravages of a hurricane. And they're watching—She's out there, out there campaigning in San Francisco, a place that she ruined. Okay? She ruined. She ruined San Francisco. She ruined—Think of this. She ruined San Francisco. She was the worst DA. And she ruined the state of California, and now she wants to ruin the United States of America. We can't let her do it.
So, I called Elon to tell him that they needed Starlink as an example. They couldn't get Starlink. I didn't know what Starlink was. I must tell you. Elon, I'm so embarrassed. I didn't know what the hell Starlink was. He loves Starlink. He can tell you every little screw that's needed, every wire. Me, I didn't know. But when I was in North Carolina and Georgia just the other day, yesterday to be exact, but they were saying, we have tremendous communications especially in North Carolina. And we have tremendous problems. We have no communication. The poles were ripped down, the wires were underwater, houses were destroyed.
Possibly a thousand people. Maybe more will be. There's 600 people missing. Missing is not good. Because you know what missing means generally. That's really bad. And they had no communication. They had literally no communication with, they called it the mainland because the water was so crazy. It was like they were in the middle of a lake, and they'd never seen anything like it. And they said, ""Do you know somebody named Elon Musk?"" I said, ""Yeah, I happened to know him a little bit. He just endorsed me actually.""
Well, he endorsed me a long time ago, but he still—To me, every day is a good endorsement from Elon. Nobody is smarter than Elon. And they said, ""Could you do us a favor? Could you help us? We're trying to get Starlink and it's very hard to get. Most people say you can't even get it."" I called up Elon. I said, ""North Carolina is in big trouble. Georgia is in big trouble. They need communication."" They have none because their poles have been knocked down and their wires are underwater and even dangerous. dangerously underwater. But they have no communication. Elon, could you do something about Starlink? Whatever the hell that is, Elon. Whatever, Starlink. That's all they want to hear is Starlink.
And an amazing thing happened. I got a call from one of the top people in North Carolina. I got a call from another great person in Georgia. And I wasn't finished with my phone call yet, and they got word that Starlink would be delivered to the States. I said—No. And I said, ""What the hell is he—What kind of a system is that? Normally you'd have to hang up and he'd go and call people."" He did it during the phone call. What kind of a system do you have? That's why he's a very advanced, he is a very advanced person, but I want to thank you, Elon because I got it. And I said, ""How does it work? Two days later, how does it work?"" They said, ""Much better than the wires.""
So now I'm saying, ""Why the hell aren't they—You're going to come out very well anyway."" And he also said, ""You don't have to pay me. You pay someday when you get the money back. You don't have to pay me."" He wanted nothing. He's a great guy. Thank you, Elon, for being here. [cheers and applause] Thank you very much. Great honor, great honor.
CROWD: ELON! ELON! ELON!
TRUMP: Thank you, Elon. And that's heartfelt. I can't even see the end. That's a lot of people here today. We're also joined by a great gentleman, a top, top, brilliant student. He went to a tremendous college, and he graduated right at the top of his class in two years. I didn't know you could do, that's four-year college. Then he went to the military then he came out and he did fantastically inside the military. Then he came out, he went to Yale without the benefit of family ties. You know what that means? Right? That's pretty good without family ties. I don't know too many of those people. They had no family ties. He got in. He can't get in, and he graduated along with his wife. They're not going to have any problems with your kids academically. I can tell you.
His wife and him were like the top students in the class. But he went to Yale Law School and then he went out into the private sector, did great. Then he ran for the senate, and he did fantastically. He won. And he's like a rocket ship. He's like one of Elon's rocket ships the way his career is going. But you see why? Because he's a really brilliant guy. And you saw that the other night in the debate. Right? You saw that the other night in the debate. [cheers and applause] You know the expression they have? If that were a fight, they would've stopped it. Right?
So, I just want to thank JD. I was always confident in that pick. And we had great people too, JD. Every—Every one of those guys were great. Every one of them would have done a great job. It was amazing. But we appreciate the job you're doing. He's also very energetic, and he'll go on anywhere. He'll go on MSDNC [sic]. I say, ""Oh, he's done that."" He'll go on CNN. He has no problem. He swats them like this. He has no problem. No, it's true. Other people say, ""Sir, I'd rather not do that one. I'd rather not do that one, sir. I'd rather not do them,"" because they are very—With him, he doesn't care. He says, ""They're not going to outsmart me."" So, I want to thank JD. You've done a great job. Thank you very much. Amazing. Great.
CROWD: JD! JD! JD!
TRUMP: We have a lot of senators and a lot of people from Congress. I'm going to introduce a few of them that are really outstanding, and they are warriors and they're great Patriots. Senator Eric Schmitt. Where's Eric Schmitt? He's around here someplace. Nice, tall, handsome guy. Thank you, Eric. What a great job you've done. He helps us so much with the Senate, and we've got a great Senate. We have to get a couple of more senators elected. I think it's going to happen, too. I think it's going to happen.
We have members of Congress here, Dan Meuser. Dan? Where's Dan? Great, great job. Real warrior. These are warriors. Guy Reschenthaler. That's the hardest name in the Senate to pronounce, but I've learned how to pronounce it. Guy, thank you very much. Great. Where's Guy? Guy? Thank you very much, Guy? Glenn G.T. Thompson. Fantastic guy. Thanks, Glenn. Great job. John Joyce. Thank you, John. Great. Cory Mills. He's out there fighting, too. [cheers and applause] He's out there. He is out there in North Carolina, Georgia. He's out there helping people.
Mike Waltz, who's a tremendous national security asset. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Mike. Thank you, Mike. Okay. And a man who was my doctor, I got to know him as a doctor in the White House, right. And then before that, he was actually an Admiral. And then he went to the White House. He was a great Admiral. He was a great doctor, and I love him for one reason. They asked him in the White House. The press, the fake news media said, ""Who is the most—"" He was the doctor for Obama, Bush, and Trump. That's pretty good, right? White House doctor for the three of us.
He said, the press, ""Who is the healthiest of the three?"" He said, ""Definitely, it's Donald Trump. There's not even a contest."" And I love that guy. JD, when he said that, I said, ""I like this guy."" So then he said, ""You know, sir?"" He was leaving the White House. He said, ""You know, I'd love to run for Congress."" He ran against 28 people. They were all running for the Republican primary because whoever won that primary is going to win. I think it's a Trump plus 48. Whoever wins gets 48-point start.
And not only did he win, he won easily, and now he's one of the most popular people in Congress and one of the most talented, maybe more importantly. Ronny Jackson. [cheers and applause] Ronny? Where is Ronny? Where is you? Oh, good. Thank you, Ronny. You got a lot of talent surrounding you there. I think it's very important, also. We're here for a reason, and that's to win and to honor Corey, but Corey wants us to win, too.
There's a man in the audience that's been very much a career path a little bit like JD, great student, great, talented student, and fantastic in the military, then went out to be a tremendous success, one of the most successful people on Wall Street, actually. And he's tough, and he's smart. He's going to make sure you always have fracking in Pennsylvania, and he's going to make sure you have many other things other than fracking.
You have a senator that now does nothing. He does nothing, and he doesn't fight for you. He votes with Biden, if you can believe it, 100% of the time. But this guy, we're lucky that he does it. I don't know. He might not have done it if he had it to do again. I don't know. But I think he's just one of the most outstanding people anywhere in the country to run for office, and we're lucky that he's doing it. And he's got a real shot. He's doing very well in the polls.
It's hard to beat somebody that's been there a long time, but this is somebody that's been there a long time and did nothing. He did nothing. His name is David McCormick, and he's great and I hope he's going to be your next senator. [cheers and applause] I see somebody else. I didn't know he was here. Mike Kelly. I see Mike Kelly here. [cheers and applause] Stand up. Oh, boy, am I lucky. Am I lucky I spotted him. If I didn't spot you, Mike, I was in big trouble, right? This is a man who's beloved in this state, and he's fantastic. So thank you, Mike. Thank you.
We also have some terrific people from law enforcement, Butler County Sheriff Mike Slupe. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Mike. Great job. Thank you. Thank you, Mike. Thank you for your help, too. I could tell you. Thank you for your help. I can say that. Thank you very much. Butler County Commissioner Leslie Osche. Leslie, thank you. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Leslie. Great job. RNC Chairman Michael Whatley, this guy is doing a great job. [cheers and applause] He's doing great. Came from North Carolina. We won North Carolina.
He kept their cheating down to a minimum, and we were able to win it. We were solid all night long. He's great, but if we don't have good results by the 6th of November, I will never say that about him again. [laughing] No, he's a great guy. He's working very hard. 24 hours a day, he's working. I know that. He's working mostly on Stop the Steal because we have a lot of votes. We have plenty of votes. Stop the Steal. That's why you've got to get out. You've got to get out and vote. We're going to win this thing.
The more we win it, it's too big to rig, the expression we use. Make it too big to rig. Elon would understand this better than anybody. Statistically, at a certain point, their cheating doesn't matter. We want to make it too big to rig. We also have somebody that's very special, the co-chair of the Republican Party, Lara Trump. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Lara, thanks.
And you know, oftentimes with families, they say, ""Oh, why did you put that one in or this one in?"" And all the different people, so many people have problems with that. In her case, everyone said, ""How the hell did you get her to do it? She has been unbelievable."" So, thank you very much. Comes from North Carolina, and I have a feeling she's going to be spending some time down there a little bit. And she's married to my wonderful son, Eric, who's right here. So, Eric, please stand up. [cheers and applause] He's a great guy.
Eric has a distinction. He has gotten more subpoenas than any man in the history of our country by about 10 times. Every day Congress would meet, they'd send him a subpoena. What is it about? They have no idea. But I think he's got the all-time record, and he's handled it all beautifully. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. A friend of mine, a great, great businessman, one of the most respected people, and he made a big, big contribution yesterday to Georgia and a big contribution to North Carolina. Steve Witkoff is here. [cheers and applause] Hi, Steve. Thanks.
And another man who's one of the greatest businessmen in the country, he actually said that ""If Trump doesn't win, this country is going to go into a massive depression."" Well, I don't know about that, but he has been a very good predictor, I will say that, and truly one of the greats, one of the great pickers, picker meaning stocks. He knows what he's doing and highly respected by everybody. John Paulson. Thank you, John. [cheers and applause] Great. Great guy.
Now, we have so many others, and I won't do it because we have to really get out of here before it gets too cold for people, but I just—I love it much better because there's one teleprompter, not that I use the teleprompters too much. Isn't it nice to have a president that doesn't need a teleprompter? [cheers and applause] No, we don't need it. We don't need it. But this one was right smack in the sun. Great job back there, fellas. They said, ""The teleprompters are working fine."" Well, thank goodness.
Did you see what happened the other day with the teleprompter with her [Kamala Harris]? That was not a pretty sight. The teleprompter went off, and she went off, too. She didn't know what the hell happened. And you know, teleprompters are very dangerous because they go off a lot. You have to be prepared for them to go off, cold blank. You'll have 100,000 people. You have 75,000 people. You have this. If the teleprompter goes off, you got to be able to move. She did not move well. This was not a good situation.
But three more heroes from July 13 who rendered first aid to Corey incredibly, Dr. Jim Sweetland, Rico Elmore, who was unbelievable. [cheers and applause] Rico, you were unbelievable. He ran over National Guard. He ran over and grabbed Corey, and Corey was still living. He was doing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a man who was really in bad shape like nobody's ever seen. His family appreciates it, and I do, too. So thank you, Rico, very much. Right? Amazing, amazing.
Amazing the people that we have. You learn about them under times like this. That's when you really learn. So we're going to be seeing Rico again. Ed Shear, fantastic job. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Ed. We appreciate it. Thank you, Ed. Thank you. Thank you very much, Ed. Great job. In addition, this evening, we have to send our prayers and support to all the families affected by Hurricane Helene. This has been the worst hurricane response by a president and vice president since Katrina, and this is simply not acceptable.
Those people, I was there yesterday with North Carolina and Georgia. I'll tell you. By the way, the governor of Georgia is doing an excellent job, excellent job. But we have other people that aren't doing a good job, and we have to have them do a good job. But the federal government is doing a very bad job. They are not doing the job, and we have death and destruction that we haven't seen maybe ever. It's a real bad one. They have to get people there because they don't have people there. They don't have the people.
Kamala wined and dined in San Francisco, and all of the people in North Carolina, no helicopters, no rescue. It's just what's happened there is very bad. They're offering them $750 to people whose homes have been washed away. And yet we send tens of billions of dollars to foreign countries that most people have never heard of. They're offering them $750. They've been destroyed. These people have been destroyed. The one young lady washed—You saw that with her son. I wish I never saw it, but just washed away. Your son was washed away with the grandparents. So sad.
They're offering them—giving them $750. Think of it. We give foreign countries hundreds of billions of dollars, and we're handing North Carolina $750. If you want a president who won't even try to save you when the floodwaters are rising, vote for Kamala. She's not the right person. Look, you know what? If they were—if they did a good job, I wouldn't have run, to be honest with you. I didn't need to do this. I didn't need to. If I thought they were doing an even modestly good job, I wouldn't have run.
But I saw right from the beginning, grossly incompetent, and I was right about that. I decided to run, and we're doing really well. I was telling you about polls. We're way up in some polls. We're up in other polls. And with the swing states, I think most of them have us up in every single swing state, including the great commonwealth of a place called Pennsylvania. Don't ever not call it a commonwealth because I've seen people call it a state, and that's the end of them. That's practically the end of their political career.
You got to be very careful with Pennsylvania. It's that commonwealth. I haven't made that mistake. I don't want to either. It was not a pretty picture. If you want a president who will stop at nothing to protect you and your family, I hope you're going to vote for a gentleman named Donald J. Trump. Have you heard of him? [cheers and applause] Together, we will rebuild western North Carolina, rural Georgia, and every other state that's been so badly affected. That includes Alabama.
Virginia was very hit hard. South Carolina was hit very hard, Florida, so many states, Tennessee was hit really hard. They were all hit, and we're going to work with them. And you know, the next president is going to be the one that really once they get—They got to get this done. But once that happens, the next president is going to be the one that has to really help them. JD will be there to help them. I know that.
2024 is the most important election in the history of our country, and here are the facts. My opponent, Kamala Harris, is the most incompetent and far-left nominee ever to run for president. You know, she's much further left than crazy Bernie Sanders. You know that. She wants to open borders. She took the most secure border in US history and turned it into the worst border in the history of the world. Remember, she was appointed border czar. She says she wasn't now after three years, but she was. But whether she was or not, she was in charge of the border.
And the other day I saw her get up and say, ""We will do this. We will do that."" Why didn't they do it four years ago? Why didn't they do it? The damage is so bad and so—It's been done. She let in 21 million illegal aliens from all over the world, from prisons and jails and mental institutions and insane asylums. There are terrorists at record levels, at levels we've never seen before.
She costs you $29,000 a family through inflation price hikes, and now she wants a larger tax hike in—She wants to go to the largest tax hike in American history. There's never been a tax hike like what she's proposing. She's going to raise your taxes a minimum of $3,000. She's a big taxer, and she was the original creator of Defund the Police. I think for all the sheriffs over here, if you're a partner in Defund the Police for even two days, you cannot be president.
But she was one of the founders of Defund the Police, and she still believes that, by the way. I don't know how anybody could, but she still believes that. If she ever had a chance, there's a good possibility she'd go back to it. Can you imagine somebody's robbing our house? Well, there's nothing we can do about it. They tried it. You know where they tried it? In Minnesota with our vice president and it wasn't working out too well. It was working out very well for the robbers and the criminals. That's the only one it was working out well for.
Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE. She wants mass amnesty and citizenship for illegals. And worst of all—This is maybe the worst thing in the whole—that nobody talks. The fake news won't mention it. She lost more than 325,000 migrant children that are now dead, in slavery, or just plain missing, probably never to be seen again, never to see their parents again. But this isn't like—This is 325,000 have been lost.
She praised the idea of a 70% to an 80% tax rate. She imposed a natural gas export ban on Pennsylvania, which is killing your energy workers and your pricing. You know, you have one of the highest energy costs in the country, and yet you're sitting on top of a massive amount of energy that she doesn't want to get. It's been a disaster for your state. Now she's vowed repeatedly, now all of a sudden, she changed her mind.
With politicians, it's always the first statement that comes out to be the one they want. So she's spent 14 years knocking fracking. ""We're never going to have fracking. We're not going to frack."" All of a sudden, a little while ago, she came out, ""I love fracking very much."" No, she'll go back to it. And she even endorsed free sex changes for illegal aliens in detention at taxpayer expense. I don't think Elon likes that idea. These are not ideas that Elon Musk likes too much.
And it was just announced yesterday in California. He took this one from me. I'm so upset. But think of it, that the far less than average governor, Gavin Newscum [sic], has banned any and all ID requirements from voting and registering to vote. You're not even allowed to mention the fact, Elon. You're not allowed to mention the fact. You can't say, ""May I see your ID?"" If you do, it's a criminal act. This like—this is a takeover of the country. You're not allowed to ask for an ID. If you do, it's a criminal count.
Other Democrat states are following. This is only so they can cheat. There's only one thing that you do this for, so that you can cheat on elections. There's no other conceivable reason. Kamala Harris is a radical left Marxist. She is a woman that's not respected in Congress. She was laughed at at [sic] Congress. Nobody thought she could win. They did a coup of Biden, whether you like him or not. I'm not a particularly big fan.
But we had a debate, and debate ended. And all of a sudden, they come to him, and they say, ""We want you out. You're not going to win the election."" He said, ""I don't want to get out."" He got 14 million votes, if you believe in democracy or the system. He got 14 million votes, and she got none. She was the first one out, 22 candidates, and she never made it to Iowa. She quit before Iowa, and now she's running. And that's okay. But we spent $150 million beating Biden.
As soon as he was down and out for the count, they say, ""Let's take him out. We'll get somebody else to run."" Never happened before. We do a lot of firsts. I will tell you. We do a lot of firsts. But she's a person that rated even worse in every statistic than any other senator. She was rated at the bottom of the US Senate. She's destroyed everything she touched, but the good news is that we have a plan to fix it. We're going to fix it, and we're going to fix it fast.
Nobody is going to stand for open borders. Nobody is going to stand for a bad military. Nobody is going to stand for education that's not proper. We're moving education back to the states. [cheers and applause] You're going to be running your own—Education is so important. What's more important than education? But we rank at the bottom of every list. They rank 40 major countries. We're at the bottom, but we're top of the list as the cost per pupil.
We spend more per pupil, per student, than any other country anywhere in the world. So, we're number one in that, and we're number 38, 39 or 40 every single time. And you have Denmark. You have Sweden. You have Norway. You have China's always the top five. Can you believe it? China's the top five. [booing] That's amazing. But we're going to move our education back to the states, so places like Indiana and Iowa and Idaho and states that you don't even hear too much of because they're so good and so well-run, they're going to run their own education. You know what's going to come out of that? A Denmark, a Norway, a Sweden. Maybe, I don't even know, China. Can you imagine? China with 1.4 billion people is a top five and we're close to 40. We are 40 sometimes.
Starting on day one, I will seal the border and stop the migrant invasion into our country. [cheers and applause] We will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of the United States. Dwight Eisenhower right now has that record.
And by the way, it's not something I want to do. I dread having to do it, but we have no choice. What they've done to our country is not even believable, especially the criminals, the criminal element that's in our country. And again, all over the world, crime rates are down because they've taken their criminals, and they've dumped them into the United States. And you know what? I would have been worse than them. I would have had it done even faster.
They've dumped them into the United States of America, and that's what we have. It's dangerous out there. We're getting them out. We're getting them out quickly. We will defeat inflation, and we will make America affordable again. It's going to start with liquid gold. [cheers and applause] We have more liquid gold, oil and gas, under our feet than any nation in the world, including Saudi Arabia and Russia.
We will become energy-independent like we were just four years ago. Four years ago, we were energy independent. Can you believe it? And then we were going to become energy-dominant. We will be dominant within a matter of months, and we will make so much money. We are going to drill, baby, drill. [cheers and applause] We will again open ANWR. Ronald Reagan tried to do it. Every single president from before Reagan tried to do it, and I got it done.
ANWR is the largest drilling site anywhere in the world. It could be larger than Saudi Arabia. It could be larger than Russia. It's in Alaska. I got it done, and we worked to get it done. One of the first things he did was terminate ANWR, and that was going to take care of all of Asia. That was going to make us so much money. We would have paid off debt. I gave you the biggest tax reduction in history. You would have gotten even a bigger one. You were going to be just very happy. You were going to say, ""I like that guy very much.""
20 million Americans are behind on their electric bills right now. It was just announced. 20 million Americans, they're struggling to pay their monthly bills at a record rate. There's never been anything like it. And it's all because of their anti-US energy regime, which has caused Pennsylvania electricity prices to raise almost 50%. We will cut energy and electricity prices in half within 12 months.
We will have your prices, your air conditioning, heating, cars if you buy a Tesla, which is good. Woo [sic], it's good. We will have your energy prices cut in half. It'll be cut in half within a period of one year from January 20th, which is the day we take office. That's going to save you a lot of money. That's going to bring down the prices of everything because more than anything else, people tell me about the groceries, the groceries, our groceries.
And what they're talking about is food. Everything's going to be coming down when we do that. We're also going to get your interest rates way down. We will bring automobile manufacturing back to the United States at levels never seen before, and we will turn the United States into a manufacturing superpower again. It hasn't been there in many, many years. [cheers and applause] We had it started four years ago.
The centerpiece of my plan for a manufacturing renaissance will be a 15% made-in-America corporate tax rate. In other words, if you make your product in the United States, you get a rate. So, I cut it from 39% to 21%. Everyone said that was impossible. I got it done, and we had the best boom we've ever had. We did more revenue when we had it at 21 than when it was at 39. Think of it. Much more. The following year we did much more.
And then I'm going to take it from 21 to 15, which will make us the most competitive country in the world. [cheers and applause] Nobody will be able to compete with us. But that 15 rate only goes for those who make their product in America. They have to make their product here, otherwise, they pay 21. We will protect those companies moving into America, and all of our existing companies, with stiff tariffs placed on companies that don't move in.
If they don't come in, if they don't want to make their product here, that's fine, but they're going to be tariffed. We have to protect our companies, and that's what we're going to do. The only way they can get out of paying those tariffs is to build their plants and factories in America. We may even be able to get Elon to build some of them. I think we will. [cheers and applause] And hire American workers for the job. We're gonna hire American workers for the job.
We will pass the Reciprocal Trade Act. If China or any other country charges us 100 or 200% tax, then we will likewise charge them a 100 or 200% tax. We had a lot of problems on that one with the Senate, and we're going to get that done. Think of it. They charge us, and we don't charge them. Now, they charge us. We're going to charge them the same thing, reciprocal. It's reciprocal.
I will not let Mexico, China, or any other country sell cars into the United States to the detriment of our auto workers who will better than they have ever done. We're going to bring back the car business like it was 50, 60, and 70 years ago. [cheers and applause] Everyone's going to want to be back here. I will not approve Japan buying US Steel, 70 years ago, the greatest company anywhere in the world. It was the greatest company anywhere in the world, and now we have Japan buying US Steel. I don't like that.
We will deliver massive tax cuts for workers, and we will have a policy that I think is so great, no tax on tips [cheers and applause], no tax on overtime [cheers and applause], and no tax on Social Security for our great seniors, no tax. When you think of it, our seniors were hurt so badly. Inflation has killed our seniors. They have a fixed income, and it just got worse and worse every week. Every month, it's gotten worse and worse, and it's just horrible. They haven't gone down. They've only gone up. Prices have still only gone up.
While working Americans catch up, we're going to put a temporary cap on the credit card interest rates at 10%. [cheers and applause] People are paying 28% interest, 25% interest. I will always protect Social Security and Medicare with no cuts. We're not going to do anything with Social Security, but they're going to destroy Social Security because all of the migrants coming in are going on between Medicare, Social Security, other programs, and nobody is able to afford it.
I will settle the war in Ukraine. I will end the chaos in the Middle East, and I will prevent, I promise you, World War III. [cheers and applause] We're not going to have World War III. Right now, we're very close to having it. We will lead the world in space exploration. Thank you, Elon. We will lead the world in military, and we will reach Mars before the end of my term. Elon promised me he was going to do that. I don't know. Can you do that? Stand up. Can we do that?
I think he's going to do it. JD, work on him. Work on him. Work on him. JD is working on Elon. No, he told me that we're going to win, and he's going to reach Mars by the end of our term, which is a big thing, before China, before anybody. And my money's on that guy right there.
We will rebuild our cities, including Washington, D.C., making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. And we will keep the US dollar as the world's reserve currency. [cheers and applause] It's losing right now. It's losing right now. But I'll be able to do it. Other people won't. I'll tell these countries, as they leave us on the—I say, ""You want to do business in the United States? You're going back into the reserve currency. And if you don't, we're going to charge you a big, fat, beautiful tax to do business in the United States."" And they're going to say, ""I would love very much to go back into the US reserve currency."" No, we're going to save it. But these people aren't going to save it. They don't know how to talk. They don't know how to think.
Together, we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates, and low inflation, so that everyone can afford groceries, a beautiful car, and a home. [cheers and applause] Very basic. It's very basic. We will stop the invasion, end migrant crime, strengthen our military, build a missile defense shield around our country, keep critical race theory and transgender insaniticy [sic], we're going to keep it the hell out of our school. [cheers and applause] We're going to keep that insanity out of our school. And as I said, we will keep men out of women's sports. So demeaning to women.
You saw that in the Olympics. They have female boxing, women's boxing, and a young lady from Italy, very good boxer, very, very good. She was all excited. But she played a person who transitioned, person transitioned, a male transitioned to a female, and the young girl from Italy, beautiful young woman, I'm not allowed to say that anymore politically, but I'll say it, she was a beautiful young woman. If you say that, that's the end of your career, right? But it's not. If it is, so be it, okay? We've got to get back to real life. But this beautiful young lady is out, and she gets, boom [gestures punching], a little jab, left jab, and she goes back, ""Oh my God, I've never been hit like that. This is just like a defensive."" Then he goes, the corner said, ""You can take her!"" So, they push her out. Boom, another one. And she says, ""That's enough, I can't do it. I can't take it."" I've never seen anything like it. So, we had two people that transitioned. Both people, shockingly, won the gold medal in their division. So, it's crazy. [booing]
And if you look at weightlifting contests, they're the best of all. For years and years and years ago, they put an eighth of a pound on one side of the barbell, an eighth of a pound on the other. And they can't do it! And the record's standing for 18 years, they just can't do it. And then a guy comes along who never lifted before, and he puts a hundred pounds on, and he goes like this [gestures lifting barbell], like it's nothing. It's so demeaning to women. We're not going to allow it to happen. It's ending. No men playing in women's sport.
And we will defend the Second Amendment, protect religious liberty, restore free speech, and we will secure our elections. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. We need hope. We need the American Dream back, don't we? We're going to have the American Dream. We're going to have the American Dream, so every kid in your family is going to grow up and say, ""I want to be like Elon Musk. I want to have $200 billion in cash. I'm going to be like Elon Musk."" Get to it. That's the American Dream.
But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris, and we must stop her country-destroying radical left agenda once and for all. We cannot have it happen. So, you must get out and you must vote. Here in this incredible Commonwealth, we stand on the shoulders of generations of Pennsylvania patriots, who gave everything they could give, every single thing, for their rights and for their freedom. Pennsylvania is where our founding fathers declared American independence and sounded the beautiful Liberty Bell. It's where the Army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge, where General George Washington led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware. And where generations of top, strong, beautiful miners and steelworkers put Pennsylvania spirit into every single thing they did. [cheers and applause]
And from Gettysburg to Germantown, and Philadelphia to Barren Hill, and from Brandywine to right here in Butler, this is the place where Pennsylvania patriots poured out their blood with the love of their country. They love their country so much. And so, in honor of all those American heroes who came before us, we will press forward, we will push onward, and together we will win, win, win. We're going to win, win, win. [cheers and applause] Nothing will sway us, nothing will slow us, and no one will ever stop us. No matter what dangers come our way, no matter what obstacles we must face, we will keep striving toward our magnificent American future. We will not fail; we will not allow ourselves to fail.
From this day forward, we will always put America first, and we'll take back and save the United States. November 5th, election day, will be the most important day in the history of our country. And together, with the great people of Pennsylvania, we will make America powerful again. [cheers and applause] We will make America wealthy again. [cheers and applause] We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. [cheers and applause] We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Pennsylvania. God bless you. God bless you, Pennsylvania.

[music: Lee Greenwood, ""God Bless the USA""]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Well a very, very big hello, Pennsylvania. We love Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] And it's great to be back in this beautiful commonwealth with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. You are indeed. You are hardworking, proud. You love the country. We're going to save our country. We are going to save it from these lunatics. Before we begin, I want to send our prayers to the people of Florida getting hit just about now. In a little while, you're going to see a hurricane like we haven't seen in a long time, as well as all of the people still recovering from Hurricane Helene. So we have–North Carolina's been hit very hard and this administration has not done a proper job at all. [booing] Terrible, terrible. Nobody's seen anything like it, but we just pray for everybody. We want them all to be good and we're going to be there hopefully soon, and we're gonna help them rebuild and get it all back together. And we hope that God will keep them safe. God will keep them safe. Just 27 days from now, we're going to win Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] We're going to defeat Kamala Harris and we are going to make America great again. And when we beat—Well you know this. When we win, it will be, I believe, the greatest political victory in American history. I believe it will. [cheers and applause] It will be the greatest. We had an incredible evening on Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] We love Butler. Butler's become a very famous place, celebrating the brave firefighter and fire chief. We love Corey [Comperatore], right? Who sacrificed his life in the attack 12 weeks ago. Just take a look at all of the incredible patriots. You have to see this to believe it. Over 100,000 people. Take a look at this. [cheers and applause]
[video plays of crowd at a ""Make America Great Again"" rally in Butler, PA on 10/5/24]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Thank you. Who is that man up there? I don't recognize him. Who is that? From the very beginning of this journey, I've been on a mission to rescue our nation from a failed and corrupt political establishment and to give you back the country you believe in, the country you were born in, and the country you deserve. You're going to get it back. We're all getting it back. In that mission, I will never quit, I will never bend, I will never break, and I will never, not ever, under any circumstances, even in the face of death, we will never give up. Never going to give up. We're going to turn it around. We're going to have the four greatest years we've ever had. I'm putting everything on the line to fight for you. I didn't have to be here. I could be in a beautiful beach. I could be in a gorgeous beach somewhere in the world.
The sun beaming down on this beautiful body in a bathing suit. [cheers and applause] The sun would be beaming down, the waves would be crashing into my face. Instead, I'm here with you in Pennsylvania and I'd rather be doing that. [cheers and applause] [stepping away from microphone] It's true, I'd rather be here.
And all I want is one thing, because we're going to do this. You have to go out and vote. [cheers and applause] That's all. That's all I want. You don't even have to give us any money. That's a pretty good deal, right? Just vote. Vote for all of us. You're not voting for me, you're voting for all of us. We're going to save our country. It's being run by incompetent people that have no idea what the hell they're doing.
Early voting is underway now. So when the polls open tomorrow, don't wait. Go immediately. Go as soon as you can. If you want, you go. Some people want to wait, they want to wait till that beautiful Tuesday that day that's going to be the most important day in the history of our country, I believe. You know, I really believe that. I think we're going to win Pennsylvania. We're leading in all the polls. I shouldn't tell you that. [cheers and applause] I shouldn't tell you. I should say we're down one, we're down one. Get out and vote.
No, we're doing well in Pennsylvania. We're doing well in Michigan. We're doing well in Arizona, Nevada. We're doing well everywhere. We're doing well in places that a Republican hasn't won in years. We're doing well everywhere because people are looking at the people that are destroying our country and they say, ""We're not going to take it anymore."" If we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing. It's over. [cheers and applause] Right? The whole thing. But really nobody makes the case against Lying Kamala Harris better than Kamala herself. Take a look.
[shows video clip]
ANA NAVARRO: Well, if anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?
VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of—and I've been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact. [booing]
[end of clip]
TRUMP: So think of that. So I heard that question when it was given because I had a watch, because she doesn't do any interviews. She doesn't do any press conferences. She doesn't do them for one reason. She's not smart. She's not smart. Not smart. No, she doesn't do them. They're trying to shield. Last time they kept a man in the basement and they had an excuse. They had a thing called COVID around. And we did great last year, I want to tell you. We did great in 2020. We did great in 2016. But we got millions more votes in 2020. Think about that one. So we have to make this too big to rig, right? Too big to rig. [cheers and applause]
So Kamala just said that she can't think of one thing she'd do differently than crooked Joe Biden, right? I'll read off a little list to you. How about the following? She wouldn't do one thing. Remember that. What about the nation-wrecking border invasion, 21 million people? [booing] 21 million people plus came into our nation, and among them are murderers, drug dealers, people from mental institutions, human traffickers, mostly in women. How about that? She wouldn't do that differently? She went from the best border in the world to the worst border in the world. She went from—we had a border that was the best in US history, and now we have the worst border anywhere in the world at any time. There's never been a border like this. What she's done and what he's done, what they have done to this country. The worst inflation in the history, costing a typical family almost $30,000, the inflation, she wouldn't do that over again either.
Maybe the worst of all, and something that a lot of people don't hear about because—Look at all the fake news. That's a lot of fake news. [booing] I think this is the worst of all in a sense. And you'd almost say, how could it be worse? She lost 325,000 migrant children. Their parents are looking for them. Think if you were their parents. Think if you with their parents, 325 due to incompetence, due to the fact that she had the worst border, due to the fact that she let our great people not run the border. She got rid of all the things that we were doing. We had the safest border. We went from the safest to the worst. Those children are now dead, in slavery or just plain missing. Probably most of them will never be found again. Think of that 325,000 because of their incompetence. They're missing. Probably many of them are dead.
Number four, migrant flights, flying illegal migrants into our cities. Remember when she said, ""No, we want to—"" About a month ago, she realized this was not playing well for her and the polls. So they came up with a phony little idea that they'll do something. The only thing they didn't do, though, they didn't stop the flights that were pouring in with thousands and thousands, and actually over the course of a couple of years, hundreds of thousands of people flying over our borders. They didn't stop that. So they came from places all over the world into your cities and small towns changing them forever. And I have to say, ruining them. Ruining your cities and towns, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members, people from mental institutions, and insane asylums, human traffickers and women.
How about number five, the Afghanistan catastrophe, the most embarrassing event in the history of our country? [booing] She wouldn't do that again. You have to understand. She said, ""No, I'd leave it the way it is."" We're just going over just a small list. That was the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. Probably Putin went into Ukraine because of it. He looked and he saw the gross incompetence of this president that can't speak. The October 7th attack on Israel would never have happened. But she said that was fine too, because she didn't want to change. She actually said she didn't want to change anything. She'd leave it the way it is.
So I said, let's make a list of just some of the bad things. This is just a small list. October 7th, where you take a look at what happened. She doesn't want to change that, the slaughter of a lot of people. The Ukraine disaster, millions of dead people because of the weakness of this administration. Putin never would've gone into Ukraine if I were president. It would never, ever have happened. How about the natural gas export ban that is crushing Pennsylvania right now? Most of you don't even know about that. You hear fracking and all. By the way, if she ever won this thing, you wouldn't be fracking for 24 hours. But how about that? And it's crushing Pennsylvania, hurting you. It's going on. It's on right now.
Pushing, how about this, pushing transgender ideology on minor children? [booing] How about that one? Your child goes to school and they take your child. It was a he and comes back as she. [booing] And they do this. And they do it. And often without parental consent. Can you even believe we're saying this? How about, how about men playing in women's sports? How about that? [booing] She wouldn't change. How about the insane electric vehicle mandate where everybody's got to have an electric car almost immediately? [booing] They don't go far. They cost a lot more. And they're going to be made in China. And by the way, I think they're fantastic for a certain group of people that want them. And I'm not saying that because I'm a big fan of Elon, who endorsed us. You know that, he endorsed us. [cheers and applause] Elon's great and he makes a great product. And it is and there's a market for it. It's great. There are people that want it, and I think it's fantastic, actually. But you know what? Some people want gasoline. We have more gasoline. We have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country anywhere in the world.
But I'll tell you, Elon was at Butler. You saw him. He was having the time of his life. [cheers and applause] And I didn't even know we had it. He saw a black hat. You saw that. And it has in a very subtle way with black letters, ""Make America Great Again."" And I didn't even know we sold them and he wore one. And you know his imagination is rather good, like better maybe than anybody in the world. He sends up rockets. What he did with Starlink was so incredible for North Carolina and Georgia and Alabama. [cheers and applause] They said, ""Sir, do you know Elon Musk?"" I said, ""Yeah, I happen to."" He just endorsed us like the best endorsement you've ever heard. He said, ""We're going to save America. If we don't, this country is ruined.""
But think of it. They said, ""Do you know— Because he has something called Starlink and it's very hard to get. It's so popular."" I said, ""What do you need it for?"" He said, ""In North Carolina we have absolutely no communications."" Also, the Governor of Georgia is doing an excellent job. They didn't have any communications in certain sections of Georgia. And I said, ""Well, what do you want? He said, could you get us like Starlink?"" So I called up Elon. I said, ""Elon, what the hell is Starlink?"" [laughing] I said, ""Because North Carolina needs it for communication really badly, and it's very hard to get."" And we talk for about a minute, and all of a sudden I'm getting messages, ""Thank you."" From North Carolina, from Georgia. ""Thank you very much."" I'm still on the phone with him. I said, ""How the hell did you do that?"" He started sending it out and we hadn't finished our conversation.
So we're dealing on a different level with Elon. [cheers and applause] And it was great. It saved them. It saved them because all their wires were ripped down. And I asked the people, I said, ""So what's better? The wires all over the place when they were working or Starlink?"" He said, ""Honestly, Starlink is better."" He said, ""Starlink is better."" So we thank Elon because he helped a lot of people, probably saved a lot of lives. [cheers and applause] And we thank him for the endorsement, right? We thank him for the endorsement.
And I also want to tell you, he made that black hat so—We're selling. So what happened? I didn't even know we had it. It's selling like hotcakes, 10,000 hats were sold in like the last day and a half. But listen, more importantly, he calls it Dark MAGA. [cheers and applause] Dark MAGA. I said, ""That's the coolest name. That's the coolest name I've heard."" And he likes it. He's wearing it all the time now. He's great.
And one more, 11, the worst hurricane response since Katrina. And she's on a fundraising comedy tour while people are stranded and drowning all over some of our greatest states. [booing] So as the floodwaters rose in North Carolina and Georgia and Alabama, Virginia, South Carolina, Florida, Tennessee, Kamala flew—By the way, do you think Biden could have done that? Do you think Kamala could have done it?
CROWD: NO!
TRUMP: No, Biden would've done better. I think Biden would've done better. I think he's smarter than Kamala. You know, he's been reinvigorated. He's looking good compared to Kamala. No, he has been, right?
Look, Mr. Wall, please stand up. Mr. Wall. [cheers and applause] This guy's a wealthy guy, he does great, but he likes the rallies. He's been to like 250. How about front row, Joe, stand up. Will you please? Thank you, guys. They got front row Joes all over the place. Unfortunately, most of them can't get a front row seat. It's one of those problems. Thank you very much for being. A lot of rallies, like 260 something rallies. And Uncle Sam, thank you very much, please. [cheers and applause] The great Uncle Sam. I got to shake his hand. I have no idea who the hell he is. I got to shake his hand two weeks ago. He has the strongest handshake. I'm saying, ""Man, that guy's strong."" Thank you, Uncle Sam. You're great.
Kamala flew to a fundraiser in San Francisco, a city she absolutely destroyed. She destroyed San Francisco. It was the best city in the country and now it's not good at all. Well, families desperately tried to escape the rising floodwaters, and they climbed onto roofs. They did anything they can to live, but Kamala didn't send any helicopters to rescue them. And when people sent helicopters, they turned them back. And by the way, when Elon sent Starlink originally, they confiscated it. They took it. It took them a long time to get it over there. And it's a disgrace. And he doesn't want to say that, but I'll say it. It was disgraceful what they did. So she didn't send anything or anyone at all. Days passed. No help as men, women and children drowned. North Carolina has eight military bases, great bases. Fort Bragg. Remember Fort Bragg? They changed the name. We won two wars, two World Wars, actually, to be specific from Fort Bragg. But they changed the name to, I'm not even going to say it. Let's just call it Fort Bragg.
I think—What do you think? Has nothing to do with Pennsylvania, but the people of North Carolina would like to leave it as Fort Bragg. Can we do that? Yes?
CROWD: Yes!
TRUMP: I think so. But they had rescue helicopters that could have easily be sent, and there was just no coordination. I'm not surprised because I've been dealing with them. There's nothing. But instead, Kamala recorded a podcast known for its graphic content. Can you believe it? She did nothing as people struggled and drowned and day after day, no one came and they still, it's totally deficient. Fortunately, the private sector kicked in and they're really helping and doing a good job, I will tell you. [cheers and applause] It took six days before Kamala and Joe sent a small number of troops to help. And despite all of this, Kamala Harris said she's not going to do anything differently. So if you had your chance, would you do something differently? ""No, no. I'd keep it just the same."" Think of the things I read, and that's a small portion of the incompetence. What they've done to our country is unthinkable. This November—This November, the people of Pennsylvania have to tell Kamala Harris that we've had enough of you. You're an incompetent person. You're the worst vice president in the history of our country, acknowledged to be. Kamala, you are fired. Get out of here. You are fired. [cheers and applause] Get the hell out of here. Get the hell out of here.
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: So her answer that she would do nothing different is disqualifying. Kamala Harris is grossly incompetent, she cannot be trusted, and she is totally ill-equipped to do the job of President of the United States of America. She's ill-equipped. Frankly, Joe Biden is ill-equipped also, but at least he got 14 million votes, right? He's also ill-equipped, but what are you going to do? And let me tell you, he may hate her more than he hates me. That's possible, right? What do you think? Dan, do you think so? I don't know. I think so. I believe it's very interesting what's going on. You see the play now? They're fighting like cats and dogs, the two of them. I believe that he hates her perhaps more than he hates Trump. And I'm a little bit upset about that actually. Our country just went through four years of incompetence and we cannot handle four more years. We're not going to have four more years of it, nor will we have a woke military. We don't have a woke military. This is what we have. This is where we're going. Check it out.

TRUMP: Quite a difference. It's quite a difference, isn't it? We just have to have a little fun in these rather troubled times, don't we? Huh? But there's a lot of truth to that when you see it. We had tough stuff today. It's a little bit different. But I'll tell you what, I know the military well. We defeated ISIS in four weeks. [cheers and applause] It was supposed to take four or five years. We have a great military and they're not woke. Some of the stupid people up top are woke. But you could throw those military people into a woke room, scream at them for two years. They'd come out, they want to fight. Okay? They are great. We have a great military. I saw it because—
By the way, I'm the only president in 78 years that didn't start a war. But I finished wars. [cheers and applause] I finished wars. I finished wars. Remember when Crooked Hillary said, and she said, remember when Crooked Hillary said, ""Look at him. He's going to start a war."" I said, ""No, no, I'm going to stop wars. I'm going to stop them."" And I did. 78 years, 78 years. But I wiped out ISIS at very quick time. They said it was going to take four or five years. I did it in one month because our military is great. [cheers and applause] Our military is great. Just yesterday, it was reported that Kamala Harris brought in a totally unvetted refugee from Afghanistan, who has now been arrested for plotting an ISIS terror attack on the United States during our election. This is the people we've brought in. We've got thousands of them. This is one.
Kamala completely abandoned her duty to law-abiding Americans, and spent the last four years importing criminals, unvetted refugees, and terrorists into our country. As we speak, she has, and this was just announced last week, 13,099, so over 13,000 illegal alien convicted murderers roaming free in our country, murderers that they're released from penitentiaries, prisons and jails. [booing] You got 13,000 plus murderers in our country that were released from jails from all over the world. They come from the Congo, they come from all over the world, not just South America. They do come from South America too.
Do you know the crime rate like in Venezuela is way down because they've sent their criminals into the United States? In fact, I'll make you a deal, if we don't win, if this crazy incompetent person gets it next year, this same group is going to meet in Caracas of Venezuela because it'll be much safer than your particular state. That's where we are. We're going to get these people out. We're going to deport them so rapidly. We're going to get the criminals, the murderers. [cheers and applause] And essentially, I will liberate Pennsylvania and our entire nation from this mass migrant invasion of murderers and child predators and gang members, terrorists, drug dealers, and thugs.
What we have—what they have done to our country is unbelievable. We get up and we talk and we talk. And I noticed something. Somebody was telling me the other day—We do a lot of these beautiful rallies and it's so great. We never have an empty seat, never have. Look at it, we're 100,000 people in Butler, more. Never have an—But they said, ""As you go on, you get angrier and angrier."" It's true because I read this stuff with all of these people being allowed in to destroy our country and by the end of my speech, I'm actually a little bit angrier, in some cases a lot angrier because they're destroying our country.
We will not allow these people to invade us or to conquer us. Do you see what they're doing in Colorado? They're taking over apartment buildings. They're taking over real estate. They become real estate developers from Venezuela. They have equipment that our military doesn't have. Where the hell did they get that equipment? And the Governor of Colorado, who's a weak Democrat radical left, he's beside himself. He said, ""Oh, what do I do? What do I do?"" You get them the hell out of there, that's what you do. [cheers and applause] The Democrats brought them in.
And you know what? Little cities and towns all over the country are being invaded, but the ones that aren't, they're just as scared because they know it's going to happen. Because we have hundreds of thousands of these people, and there's so many of them are criminal. And you know what? If I were the head of, I want to name countries, but they're all friends of mine in one way or the other. I know most of them, almost all of them. But if I were doing that, I would've done it even faster than them. In Venezuela, in many countries, they're emptying their prisons into our country. I would've had—Because Venezuela has only gone about 50%, I would've had it down to 100%. Why wouldn't I? Do you know the money they save and the turmoil they save when they take the criminal gangs from Caracas off the streets and they bus them into the United States and drop them? And do you think anything's going to happen That's going to be good with those people? No, it's not good. It's not good. This is not the American dream.
I will save your communities. I will send home all of those who do not belong in our country. And I will keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. And Kamala is known as the taxing queen, the taxing queen. Her plan will raise taxes for typical American families by an estimated $3,000 a year. Take a look at this.
[start of video montage]
VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax bill.
UNNAMED ANNOUNCER(S): Calling for a full repeal of President Trump's tax cuts—if Kamala Harris was elected president, there are many different tax policies which could cripple the economy, but the first thing she wants to do is allow these Trump tax cuts to expire.—Even the New York Times admits that 85% of the middle class got a tax cut.
Americans will face a hike. The Tax Foundation finding that a couple with two kids making $165,000 a year would have to pay over $2,400 more in taxes.
HARRIS: And on day one, I will repeal that tax bill. Joe Biden and I are about to work to get rid of that tax cut. Joe and I are about to get rid of that tax bill. Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax cut.
UNNAMED ANNOUNCER: Everything from a 70 to 80% tax rate.
HARRIS: I think that's fantastic. We've got to increase the corporate tax rate. Part of that is going to be about repealing that tax bill that they just passed, and also looking at estate taxes are going to have to go up. We will tax capital gains. But we're going to have to raise corporate taxes.
UNNAMED ANNOUNCER(S): Taxing unrealized gains just doesn't seem fair in any sense of the word. Because you're paying for schools.
When the value of your home goes up, you pay higher taxes even if you don't sell your home.
It's tiring.
Your value of your home never moves the way the stock moves to say, ""We're going to tax what you don't have."" That's a sore point and it's a big deal. Is that something you think she firmly believes in?
I think it's part of the proposals of the campaign.
HARRIS: Under my plan, there will also be a carbon fee. There has to be some connection between the fee and bad behaviors, and there has to be, in that we have to monitor whether it's going to be passed on to consumers. But I'm going to tell you that should never be the reason not to actually put a fee, and in particular a carbon fee.
[booing]
UNNAMED ANNOUNCER: Kamala Harris is going to significantly raise taxes.
HARRIS: Taxes are going to have to go up.
UNNAMED ANNOUNCER: Kamala's plan will raise family's taxes by nearly $2,600 a year. Under Kamala, prices have already soared. Now, she'd make it worse with even higher taxes.
HARRIS: Taxes are going to have to go up.
UNNAMED ANNOUNCER: President Trump will cut taxes again. No taxes on tips, overtime, or social security.
TRUMP: I'm Donald J. Trump and I approved this message.
[end of video]
TRUMP: Thank you. So I gave you, as you know, the largest tax cut in the history of our country. And I gave you the largest regulation cut for your companies that hired so many people. We had the best employment numbers in the history of our country. Everybody was working whether they went to the best schools and colleges and got doctorates and all of the different, or whether they couldn't graduate from high school. Men, women, the Black community, the Hispanic community, the Asian community, [cheers and applause] every single group, not one was left behind. And the best ones in terms of proportionately were low-income people. They did the best. And by the way, you have an invasion of people into country, and not including got-aways, more than 21 million people. The got-aways that nobody has any idea how many there are. They're going to be attacking and they already are. The Black population jobs, the Hispanic population jobs, and they're attacking union jobs too. And they're all pouring in.
So when you see the border, it's not just the crime. Your jobs are being taken away too. And it's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. Kamala will deliver a 1929-style depression. I will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates, low inflation and the greatest economy in the history of the world, which is what we gave you before. [cheers and applause] We will pass large tax cuts for workers, and we will have no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on social security benefits for our great seniors. [cheers and applause] That's a big deal.
Do we have any restaurant workers? Do we have any people that work in restaurants? No tax on tips. Remember they tried copying me. They gave it up. They gave it up. You know why? They got killed when they said it. Like a month later? ""Oh, she's going—Uh, we're going to have no tax on tips."" So they toyed with people with their education, with debt, and they said, ""Oh, well, we're going to pay for your college education. We're going to pay."" Never got it done. They won't get anything done. They can't get anything done. They never got it done. To bring jobs, factories, and wealth racing back to Pennsylvania, we will have a 15% made in America corporate tax rate, cutting the tax from 21 to 15, and I got it down to 21 from 39. [cheers and applause]
But, there is a but, but only for those who make their product in America. Made in America. [cheers and applause] One of the biggest guys, highly sophisticated guy, a wealthy guy on Wall Street called me up. He said, ""Who the hell gave you that idea?"" It's so simple, right? You're going to get that additional tax cut, but you have to have your product made in America. Isn't that great? They said, ""Who gave you?"" that's like the paperclip. Somebody came up with the idea of a paperclip many years ago and people saw it. They said, ""Why didn't I think of that?"" But we're going to give a tax cut. You make your product here, because that means jobs, it means a lot of things. It means a lot of great things. And we're going to stop Mexico and China and all these countries from hurting this country because they're hurting it. And they're killing the automobile industry. You're not going to have any cars manufactured here. If we win, this country will become the automobile manufacturing place. [cheers and applause] We will bring plants back at levels that haven't been seen for 50 years in this country.
Right now, the Chinese are building big factories, auto plants in Mexico. They think they're going to make cars and send them over to our border and put everybody in Detroit out of business, put everybody in South Carolina out of business. Not going to happen, because I'll put 100 or a 200% tariff. We don't want their cars. We want to make our cars here. And that includes in Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] And for those who don't make their product in America, they will be forced to pay a rather stiff tariff for the privilege of competing with our cherished companies that we're going to take care of. And for the privilege of stealing our jobs, our treasure and our wealth, they're going to do that, that's okay, but they're going to pay something for it and it's going to be substantial. And we will take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.
And let me tell you, for 30 years, for 25 years, China didn't pay 10 cents to this country. And when I was president, they paid hundreds of billions of dollars, hundreds of billions. [cheers and applause] Not 10 cents. They literally never, they went under the guise, we are a developing nation. Well, we're a developing nation too. We're like, our nation's gone like this. We got to get it back up, but we're going to get it back up fast. But American citizens will use all that money. We're going to pay off debt. We're going to reduce your interest rates, we are going to, by the way, two things. When I was president, the interest rate was 2%. Now it's 10%, but it's not really 10% because you can't get any money at 10%. The American Dream for young people is gone. They can't buy a house. You can't get any money.
So it's not 10%, it's 11, 12, 13, 14, 15%.
CROWD MEMBER: What the hell.
TRUMP: It was 2%. Five years ago we had 2% and now we have not 10, probably 14 or 15 before you get it. But that puts you out of business, tariffs against us. Remember this, one thing is going to happen, or another thing. Number one, they're going to drop all tariffs against us. We have countries that charge us 150 and 200%, and we charge them nothing. And I started it and it was good. We were making a fortune. And then these idiots came in and they changed it. But we're going back to it. It's a pro-American. It's America First policy if you don't mind, America First. [cheers and applause] We have America First. And I believe my pro-American trade policies are one of the major reasons why I've been overwhelmingly endorsed by the rank-and-file membership of the Teamsters. Never happened, it never happened. [cheers and applause] Including 65% of Teamster members in the Great Commonwealth, by the way, never call it a state. That's a very bad, that's career-threatening. I had a politician who was a friend of mine. He walked in and he started talking about the state. I said, ""Oh, he's dead."" He was dead. You can't do that.
David would never do that, right? No, you can't do that. You got to be very careful. The only thing worse is when Biden would get up, remember? And he'd talk about, he's in Idaho and he'd say, ""It's great to be in Iowa."" They'd say, ""No, no."" But the worst was when he was in New Hampshire and he said, ""It's great to be in Florida."" That's palm trees. And you could be Winston Churchill. He was a great orator, a great, great orator, one of the greats. And if you make that mistake, no matter how good you are, the speech is a total disaster. Do you agree? But we don't make mistakes like that. We need every one of those Teamsters to get out and vote. Do we have any of the Teamsters here? Do we have them here? Oh, look at that. Thank you fellas. Appreciate it. We appreciate it.
The migrants are coming after your jobs, but I don't think you're going to be worried. I think you're going to be, they'll be okay. I know, they're tough cookies. They're going to be all right. Thank you very much. Thank you everybody. We appreciate it. Really. Because it's jobs. They may be union, they may be not union. It's jobs. We want to protect our jobs. I don't care which jobs, we're going to protect our jobs. We're not going to let these countries come in and steal our product, and steal our companies. And all we're left with is one thing. Unemployment, it's not happening, not going to happen. And it's a very simple thing to do. It's essentially what they do. But see, we can do it better, because we have now this country. But if this country keeps going along the way it's going, we're not going to have that advantage anymore.
So we're leading in every key national battleground, just about poll. We're just, as I was coming up here, Rasmussen, highly, highly respected. One of the most accurate. They have us up by two points nationally. But don't be fooled, if we're up by two, it's about like 10. You know why? Because people can't poll Trump. That's what happened with Crooked Hillary. They thought they were going to win because they say to the people, they call up, who are you voting for? A Trumper, like these guys. They love Trump. Who are you voting for? ""I'm voting for Crooked Hillary Clinton. Or I'm voting for Lying Kamala Harris."" I don't use the name Harris. When you use the name Harris, nobody. If I say, ""Yeah, I'm up against Harris.""
CROWD MEMBER: Who?
TRUMP: They say, ""Who the hell is Harris?"" No, nobody knows. You have to say Kamala. Look, all my political warriors over there, the insider advantage has just come out where we have nationally, three points. We have in Pennsylvania, a three-point lead, which probably means 10. [cheers and applause]
And a brand-new Quinnipiac Poll shows us leading in Michigan by four and in Wisconsin by two. It's all good, but you got to get out. We cannot sit back. And we've made a lot of progress over the last, she had that little honeymoon period before she started talking. Once she started talking, I didn't know was it that I did a good job or that she's just so bad? You know what? Who cares. I say, who cares? Pennsylvania also needs to defeat your disastrous radical Democrat Senator Bob Casey. [booing]
And we want to elect the next Senator from Pennsylvania, Dave, you know David McCormick, he's right here. David McCormick. [cheers and applause] And I'll tell you, I'll tell you, I know him for a long time. He went to the best schools. He did that. He got great marks. I think that means something. It does mean something. How did Biden do, by the way? How did Kamala do? Not too good. How did she do? Not too good. I will tell you right now, this guy was a great student. He was a great soldier. He was a great businessman. He's tough as hell. David, I know you just spoke. Just come here, say, like for two seconds because nobody wants to hear you right now. Just come up. But we got to get this guy in office. Come on. Give me a little bit.
DAVID MCCORMICK: Thank you Mr. President. All right. It all comes down to the Keystone State. Right here. Right here, Mr. President, we're going to put you back in the White House right here in the Keystone State. [cheers and applause] We're going to win a majority in the Senate right here in the Keystone State. [cheers and applause] And we're going to save America right here in the Keystone State. Thank you. [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Thank you. He's really good. And he will be such a great Senator. He'll be phenomenal. And, you know, I know Casey, I was in Washington for four years. I don't know if I ever even met Casey, but he's been there a long time. He's boring. Nobody knows who the hell he is. Think of it. And he doesn't fight for you. He just votes the way the Democrats tell him to vote. This guy will be a leader and he'll bring business back to your st—your Commonwealth. Ooh. That was a close one. He's going to bring business back to the Commonwealth like you won't believe, he's going to be a great Senator for a long time to come. And thank you very much for being here, David. Great job. [cheers and applause]
We're also joined as well by warriors, members of Congress, who are great friends of mine. They've become great friends. When you're in war, we're at like a war because we have an enemy on the outside. Maybe China, maybe. Honestly, if you have a smart president, they're always going to be fine. They're always going to be fine. Because they always need something and they're always going to be fine. I have great relationships with a lot of these countries that nobody else can talk to, like, as an example, Ukraine never ever would've happened. Israel never, ever would've happened. The October 7th would've never happened. You would've never had inflation. You wouldn't have had that disaster in Afghanistan, the most embarrassing moment in the country's life. But I became friendly with these people, and they are. They're warriors. You have great ones here. Some places don't have them as good. I must be honest with you. I refuse to say who, but here, you have great ones. Dan Meuser. Thank you, Dan. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Dan. Great job. Thank you for all the help. You did so many things, he helped us on, Right To Try. You know what Right To Try is? It's such an important thing. We saved so many lives. He helped us so much. Lloyd Smucker. Lloyd, thank you very much. Great job. [cheers and applause] Been my friend. John Joyce. [cheers and applause] John, thank you. You're fantastic people. And Kat Cammack from Florida, Kat, thank you. [cheers and applause] Whoa. Wow. That's good. That's very good. Thank you very much Kat. And you heard Vivek. [cheers and applause] How about Vivek? Great guy. We're going to bring him in. I don't want to tell him yet exactly. We're going to pick the right, because I don't like talking, first I like to win. We got to win. Somebody said, ""Oh, sir, who's going to be Secretary of State?"" I said, ""Do me a favor. Let's win first, okay?"" Vivek knows that, but he's going to be a part of something that's going to be really big. Thank you, Vivek. Great job. Thank you. [cheers and applause]
You know, he started off as a rookie, and he did very well. He did very well. He wiped out a lot of guys that have done this stuff for a long time, didn't he? Very well. It's great. Great to have you. Great family too. In four incredible years under the Trump Administration, we've achieved more than any administration in the history of our country actually. We passed record tax cuts and record regulation cuts. We achieved all-time, low unemployment rates, record low poverty rates. We had the lowest, think of it. We had the best in terms of poverty, the best numbers you've ever had, and rising wages for everyone. Wages that rose at a level never seen before. We ended the NAFTA disaster, canceled the TPP, which would've taken all of your business out of Pennsylvania, withdrew from the ridiculous Paris Climate Accord. [cheers and applause] I want to call it the Pennsylvania Climate Accord, not the Paris Climate. No, they were ripping us off. We had to pay a trillion dollars. Russia had to pay nothing. India had to pay nothing. China had to pay nothing. [booing]
We had to pay a trillion dollars. I said, ""So far the deal's not looking too good."" I tell you what, as a business guy, I went in and I looked at some of these deals. I said, ""Who the hell negotiated these deals?"" I said, ""Hanky-panky going on, I think."" Of course, Biden got a lot of money from China. They never say that, the fake news never talks about it. [booing] If that were me, if that were me, I'd be excoriated. Remember I said at the debate, I said, ""Let me ask you, how come the mayor of Moscow's wife paid this man three and a half million dollars?"" And Chris Wallace said, ""Please don't ask him that question."" Two weeks later, it became a hot subject. Don't ask him the question. And nobody really did ask him the question, right? I won the big case in Florida. He had a similar type of case, but the difference is, I have Presidential Records Act. My was 100% fine. I won it, I beat deranged Jack Smith. He's a deranged individual.
But Biden had a similar case, but he didn't have Presidential Records Act right? And Biden was essentially convicted. Think of this. Here was the decision. ""He's incompetent, so he doesn't have to stand trial."" So think of this. He's incompetent, so he doesn't have to stand trial, but he's allowed to be the President of the United States. Does that sound good? [booing]
I don't think so, but I'll be honest with you. I honestly believe that he's more competent than Kamala. I believe that. I believe he's more competent. And I thought he looked really good today because we were comparing the two of them. And who looked better? He looked sharper than she did. Can you believe this? But I stood up to China like nobody has ever stood up before, bringing in billions and billions and billions of dollars. And remember, I said it before, nobody ever brought in 10 cents. Not one other, not 10 cents. You check those records. We had the most secure border in U.S. history, fully rebuilt the United States military, and we created a new, beautiful, beautiful thing. I just love it. Wrapped up all perfect. It's called Space Force. Not since Air Force, 78 years before, Air Force, 78 years ago, we obliterated ISIS. And with the Abraham Accords, we made peace in the Middle East. We had the Abraham Accords. [cheers and applause]
If Obama even thought about an idea like that, he would've gotten a Nobel Prize. With me, I said, ""Don't waste your time. They're never giving it."" They don't give it, they don't give me anything. All we do is produce. We produce. I just want to produce for you. I don't care about them. And I'm proud to be the first president in decades who started no new wars. [cheers and applause] That's very good. But those four incredible years of peace and prosperity, and that's what we have. I shake hands with people. ""Sir, it was so good when you were president, and I'm not doing well now, sir, I'm not doing well."" They've been cut off with taxes and with regulations. It's horrible what they're doing. But they've been followed by four years of misery and failure under the worst president and vice president in American history. This is the worst president and vice president, this is the worst administration in the history of our country. The only one happy about it is Jimmy Carter, because Jimmy Carter, Jimmy Carter is considered, and his administration is considered brilliant by comparison. Would you say that's true Vivek, David, yes?
Now, Jimmy Carter had a brilliant administration by comparison. So he's quite happy. He's a pretty old guy. Just turning 100 or just about, right? He's 100 years old. And he's a nice man actually. He's a very nice man. But here are the facts. Kamala Harris is a radical left Marxist, rated even worse than Bernie Sanders. And even worse than Pocahontas. Do you know Pocahontas? Elizabeth Warren, Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren. Remember? She said, ""I'm Indian."" Everyone said, ""Well, do you have any proof?"" ""No. My mother said that I had high cheekbones."" That's what she said. So I came up with the name Pocahontas, and it drove her crazy. And so she went out and got a blood test, right? Remember what the number was? 1,024th. Oh, this guy's good. 1,024th. That means essentially that I have more Indian blood in me than she has, and I have none unfortunately. [cheers and applause] I'd like to have some. I'd be honored to have some, but I have none.
She thought it was so good that she had 1,024th, it's like not even possible. It's not possible. And she was happy. She was so happy that she released a number. She thought it was good. And that was the end of her political career. She was leading in the presidential race back then. That was the Biden race. And you know where Kamala was? She had dropped out. She was dead last. She dropped out. She'd never made Iowa. And do I love Iowa. I love Iowa. I love corn. I love Iowa. Now, Iowa is great. We have a big lead in Iowa. Never lost in Iowa. Well, we had a great many years, what was it, 36 years. Nobody won Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] And then Trump came along and we won Pennsylvania. And I'll tell you, there's more spirit now than I've ever seen. I'm talking about nationwide, because we have another factor. You like me, and you know that I'm a very competent person.
CROWD MEMBER: We love you.
TRUMP: But you know how, thank you. Thank you. I love you too.
CROWD: TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!
TRUMP: Thank you. But now you see, but now you see how people can destroy our country. You know, the President has tremendous power. A president has tremendous power. And you can make or break a country. If you're stupid, if you don't know what you're doing, look at, the whole world is laughing at us. Five years ago, we were respected. Your president was respected, and our country was respected. And Victor Orban, one of the toughest leaders in the world, the strong people, the press hates him. They say, ""He's a tough leader."" Well, sometimes you need a tough leader, but highly intelligent guy, very strong person from Hungary. He's the head of Hungary.
And he made a statement. They said, ""Why is it that the whole world is going crazy?"" The whole world. Remember me? I had no wars. I had no anything. We had no terrorists. We had no terror attacks. Everybody was happy. We had no terrorist attacks. But he said, ""Why?"" They asked him, ""Why is it?"" They said, ""Because Trump's not president. If he becomes president, the whole world, because,"" and I don't use this word. I don't like the word for myself. I'm just saying the word. He said, ""The whole world was afraid of him. China was afraid. Russia was afraid. Everybody was afraid."" [cheers and applause] And I don't like that. I'd like to say respect, but I'm just saying what he said. So, because otherwise they'll say, ""Oh."" These guys are so bad. A big part of our problem in this country are those people right back there. [booing] Big part of our problem. We need a free and fair press. Badly, desperately. I watched the way they ask questions of Kamala yesterday. Howard Stern, he's a weak guy. He's weak. [booing]
He's going, ""Oh, oh, what about, oh."" It was so, even she was embarrassed. It was like softball, but all of them, Howard, I knew him very well. I was on his show many times. I used to think he was good. Then I dropped him, I dropped him like a dog. And his ratings are very challenged. Very challenged.
But I watched the questions. I watched that stupid View where you have these really dumb people. Whoopi Goldberg said, would you participate in a movie? She made some movie on basketball. This was before I ran for politics. She said, oh, you're so great. If you ever ran for president, you'd win. This is Whoopi Goldberg. You don't hear that. She said, I'm making a movie. Would you be in it? I said, in what capacity? Just a walk on. You're so great. Would you do it? I did a walk-on for Whoopi Goldberg. Now she says, I refuse to mention his name. You know what? Politics can do strange things to demented people. [cheers and applause]
Now, I've hired Whoopi to work for me as a comedian before this stuff, a long time ago. I went and I'm not particularly shy about what I hear. Her mouth was so foul. Every word out of her mouth was like the F-word that this. I was with a group of people, nice people, and we had to leave. She was so filthy, dirty, disgusting. Half the place left. I said I'd never hire her again, but she was so dirty. Every word was filthy dirty and I left. Then I see her sitting about, oh, Whoopi Whoopi. What a loser she is. [cheers and applause] But I watched the way they ask questions and it's like they're the same, like they are partners in this crime that's being committed.
Kamala, again, she was last in the primary. She was the first one to drop out of like 22 people and now I'm running against her. Now, I don't mind. I have a feeling that if they left Joe in by the time it's finished, because dropping like a rock now because she's actually forced to speak. Because she's behind, she's forced to go on and she's speaking and because she's speaking, people are realizing she's a dumb person and we can't have another dumb president. We've had enough. [cheers and applause] Can't have it. No, the country can't take it. I don't want to be nasty.
Somebody said to me, one of my people, a nice person. Staff person said, sir, please don't call her dumb. The women won't like it. The women want to see our country come back. They don't care. [cheers and applause] The women are tougher than the men, right? It's tough. I said, don't worry. I said, don't worry about the women. They'll be okay. They're going to be okay. You know what? They don't want millions of people coming through our border. They don't want militaries pushing us around. They don't want crime in the middle of our streets. They don't want hundreds of thousands of migrant criminals. Criminals. They don't want them walking down Madison Avenue in New York and Fifth Avenue and the shops being emptied. They want to see a country that works. We're going to have a country that works very, very soon and the women are going to like Trump. I think they like me anyway. I think it's all bullshit. [cheers and applause] They make it up. Thank you.
Kamala was an original creator of defund the police, okay? You know she was one of the originals, because she's a radical left person. Her father is a Marxist economist. I don't know what that means, a Marxist economist. But a Marxist economist. I'd love to meet the father. Where's the father? I want to meet the father. I might like him. I like Barack Hussein Obama's brother very much. He endorsed me. [cheers and applause] I like very much Tampon Tim's family. His family endorsed me. Tampon Tim, they endorsed me. The family of Tim, a terrible governor, the job he does is terrible. Anybody who wants to defund the police for even one week or one day is not worthy of being President of the United States. Okay? [cheers and applause]
Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE. She wants mass amnesty for illegals, which will bankrupt Medicare and social security. These people coming in, I believe they do it for the votes. They really want to get them on the voting rolls. The amazing thing is a poll came out the other day with Hispanics. First time ever, Trump is leading. Look at her. Beautiful. [cheers and applause] Trump is leading. Never have. I think stupid Mitt Romney was at like 4% or something. How about him? How do you like having him as a partner? Mitt Romney, what a weak lad, we're getting him the hell out of here. But she wants to ban fracking. Her whole life, she talked about we will ban fracking, we will ban fossil fuels. Now all of a sudden, a little while ago, she said, that's not working too good. I love fracking very much. You know why? Because of your Commonwealth, she's now going around saying, I love fracking.
Let me tell you, this ever happened. Day one, there's no fracking and that's the end of Pennsylvania because it's the biggest factor in Pennsylvania. She imposed a natural gas export ban on Pennsylvania, which is killing you. It's currently in effect, by the way, just in case you don't know. She lost more than 325,000. I'm just giving you the same numbers that I gave you before with her answer. And Attorney General—as Attorney General, she destroyed the state of California. As DA, she destroyed San Francisco. Now she wants to destroy the United States of America.
When she was the Attorney General of California, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon and rape of an unconscious person as nonviolent crimes. She said, under no circumstances will they be prosecuted. [booing] She called them nonviolent crimes. They're pretty violent. Look, she's a liberal. She's a very liberal, she's not even liberal. Remember I used to say State of the Union, we will not be a socialist country. We will never ever be a socialist country. [cheers and applause] I was right. We're a communist country. They skip socialism now. I was right. They skip socialism. They to the next rung, communism. So I was right. We will never be a socialist country. Boom. They skipped it. So I was right. I like to be right.
She pledged to confiscate your guns and endorsed a total ban on handgun ownership. [booing] So I have the total endorsement of the NRA. How many people in here own a gun? [cheers and applause] All of my congressmen, they're not sure what they—Look at that. Dan, you know what to do. All of my congressmen, they're a little bit shy about that. But she will confiscate your guns, she's going to take your guns away. Just so you know. [booing] She sponsored a bill to impose a 100% ban on gas-powered automobiles. Congratulations. I'm sure you'll sell your automobile for a lot. That will be ended on day one. Okay, day one, boom. I will sign that on day one. I'm going to sign a lot of things. My hand will be very sore from signing. I'll walk out, I'll say, man, that's a lot of signing, and I've signed a lot of things.
She even called for free sex changes for illegal aliens in detention. [booing] No. We are talking about major radical left stuff here. This is top of the line. It's true. Far left of Bernie Sanders. In fact, even Bernie Sanders said, you know what he said the other day? It's about time I put my foot down. We can't do this. He's complaining. Now Bernie is saying, I've got to put my foot down. This is too much. She is the worst. Perhaps most revealing of all, and it's the simplest of all, for the last three years, I heard how she slaved over the French fry oven at McDonald's. ""I worked so hard. It was so hot, the heat. I'd get burns. Oh look, it was a burn. I got a burn. I still have a scar. It was horrible."" Only one problem. She never worked at McDonald's. It was a lie.
In one way, I hate that. It's too simple. The fake news will say, oh, it's such a—But they refused to report it. They reported that she worked there, but when it turned out to be a fake, they didn't want to talk about it because they're fake. Hence, the term fake news. [booing] They're fake. No, they'll get [inaudible] because they've almost lost all credibility now. You can hardly read the papers. A lot of people like your accounts, your taxi drivers. You hear a lot of different things.
But you don't know, when we deal, when these guys deal and they go up and they give them a story and they know exactly what the story is and they give them the correct stuff and then they write it the exact opposite. A lot of people don't know that they are truly corrupt people. They are corrupt and they are the enemy of the people. [booing] They are the enemy of the people. We know than we know better than the others because we give them—Right John? We give them the information and then they write it the opposite and it's really disgusting. But here we are. We're leading for the presidency. So I don't know what the hell power they have. [cheers and applause]
Yesterday Tampon Tim said that they want to abolish the electoral college, take away all electoral power from the voters of Pennsylvania. They want to add in many cases they're talking about many, they're thinking about, first time I heard this number, 25, they want to have 25 supreme court justices. 'Cause it's the only way they're going to gain the power they think. No, they have to wait their turn. It could come back. It's the first time I've ever heard the number. It's got to be uneven. You know that right? Got to be. So I figured they'd stop at maybe 11, maybe 13. No, that's an unlucky number, so 15 maybe. Yesterday, first time I heard 25, they want 25. Tampon Tim and Kamala Harris are a true threat to democracy. I'm not the threat to democracy. By the way, if I was, I wouldn't have taken a bullet to the ear. I wouldn't have taken a bullet to the ear. [cheers and applause] They didn't.
CROWD: TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!
TRUMP: But with your vote this November, we are going to defeat these radical left country destroyers and we are going to finish what we so brilliantly started. We had the greatest economy in history. On day one, I will seal the border, stop the migrant invasion, and we will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country. We have no choice. [cheers and applause] The illegal migrants coming into our country are taking the jobs of American citizens, the black and Hispanic communities in particular. I will end inflation and we will make America affordable again. We're going to drill, baby, drill. We're going to get the energy cost way down. [cheers and applause]
I will fight for and protect social security and Medicare with no increases of age. How would you like to be—It's going to happen with them. Some nice guy worked hard, he's getting ready to reach that certain age and they announced you're going to have to wait an extra six years. No, it's not going to happen. Not with me. It didn't happen. Remember that? It didn't happen. It won't happen. Uncle Sam, I promise you. We will make America the dominant energy producer in the world by far, and we will frack, frack, frack and drill, baby, drill. [cheers and applause]
And I will cut your energy prices in half, 50%, within 12 months of taking office. Get it down 50%. We'll do it because we have so much. We don't even use our energy. We will terminate Kamala's insane electric vehicle mandate so you're allowed to drive to Washington without four stops, okay? I'd prefer not stopping four times. I will stop outsourcing and turn the US into a manufacturing superpower, especially with the car industry. They are going to love me in Michigan and maybe that's why I'm leading in Michigan. I'm leading by a lot in Michigan. I think the car workers—I think the auto workers are going to love me maybe more than anybody else because if I don't win, there will be no auto workers within three years. We won't make any cars.
Working with Elon Musk, we will slash a record amount of government waste and fraud and abuse. [cheers and applause] He's very good at that. I will end the war with Ukraine while I'm president elect. I won't even wait to get into office. I'll end it. [cheers and applause] Stop the chaos in the Middle East and prevent World War III, which is going to happen. World War III. We're closer to World War III than we have ever been. We've never been this close. This will be a war like no other because it's nuclear power. And this is not two army tanks, as I say, going back and forth and shooting at each other, Uncle Sam, right? This is levels of power and carnage and it's obliteration time. We can't let that happen and we won't have it. We will not have World War III.
These people don't even talk. I saw Biden hasn't spoken to Putin in, you know, like years or something. You got to end that war. That war is ridiculous. We got to end that war and I'll end it fast. I know both of them. I know Zelensky, I know Putin, we will get it ended. I will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources and respect that they so dearly deserve. [cheers and applause] We will strengthen and modernize our military. You know, I totally rebuilt our military and we gave $85 billion worth of it to the Taliban. [booing]
Did you see, there's another thing we were going to get out with dignity and strength, but you got to take out the military less. He took out the military first. Not smart. A five-year-old—Remember I had the five-year-old on stage. I gave him the stats. Would you do it first or last? ""Sure, I'd take out the military last."" ""Thank you. Go back to your mom."" Thank you. But Biden took it out first with Kamala's blessing. We will build a missile defense shield all made in the USA and a lot of it made in Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] We're entitled to it. It's our technology. Why aren't we doing it all made right here? Jobs, jobs, jobs.
We will lead the world in space and reach Mars before the end of my term. I said to Elon, is that doable? Absolutely. He loves rockets, that guy, man. Never seen a guy that likes rockets so much. First time I got a glimpse, I said, who did that? Remember when the rocket engines came down? They have no wings, no nothing. I said, what the hell is that? I'm looking. It wasn't a missile; it was just a round tube. And it came down. It landed right on a barge, a circle. Four of them or three of them came right down, landed right on a circle from space. I said, who the hell did that? It was Elon Musk. I called him. I said, what's that all about? He said, well, engines are very, very expensive. So if we could save them and through certain this and that, we were able to do it. It's so incredible. They can use them again and again and again. How smart. How smart. And he said, we can do that. We'll be in Mars before the end of our term.
A lot of it also though does have to do with the military because we don't want to just send rockets up. The military, it's going to be a very important factor. Space Force is turning out to be a very big deal because a lot of the military is going to be surveillance, and everything will be having to do with space. We were being obliterated when I took office by China and by Russia in space. We are now leading by a lot. I put a guy in there who's done a phenomenal job, but Space Force has been a fantastic thing and a very important thing.
We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington DC, which is so embarrassing. It's got graffiti all over the marble. It's got potholes all over the road. We're going to fix our capital and make it beautiful and we're going to be proud of it again. And our cities will be clean and safe and beautiful. We're not going to have crime. We're going to stop the crime. We're going to let the police do their job. I will support universal school choice, which is a big deal for people. [cheers and applause] We will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our school, [cheers and applause] and we will keep men out of women's sports. [cheers and applause]
I will defend the Second Amendment as I have done for four years, and it wasn't easy. [cheers and applause] Protect religious liberty, restore free speech, and we will secure our elections like they have never been secured before. We want voter ID. Did you see in California, Gavin Newscum [sic]? Listen to this. He passed a bill, he signed a bill that nobody is even allowed to ask anybody for voter ID. If they ask, it's a criminal act or something. So there will be no voter ID. Now there's only one reason they want that, to cheat. But think of this.
He took it a step further. Gavin Newscum [sic], he has destroyed California. For me, it's hard to say these things because I have property in California. I have a lot of property in California and I hurt myself. But what I'm doing now is much more important than my properties. It's really much more important. [cheers and applause] Every time I say that, what a rotten job he's doing, I say, well, that's going to cost me a lot of money every time, but it doesn't matter to me. If it did, I wouldn't be doing this right now. Right? I wouldn't be doing.
But under our administration—And by the way, how good did JD Vance do the other night? [cheers and applause] Everyone will prosper. Every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris. Should be easy, should be very easy. And stop her radical left agenda once and for all, you have to get out and vote. We're going to make this a landslide. We want to make it a real referendum. We want to make it something where you go and you say, we have the right to stop crime in our cities. We want to make it big and we want to make it so that they can't cheat. If you win by a lot, they can't cheat. They can only cheat so much and they are cheatin' dogs. I will tell you that.
Early voting in Pennsylvania is underway. What the hell are you doing sitting here? Go. [laughing] So get everyone you know, thank you Uncle Sam. Look at that. He's the greatest. I love Uncle Sam. Look at him. Thank you Uncle Sam. [cheers and applause] He's the greatest, that guy. I don't know who the hell he is. He goes to a lot of rallies. Mr. Wall, do you know? I don't know, but he's great actually. So get everyone and go vote.
After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years of the history of our country. I believe that. I also believe that if we don't do this, I don't think it'll ever happen. I think our country's going to be destroyed. They're destroying our country. You'll have 200 million people come in from all over the world, including prisons and mental institutions. With your help from now until election day, we will redeem America's promise. We will put America first and we will take back the nation that we love. We love this nation. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country. Together we will make America powerful again. [cheers and applause] We will make America wealthy again. [cheers and applause] We will make America healthy again. [cheers and applause] You know who is going to do that? RFK Jr. He's got some good ideas. [cheers and applause] We love RFK Jr, don't we, Vivek? Between the two of these guys. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. [cheers and applause] We will make America great again. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Pennsylvania. God bless you. God bless you, Pennsylvania. Get out and vote. Thank you. Thank you, fellas.

    UNNAMED ANNOUNCER: Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome the next president of the United States, President Donald J. Trump!
[music: Lee Greenwood, ""God Bless the USA""]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Wow. Hello, everybody. This was supposed to be a little gathering in a plant. This was supposed to be just a little gathering. This is a lot of people outside, trying to get in. I want to thank everybody and I want to say here a very, very special hello to Scranton, and also to Pennsylvania. Can you all hear me? [cheers and applause] Turn this sucker up, please. Turn it up. Get this mic turned up, because I heard somebody say, ""Louder."" I've never had this. I've never heard that before. Turn it up. It's great to be back in the beautiful Commonwealth with thousands of proud, hard-working American patriots.
Just 27 days from now, we are going to win Pennsylvania, we are going to defeat Lying Kamala Harris. [cheers and applause] Lying Kamala, she's a liar. We're going to make America great again, right? [cheers and applause] And as you know, early voting is underway. So, when the polls open tomorrow, we're here, we're finally here. And you know we're way up in your—I want to say, look, let's do it this way. The main thing is to win. Let's say we're one point down. I don't want to tell you. We're actually up, but I want to say we're one point down. Everybody get to the polls, so we get these horrible politicians out of there. [cheers and applause] We want to get rid of them.
No, we're actually up in the polls in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Arizona just came out, we're up in Arizona, very substantially. We're way up in the polls, and the only place we're down, New York Times has a headline that we're down a little bit, but they're the only poll. Every poll, you got to see these polls, they're the best polls. New York Times, as we call it, the failing New York Times, it's fake news. These people are sick. [cheers and applause] Do you remember in 2016, they had to do an editorial, apologizing to their readers because they said, ""He's going to lose, he's going to lose, I swear he's going to lose."" And then I won, and they lost thousands and thousands of—I love that. It's going to happen again.
No, I came on today to the plane, and Susie and everybody says, ""Sir, you're up in this poll, you're up in this poll, you're up in this poll, you're up in every poll."" And then I picked up The New York Times, it said I'm losing by a whisker. They hope. They hope. No, they're fake news. You know they're all fake news, these people? They're totally crooked. They're so crooked. They're the enemy of the people. [cheers and applause] They are. They are the enemy of the people. So, get everyone you know and vote immediately, because that's the only one that counts, you know? November 5th, that's called our big poll. That's the real poll, right?
And they're going to cheat like hell and everything else. You know if they only cheat a lot, we're in great shape. But if they cheat in record-setting numbers, which they're capable of doing, I can't promise, but they are—they are cheaters. That's the way they do. When they have their first meetings—Our first meeting is, ""Where would be a good place to go? How about Scranton?"" You know what their first meeting is? Their first meeting is, ""How do we cheat? How do we cheat?"" That's all they—Because when you think about it, who can win with high taxes, open borders, allowing murderers to come in? You saw that last week, 13,099 murderers allowed to come in through them, over three and a half—13. Many of them have murdered more than one person. Is there anybody in the audience that's in that group, please? Because if they are, we want to get the hell out of here, or get him out of here.
If we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing, it's very simple, we win. [cheers and applause] And your taxes will come down and your safety will go up. But we had an incredible evening here on Saturday, you probably heard about it. Maybe some did, maybe some didn't. I don't know. It was in a beautiful place called Butler, Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] And we were celebrating the brave firefighter Corey [Comperatore], who sacrificed his life in the attack, 12 weeks ago now already. And he really was, he jumped on top of his wife and daughters. He got hit. Man, he got hit. Two other gentlemen, two other—All Trumpers. To the nth degree, all Trumpers. But two others got hit too. They said they were dead, they weren't going to make it.
And the doctors, you have very good doctors in Pennsylvania, I tell you, they're doing well. They're doing well. ""How many?"" I said I was getting up. Before I even got up, I said, ""How many people were killed?"" Because it was wall-to-wall people. And I said, ""How many people were killed?"" They said, ""We think three, sir."" And I said, ""That's not good."" And yet I must tell you it was like this, and this maniac was firing bullets all over the place. I heard them go right over my head, too. But it was just terrible. But I said, ""How many?"" They said, ""Three."" And then the two went and they had unbelievable talent in the form of doctors, two separate doctors, and they saved their lives. But Corey, Corey was hit bad, he was hit hard. He was hit hard. But I thought what I'd do-
CROWD: Corey! Corey! Corey!
TRUMP: One thing, and I didn't want to say it the other night, it wouldn't have been appropriate, but one thing nice, that we raised a little money for Corey. And you know what it ended up being? For his family, for his family, it's beautiful. I think around $5 million, right? 5 million? [cheers and applause] And a friend of mine, a pretty wealthy guy, he said, ""Do you mind if I give a check to the family of Corey?"" I said, "" You can do that if you want. How much?"" He said, ""A million dollars."" And he handed me a check for a million. And then they raised another $4 million. And we also gave some, or we were going to give some to the two gentlemen that got badly hurt, they got badly hurt. But we raised four and a half, $5 million for the family. So, I think it's good. And that's out of love for what they do. This is the greatest movement in the history of our country, and we have to take care of our people, right? [cheers and applause] We have to take care of our people. You know it is true. And look at all that fake news back there. I say that all the time. [booing]
And if I'm a little bit off with a statement, they say, ""Donald Trump, he lied, he lied, it was terrible."" Now you have Lying Kamala, she lies about everything, including where she worked, remember? ""I worked so hard at McDonald's, it was unbelievable. I stood over the French fries all summer, winter, fall, spring."" She never worked there, she lied. You know the beauty of that? They'll say, ""Oh, it's so terrible to bring that up, it's so simple."" No, David, the beauty of that, it's so simple. It's so easy to understand. She said she worked like a dog in McDonald's and it never happened. She didn't work there. That's better than some complex, long story that I have to, before we get to the fact that she's a no-good liar. But you know what's more important about her? I don't like her. You know what's more important about her? She's just led the worst rescue operation in history in North Carolina. [booing]
The worst. And we have another big one coming in. But the worst, the one in North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Virginia, it was pieces of Florida got hit. It's incredible. The worst ever, they say. They had no money. You know where they gave the money? To illegal immigrants coming in, many of whom are killers. [booing]
Many of whom are drug dealers, many of whom are gang members, and many of whom came out of prisons from all over the world. You know they come out of prisons all over the world, and they drop them in our country? And do you know that the prison population, all over the world, is down because they put them in our country? They come from the Congo in Africa. Many prisoners from the Congo. Welcome, everybody, welcome, it's lovely to have you. They come from the Congo, they come from the Middle East, they come from Asia, they come from all over the world. They also come from South America, but not as many as you think. A lot. But everyone thinks they come from a few countries in South. No, they're coming from all over the world. They're dumping them in our country, because they think we have stupid people leading our country. And on that, I agree with them.
Sleepy Joe. Although Joe's looking pretty good lately. I tell you, he's looking pretty good, compared to Kamala, I say, right? It's first time. I said, ""You know, this guy's starting to look sharper. He's starting to look sharper."" Because we're comparing it—And he's angry at her and he hates her. The only question is, I think he hates her almost as much as he hates me. No, and I think he might be willing to—He can't take much more. It was an overthrow, okay? It was an overthrow. And he's having a hard time saying he did it voluntarily. He didn't. They pulled out—You know what they did, right? Article what? 25. That's what they did. And they said, ""You're sick. You're not gonna go on."" He got 14 million votes. He got 14, think of it. He got 14, she got none. And this was an overthrow. This is the first overthrow, or you could call it a coup. Do you want to call it a coup?
CROWD: Coup!
TRUMP: This was the first coup in the history of America. David, you're an expert on this stuff, right? Wouldn't you say? First coup in the history of America.
But look, I say to all Pennsylvania patriots, we have to—I just said, do me a favor, you got to see this, because we had over 100,000 people in a beautiful area, but not exactly highly populated. They came from all over, 100,000 people on Saturday night. Take a look.
[video clip of ""Make America Great Again"" rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on October 5, 2024]
CROWD: We love Trump! We love Trump! We love Trump!
TRUMP: That's something, huh? Isn't that something? We have some very big ones coming. We have some very big ones coming. We just rented Madison Square Garden. [cheers and applause] We're going to make a play. We're going to make a play for New York. Hasn't been done in a long time. It hasn't been done in many decades, but we're going to make—How could New York be run worse than it is, right? With all the problem, everything is corrupt in New York, and we're going to make a play. And let's see. I think that the migrants have taken over Madison Avenue, they've taken over Fifth Avenue, they've taken over the parks. The kids can't play Little League. You know it sounds like a trivial thing. It's a big deal, when you have a son that's a Little League player and he can't play. So, we're going to go Madison Square Garden.
We went to the Coliseum, Nassau Coliseum. We could have filled up the Nassau Coliseum three times, it was incredible. We left there a few weeks ago, it was incredible. So, we're doing Madison Square. We're going to go the arena in Atlanta, if we can get it. We're going to go the arena in New Jersey, if we can get it. You have to get it. But we're doing arenas because the crowds are so big. And we're making a play for New Jersey, we're making a play for Virginia, we're making a play for New York, New Mexico, Minnesota, where this lunatic comes from. I'm doing well in—You know why I'm doing well in Minnesota? Because he's running. It's supposed to be the opposite way, right?
If Kamala Harris gets four more years, she will annihilate the Pennsylvania energy industry, plunging communities across the commonwealth into darkness and despair. [booing] That's what's going to happen. Your jobs will be down and your salaries will follow. Congratulations, everybody. It's not going to let it happen. We're not going to let her destroy—You know she destroyed San Francisco? We're not going to let her destroy this country. She shouldn't be here, we shouldn't be—How would you like to be me? We spent $150 million destroying Biden, which wasn't that hard, actually, all you had to do is hold up his record. But we had the debate. And then after the debate, he was down so much and they went to him, and that's when they went to him. So, we get rid of him. This is like a fighter. A fighter is doing badly, he's losing badly. And Dana White says, ""You know what I'll do? I'll put in another fighter to fight. You got to take two people."" And so now they put this total Marxist communist person in there.
But people have figured it out. She had a very bad day yesterday, and we're going to talk about that. She had a bad day. She had a bad day. Kamala Harris was one of the original sponsors of the socialist Green New Scam, you know that? Where they want to spend $93 billion, 93. No, they want to spend, actually, she's spending $93 billion and a short—But they actually, their ultimate plan, is for $94 trillion to be spent. 94, listen to this. That's more than China and the rest of the world could spend if they really wanted to in 25 years. 94 trillion. We're going to clean the air, so that when China comes here and takes us over, they'll have a nice, clear atmosphere, because that's what they're doing. They're sacrificing our military and everything else. These people are crazy. She said repeatedly that she wants to ban fracking, her whole life. ""We will ban fracking. We will stop."" [booing]
I flew over some of those beautiful windmills. They're falling down, by the way. They're all over the place. They're all over the place. That gorgeous, beautiful Pennsylvania countryside. They got these big, ugly suckers hanging down. They're rusting and rotting. Half of them weren't spinning. And the ones that were were going so slow, they were going, it's not too windy, but they're going slow. The other ones were just dead, but they're all rusting and disgusting-looking. And then the environmentalists say—It's also, very importantly, the most expensive form of energy there is. You cannot get more expensive than wind. The wind, it sounds so wonderful. The wind! The wind. The wind is bullshit, I'll tell you, it's horrible. [cheers and applause] So expensive. Just too expensive, it doesn't work. All of that to do one-tenth of 1%. The whole thing is crazy. You remember when I used to say, ""Darling, I want to watch our president tonight on television."" And the husband looks, ""I'm sorry, dear. The windmills aren't wind. There's no wind tonight. You can't watch, darling, we're not going to be watching tonight. Maybe we'll catch him another time.""
No, we have to be careful. We have to be smart. We're going to lose our country. These people are crazy. They're crazy. They're damn crazy. We're not going to, we are not. We are going to get out, we're going to vote. We'll get it cleaned up. But if we don't clean it up now, it's going to be too late. I really believe it. We don't clean it up now, it's going to be too late. She sponsored a bill to impose a 100% ban on gasoline-powered cars and trucks. You know that, right? [booing]
One hundred percent. There's none. There's none. Even though we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other nation, by far. More than Saudi Arabia, more than Russia. Let's go electric. Let's do this. They want to go, now, hydrogen. They want a hydrogen car. You know what the problem is? When they blow up. You are unrecognizable. If this beautiful young woman is in the car, driving, and the hydrogen car, if it blows up, you are unrecognized. You with the nice Trump sign. Is that Trump? Stand up, let me see. Oh, I like her. I like her. [cheers and applause] I will not allow her to go into a hydrogen car. They don't blow up that often. They were saying, ""Yeah, but they don't blow up that often."" Oh, great. Thank you very much.
And as we speak, Kamala is crushing Pennsylvania with a natural gas export ban. You know about that, right? Designed to choke the life out of your fossil fuel industry. Listen to Kamala, in her own words, very recently.
[start of video montage]
KAMALA HARRIS [montage of clips from Harris statements]: There's no question, I'm in favor of banning fracking. I'm committed to passing a Green New Deal, and finally putting an end to fracking once and for all. If they fail to act, as president of the United States, I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster to pass a Green New Deal. I am offering a Green New Deal that has been described as one of the most aggressive and progressive.
INTERVIEWER 1: He's going to bring the Green New Deal up for a vote.
HARRIS: Yeah, I will vote for it. It is a resolution. I believe that the underlying principles behind it are sound and important.
INTERVIEWER 2: What is the solution for voters who have jobs and interests in the fossil fuel industry?
HARRIS: Giving the workers an ability to transition into the jobs of the future.
INTERVIEWER 3: Can we afford it?
HARRIS: Of course we can afford it. It's not about a cost.
[booing]
NARRATOR: Kamala Harris pushed the far left Green New Deal. That means huge new taxes, increased utility bills, and banning gas cars.
HARRIS: That's why I'm committed to passing a Green New Deal, and finally putting an end to fracking once and for all.
JIMMY FALLON: Mamala Kamala just don't give a frack.
NARRATOR: Kamala's fracking ban would kill jobs and raise gas prices. Kamala doesn't give a frack about you. Only President Trump will bring back Trump's strong economy.
TRUMP: I'm Donald J. Trump, and I approve this message.
[end of video]
Thank you. So, when I'm president of the United States, and we did one great job. You know we did great in 2016, we actually did much better in 2020, but we're going to be very careful. We're not going to let that happen again. On day one, I will tell Pennsylvania energy workers to frack, frack, frack and drill, drill, drill. Drill, baby, drill. [cheers and applause] We're going to frack, frack, frack. We will have energy independence and energy dominance, as we did just four short years ago. We were energy independent four years ago, can you believe? Now we get our energy from Venezuela. What's that all about? From Venezuela, isn't that wonderful?
But if Kamala is re-elected, your course will go up and your lights will go out. That's what's going to happen. These stupid people. It's hard to believe. You know, you get angry because they just—Sometimes you get—And you want to be lighthearted, right? And we have a great audience, people that love the country, people that built the country. You've built the country and then you see these people, they want to destroy it. And by the end of your speech, you're furious. You're furious. Because all this stuff that we're saying, it's true. They want to destroy the country. Remember, she will never, ever let you frack. You're not going to frack. If she won, you're not going to frack. She's been against it her whole life. She just did this for an election.
Even now, Kamala's Green New Deal mandates regulations that are impossible, impossible to enforce. As an example, forcing power plants to shut down all across the country, more than 50 plants have recently been closed. So she took office and they are not going to be replaced. And you know, all you have to do with her is say all the things—""She's going to do this, she's going to do that."" Why the hell didn't you do it? Why didn't you do it? All of a sudden she likes walls. I built over 500 miles of wall. It kept us—We had the greatest border in history. Four years ago, we had the best border in our country's history. And that included human trafficking, mostly in women by the way. So when women say, ""Oh, I don't know if I like Trump,"" I was the one—That is the most heinous thing. Human trafficking, mostly in women. Gee, I wonder what that's all about, right?
And then they say, ""Oh, I don't know—"" Kamala's not going to protect anyone. They've allowed this country to be poisoned at our border. And a lot of people say—And this is not part of the deal, but I'd like to go off the teleprompter if you don't mind. [cheers and applause] I actually haven't—I don't think I've been on it yet. They're waiting for me. At some point, I'll be on it. But they're doing these things, nobody can understand it. It doesn't make sense, like men playing in women's sports, like open borders where criminals are allowed in. [booing] And literally by the time—I must be very good as a motivator because by the time I finish my speeches every time, I'm angry as hell because I can't believe what's happening to our country, what they're doing to our country.
Last year, Pennsylvania's largest coal-fired power plant shut down in Homer city, throwing hundreds and hundreds of workers out, just devastating. They got nothing. A small little community of 1800 people. Does anyone know where Homer is? Homer? Huh? Right? Stand up. Let me see you. Look at that. Are you a familiar—? Are you the man? I remember. That guy's become famous. Wow. Are you the guy right behind me? You're the guy that was looking—You're looking. You know the guy? Oh, I love this guy. What's your first name? What's your name? [cheers and applause]
This guy, he became more famous than me because—Okay, do we have time? Yes. To hell with these things, they're boring. Very boring. Now, this guy, he was the guy—No, I'm looking at him in the audience, I see him. But when the shots were fired, typically crowd control people, everyone flees. Now, in all fairness to the people sitting there, we had a tremendous, tremendous crowd that horrible day actually. Horrible day. But we had a tremendous crowd. He was behind me with a group of people, two, three times the size of this. It was bleachers, but 99% of the audience was out there. But this guy was standing up. So they say that when a shot is fired in a stadium like a soccer game, everyone—They call them stampede. They stampede, they get out, and a lot of people get killed. They get crushed, they get stepped on.
Nobody left, there with the big crowd or there but him. I mean, I don't want to say in particular because nobody left. Nobody left those stands. Normally—And there were a lot of shots being fired. There were eight shots being fired right over me. But what happened is we look back and it's such a famous thing now, and there's one guy that's standing. I didn't know you were going to be—And I didn't know he was going to be here. They gave you a good seat. They should give you a good seat. So listen to this. [cheers and applause]
Right. So this man, and he's back a few rows and next to a woman who was very brave too, and he's standing. He's not only not leaving, he's standing up and he's looking. He wants to find it because he knows—He saw a lot of blood all of a sudden, and he knew what happened, and all he cared about is, ""I want to get that guy."" But then our sniper took them out. And by the way, the local police too, they did a good job. Local police did a good job. [cheers and applause] But that guy, I said, ""There's a guy—"" ""David,"" I said, ""there's a guy I want in the foxhole."" We want him in the foxhole with me if we're ever in a foxhole because he stood up, he didn't care about the bullets. He was standing. All he wanted to do is find that guy. He said, ""There's a guy over there."" And you had some other people too. We appreciate it. Thank you very much. Great honor. Thank you. [cheers and applause] I love people like that. I love people like that. He's like a movie star. He has become a movie star, I'm telling you. We love him.
The head of the plant at Homer City said that Kamala's EPA had imposed a ""excessive economic and operational burden."" It wasn't possible to keep it open. It's being done on purpose. They're taking plants that are perfectly good, that are not polluting any more than anything else would, and they're closing them up and they're forcing you to use energy that's 10 times and 20 times more expensive and doesn't even work. One local businesswoman said that her life had been turned upside down by what happened, and a local union leader called the closure ""absolutely devastating and totally unnecessary."" And I hope whoever owns that plant can just keep it around for a few months, just keep going because we're going to let that plant go for a long time, okay?
So you got to tell them—Homer, Homer, you don't have long to go. I actually told the people in North Carolina who have been just devastated. I told them, I said, ""Look, just hang in for a few months."" It's tough to say. ""Hang in for a few months, but we take office on January 20th."" I said, ""Everything will be beautiful once I take office. Everything's going to—"" [cheers and applause] They spent all their funds. They have no funds to take care of—They have no funds. They have no workers. They have no nothing. FEMA, we had such a good FEMA. FEMA was great under Trump, that I can tell you. We had tremendous success. Under these demented and self-destructive Kamala Harris policies, Pennsylvania electricity prices are up 50% and are projected to rise by another 50% this year. So you're going to be up a hundred percent. Does anybody mind? No. You're making a contribution to the environment, right? Except you won't have any money left. You won't have a house left. You won't have a country left. You won't have a commonwealth left.
Even the grid operators themselves say that if the insanity continues, Kamala will crush the electrical grid of the United States of America. But we will not let her do it, will we? [cheers and applause] We're not going to let her do it. She's bad news. She doesn't even know where the hell she is. They ask her questions, she's like a vacuum, ""Huh? What?"" No, I don't want to be nice. Somebody said, ""You should be nicer. Women won't like it."" I said, ""I don't care."" They say that. [cheers and applause] A guy came up to me today. He said, ""Sir, you really should be nicer to her. The women won't like it."" The women want safety and the women want to have a country that they can be proud of, I think.
Anyway, so today I make Pennsylvania this promise. I will stop the energy price hikes, I will stop the plant closures immediately and we will restart the plants that Kamala has very cruelly closed. I mean, they don't know—They have thousands of jobs involved, people that have worked there for 25 years or longer, and we're not going to let it happen. I will terminate the Green New scam immediately. I want the cleanest water. You know, I don't know if you know, in my two last years we had the cleanest water we've ever had, we had the cleanest air we've ever had, and we had the most jobs and the most factories working that we've ever had. And the jobs they picked up were what are called bounce-back jobs. They were bounced back. They were the people that took off for the Covid, the gift—I call it the China virus because I want to be accurate and they bounced back.
I will end the destruction of our electrical grid. They're destroying our grid. It's already in bad shape, I'll tell you right now. But they are destroying—Isn't it amazing? We don't have any electricity, but they want to go all electric cars. Think of that. Now, think—I'm just thinking. We're talking about all electric and I love electric cars. You know why? Because I think Elon is great. [cheers and applause] But you know what? I like them for what the market is. There's a market—I think they're great. I think it's incredible. But the long distances and certain—And they're more expensive to make and a lot of them are going to be made in China. But you know the amazing thing about Elon Musk? He went to that rally. I think he had the greatest time he's ever had. Did you see it? He was jumping around. He was so happy.
He's always like—I envision him. He's sort of a reclusive kind of a guy. He's incredible. He's a total genius. We have to take care of our geniuses. But he comes up and he's looking at this crowd. He's never seen anything like it. And he started doing jumping jacks and stuff. No, he was just happy. I said, ""What's he doing back there?"" I would just give him a quick introduction. He had a great time and he got a black hat. I didn't even know we made black hats and it said, ""Make America Great Again."" But it was very low, very sort of understated, but a black hat. He loves that hat. And he called it Dark MAGA. [cheers and applause] Who thinks of this, Dark MAGA? And I called him, I told him, ""Thank you very much. We sold like 10,000 hats in the last two days."" I didn't even know we made that hat, now I find out it's like the hottest thing going, Dark MAGA. No, he's fantastic and he's going to do a lot. He's going to be involved.
He's great and he's going to be involved because we have so much fat in this country. We have so much waste and fat and fraud. But he's also—I will tell you—The funny thing with Elon, he never—With all I talk about electric cars and I'm totally for electric cars—Whatever the buyer wants to buy, that's good. But you can't force them down people's throats, you can't do that. Like the mandate. We're not doing mandates. So you can't do that. So just so you understand. So he never wants—And he's a friend of mine, he's great. He endorsed me. He endorses me so much, we have to get him—""We're going to lose our country if Trump—"" He's in Pennsylvania now campaigning, Elon Musk, because he feels so strongly. [cheers and applause] But you know the amazing thing?
A big company is Tesla. It makes great cars, really amazing cars. He never once said, ""Could you ease up on the electric thing?"" You would think he would've said, ""Hey, listen, do me a favor, could you?"" I could take it out pretty easily, right? It's a sentence. It's a sentence of the speech, but he never asked me to because I think he knows I'm right. He's going to do great. And there's people that like him. I like him too for certain applications, but he never thinks of it. And he's close to me. He never said, ""Do me one favor, just sort of lowkey—"" If I were him, I'd be saying, ""Hey, listen, Trump, do me a favor. Don't mention electric cars again, that you're going to do away—"" And we're not doing away. We're going to have whatever the market wants. We're going to have gasoline power. We're going to have hybrids. The hybrids are great. They're working good. We're going to have everything. We will make Pennsylvania an energy supplier to the entire world and I will cut your energy prices in half, 50%, five-oh, within 12 months of taking office. [cheers and applause]
Your prices will be cut in half. Now, she, on the other hand, if her mandate—You look, number one, you won't have any energy because they can't produce enough. No matter what they do, they can't produce under what she wants to do. But even if they did, your prices are going to be double, triple, quadruple. You're not going to be able to afford—I say we have more liquid gold than any country in the world. It's going to be so quick and so easy to do. We have more than Saudi Arabia. We have more than any country in the world, and we're going to take advantage of it if that's okay, and it's pure, sweet, beautiful stuff. But for that to happen, the people of Pennsylvania have to tell Kamala Harris that, ""We've had enough. We think you're a horrible person. We think you're a liar. And we hate—"" Right? ""We think you're a liar. We think you're not a smart person. And we're tired of having stupid people run our country."" [cheers and applause] And we're going to say, ""Kamala, you are fired. Get the hell out of here. Get out of here. Get the hell out.""
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Despite all of the devastation she's caused your Commonwealth, and she said yesterday she has no regrets. Did you see that? You'll see it in just about two seconds. Go ahead, put it on.
[start of video]
ANA NAVARRO: Well, if anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?
KAMALA HARRIS: There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of—And I've been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact.
[end of video]
[booing]
TRUMP: I think the other one asking the question is dumber than Kamala. So that's—She's a dummy. I watched her over the years. That is one dumb woman. Sorry. I'm sorry, women. She's a dummy. The only one that agrees with that more than me are the women in the audience. [cheers and applause] So think of this, what she said. ""No, I can't think of anything."" Did you see she froze? Did you see where her teleprompter went out? Her teleprompter went out and she said—It was 32 days or something before the election. So she said, ""Uh, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32."" She was freaked out. Thank God that sucker went back on—That would've been—I don't know what—She would've jumped off the stage. Now when you do this stuff, I would say probably 15, about 15% of the time, the teleprompters, they go out and either you—Can you imagine it goes out for Joe Biden? [laughing]
He's no good with the teleprompter blazing, right? No, it is gone out with him a couple of—You know what he does? He stops, looks around, and he walks off, but he can never find the stairs so it's a problem. He's looking around for stairs. Has anyone seen a stairway? We have more stairs than these platforms. I don't know what the hell it is. There must be a fire problem. There's like six stairs, and do you ever notice he can never find his way off the platform? Secret Service does a great job in that respect. They come up, they get him, they walk him off, but he looks better. I'm telling you. As I said, he looks better now than I've ever seen him looking. He's angry. He's angry at her. There's going to be an explosion before the election with them. Those two—There's going to be an explosion.
Did you see he held a news conference right in the middle of her one big event that she's had in about two weeks? He got up and held a news conference. He walked into the room—Nobody ever does it. He walked into the room and, ""This is a news conference, oh,"" and then he just died after that but it didn't matter. Can you believe that our country is being run by these people? Can you believe it? So she said she had no regrets. Everything great. She'd do the same thing as this guy, right? This really sad, pathetic guy. So after the surrender of our energy independence, the Afghanistan, horrible, most embarrassing moment in history, we lost 13 soldiers, great soldiers. We left billions and billions of dollars behind. We left Americans behind. You have Americans right now in Afghanistan, and they cannot be happy, right? They're probably—Many are probably dead.
The border invasion. The border invasion. How about the 13,099 illegal aliens convicted of murder? They're roaming free. That's okay. In other words, these are all things that are okay. These are all things that are okay. How about—? To me, the worst of all—Because it's not even imaginable. She's lost during her three and a half years 325,000 migrant children. They're gone. Nobody knows where they are. Many are dead. I would say most are dead. We don't know. We probably won't find out, but many are dead. Most are dead. Many are in sex slavery. Many are in slavery, but there are many dead. 325,000 young kids. Think of it. You could fill up Yankee Stadium many, many times. Think of that, many, many times. 325,000, they're gone. And the parents want them back. Nobody even talks about it. The fake news doesn't talk about. In terms of humanity, this is bigger than anything you can even imagine, right? This is the biggest thing. And she thinks it's okay because she said, ""No, I don't think I'd change anything."" All of this stuff would've stopped. The worst inflation in the history of our country costing everybody a minimum of $29,000 per family—Price hikes that cost a typical family—Think of that. No, she wouldn't change. $29,000, people don't have that money. The inflation has really destroyed the middle class. The elderly and people on fixed incomes are decimated. See, just think of it. Our middle class—How about Ukraine? If I were president, that never would've been a war. You wouldn't even know what Ukraine is. [cheers and applause] There would've never been a war. Putin wouldn't have done it. Putin wouldn't have done it, and that was okay with her. You remember what she said? She said, ""No—"" She didn't know where the hell she was.
She said, ""No, no, no, I'm fine. No, I wouldn't undone nothing."" How about the October 7th attack on Israel? [booing] That would've never happened. How about the fact that the United States is a laughing stock all over the world? How about she failed on the witch hunts against her political opponent, me? The first time that they've ever done that. They do it in other countries, like in Third World Banana Republics, the witch hunts. I call it the witch hunts against Trump. The one in Florida was thrown out, and yet Biden's document case, they ruled on him. They said he's guilty, right? Oh, he had documents for 50 years. He shouldn't, and I had—The Presidential Records Act. I was totally allowed to do it. Anyway, my case was won. He lost his case. What they said is that he's incompetent essentially.
They said he's got no memory and all sorts of other things, and therefore we shouldn't send him to court. They said he wasn't fit to stand trial, but he's allowed to be the President of the United States, okay? [booing] No, no. Think of that. Here's the ruling. He's not fit. He's got no memory and he's in trouble.
TRUMP: But he can run the presidency, but he cannot stand trial. They released him on the basis of that. The trillions of wasted dollars on the Green New Scam, all that money is not only wasted, it set us way back. Way, way back.
And the worst hurricane response since Katrina. She doesn't want to have a do-over with what's happened to North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, all the states that we just mentioned. Kamala Harris could not think of one thing that she would do differently. And you know, it's strange because when I saw that question, I said, ""Oh, this is going to be a long answer."" Because she could have done it in a nice way, ""I wish I would've done this on the border. I wish we would've closed up the border. I wish we didn't have the horrific acts of violence against all of those children."" And all of the things—And she could have really done—
And I said, ""Well, this will be a good answer."" She didn't know what the hell to say. But think of it, it was a soft ball question. And she said, ""No, I would've done everything—"" So, all of the agony, all of the suffering, all of the inflation and the border and the criminals coming into our country, she wouldn't have done anything different than this guy that should have really never been president, in my opinion, should have never been president.
So, she said that there'd be nothing. And to me, that is a disqualifying answer. That should disqualify her from even running. If that's going to be the case, she should be disqualified from even running. [cheers and applause] She's an incompetent person. She's grossly incompetent. She cannot be trusted. And she is totally ill-equipped to do the job of being president of the United States.
Let me tell you, I know all of them. I know President Xi, I know Putin, I know Kim Jong Un of North Korea. Biden, he said, ""Oh, that's a tough situation in North Korea."" We had no problem. I got along with him very good. A little rough start, right? Remember, little rocket man? Remember when he said, ""I have a red button on my desk""? That was a very threatening sound, ""I have a red button on my desk."" I said, ""I have a red button on mine too, but mine's much bigger and mine works."" [cheers and applause]
And then he called me and he asked for a meeting and we had a meeting. First time anyone's ever met—I said to Barack Hussein Obama—Has anyone ever heard of Barack Obama? Barack? Remember Rush Limbaugh? He used to go, ""Barack Hussein Obama. Barack Hussein Obama."" No. No. He told me that the toughest thing when we sit before—It's a beautiful thing, actually. The president sits with the new president coming in. He said, ""The biggest problem we have by far is North Korea."" We didn't have a problem with North Korea. Believe me. You may have in the future if you have stupid people running our country. But we had no problem. I met with him. It was a big deal that I met with him a second time. We were on our way to doing something fine. But he's got tremendous nuclear power. Somebody let him get there.
Our country just went through four years of really a horror show, and we cannot have four more years. We just had a man who's grossly incompetent as our president. And now we have a woman who is actually, in my opinion, worse than him. I believe she's worse than him. And we can't allow it to happen. Now, I had this done because our military is great. I knocked out ISIS. I knocked out ISIS. I knocked out ISIS. They said it would take four to five years. I did it in about a month, right? And we knocked them out.
General Raisin Kane, this is a tough guy. Our military is great, and they're not going woke. You could put them in a woke room and scream at them for two-and-a-half years, they'd walk out and they'd say, ""Let me at them."" These are not woke people. But I had this little clip and I thought you'd find it very interesting. It's the military of the past, let's call it the Trump military, compared to the very woke military that we have now. I think you'll get a kick out of it.

[cheers and applause]
TRUMP: So, it's a little exaggeration, probably really not that much actually, but what's happening to our country is—We have to preserve our country. Pennsylvania cannot let this woman become the president of the United States. She's the taxing queen. She's going to raise your taxes where you're going to be at least paying at least $3,000 a year more. Take a look.
[start of video montage]
KAMALA HARRIS: Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax bill. And on day one I will repeal that tax bill.
Joe Biden and I are about to work to get rid of that tax cut.
Joe and I are about to get rid of that tax bill.
Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax cut.
MEGHAN MCCAIN: . . . everything from a 70 to 80% tax rate.
HARRIS: I think that's fantastic. We've got to increase the corporate tax rate. Part of that is going to be about repealing that tax bill that they just passed. And also looking at estate tax are going to have to go up.
We will tax capital gains.
But we're going to have to raise corporate taxes.
UNNAMED COMMENTATOR 1: It's just a new way of looking at things to say, ""We're going to tax what you don't have."" That's a sore point and it's a big deal. Is that something you think she firmly believes in?
COMMENTATOR 2: I think it's part of the proposals of the campaign.
COMMENTATOR 3: Taxing unrealized gains just doesn't seem fair in any sense of the word.
COMMENTATOR 4: I think that this reaction to unrealized gains is a little funny given that I bet that the majority of people watching right now are already paying a tax on unrealized gains. It's called a property tax.
[crosstalk among commentators] Property tax.
When the value of your home goes up.
Property tax is a use tax. It's a use tax.
That's an old-
Because you're paying for schools.
When the value of your home goes up, you pay higher taxes. Even if you don't sell your home.
It's tiring.
Your value of your home never moves the way the stock moves.
Not the same.
The way something else moves that you don't-
It's always the go-to answer.
HARRIS: Under my plan, there will also be a carbon fee. There has to be some connection between the fee and bad behaviors. And there has to be—in that, we have to monitor whether it's going to be passed on to consumers. But I'm going to tell you that should never be the reason not to actually put a fee, in particular, a carbon fee.
NARRATOR: Kamala Harris is going to significantly raise taxes.
HARRIS: Taxes are going to have to go up.
NARRATOR: Kamala's plan will raise families taxes by nearly $2,600 a year. Under Kamala, prices have already soared. Now she'd make it worse with even higher taxes.
HARRIS: Taxes are going to have to go up.
NARRATOR: President Trump will cut taxes again. No taxes on tips, overtime, or Social Security.
TRUMP: I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message.
[end of video]
TRUMP: Yeah, we're going to cut your taxes. I've been involved in politics not that long on this side, but I've been involved. I've never seen anybody campaign on, ""We're going to raise your taxes."" That's what they're doing. The world has gone crazy. This guy. But David, we're going to cut taxes. Do you agree? David. David is going to win. [cheers and applause] You got to get him. You got to get him. I want him to come with me please. He's great. He'll be one of the best. A real hero.
Kamala will deliver a 1929 style depression, not recession. I will deliver lower taxes, lower regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates, low inflation and the greatest economy in the history of the world, which we had four years ago. We had that. We were going up—Nobody's ever seen anything like what we had. I was shaking hands with people. I said, ""How are you doing?"" ""We did great four years ago, five years ago. My company, I made all my money. And now we're not doing good."" Everybody said, ""We're not doing well. The taxes are too high. The interest rates, we can't borrow money at 10%."" They were at 2% with me. Now they're at 10%, but they're not really, because you can't get money at 10%. So, that means they're higher. 12. How about 13? How about 15? So, it means it's much higher. It's not 10%. You can't get the money. Nobody can get the money at 10%.
We will pass tax cuts for workers like you haven't seen before. And we will have no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great, great, great, great seniors. [cheers and applause] Right? No tax. Take a look at this comparison chart. There's nothing like a chart. It's actually not my favorite chart. I have another one that's much more of a favorite, but that's okay.
You see that? Look, it's ridiculous, the whole thing is. We shouldn't even have to campaign. This should be an automatic—To bring jobs back and factories back and wealth. All we want to do, we want to bring wealth back to Pennsylvania. We want to bring wealth back to our country. We will have a 15% made in America corporate tax rate. You know, I took it from 39% to 21%. Everyone said it couldn't be done.
By the way, Steve Moore was a great guy. Do you know who Steve Moore is? Great economist. He wrote a book The Trump Miracle. And the book is number one book, just one out. You know whose book is also number one? Melania. [cheers and applause] Her book is number one. Her book is number one. I got a call today. You know who called me? Bill O'Reilly. He called me. Bill O'Reilly. Do you know Bill O'Reilly? I like Bill O' Reilly. A good man. He's a good man. And he went through it. But he's very good and he's very good with books. He said, ""Yeah, Melania replaced me as number one on the list."" I said, ""That's the way to go."" But no, she did a great book. Yeah, go out and get that book. That's a good one. That's a good one. I think she treated me well, otherwise I wouldn't be talking about it, right? I would stay so far—I said, ""Do me a favor—"" I just wouldn't mention it, but now I do.
Cutting the tax from 21% to 15. So, we got it down to 21 and then I said, ""You know what? 21 makes us pretty competitive with the world."" Just so you know, our companies all trying to be stolen, and a lot of companies are lower than 21. So, I want to bring it lower. And I wanted to, originally—I got it down to 21. Everyone said that was impossible. Got it approved by Congress. But now I want to get it down to 15, but only for those companies that make their product in America. Isn't that a good idea? You make your product in America. In other words, you're creating jobs. [cheers and applause]
Think of that. Vivek, is that good? How about that? I got calls from very smart people like Vivek and they said, ""Where the hell did you ever come up with that idea?"" How simple is it? Your tax is going to go down from 21% all the way down to 15, which makes us just about the most competitive—I think there's very few—I mean, no great nation, no big nation—We get it all the way down. But you have to make your product here.
And I got a call from Wall Street geniuses, ""Who the hell gave you that idea? That's a great idea."" These guys, that's all they do is they think. Nobody ever thought about that. We're taking it down from 21 to 15. And then we have to do something very important. Those who don't make their product in America, and there are those that come in, like China and various others, they will be forced to pay stiff tariffs to—And remember this. This is a privilege. William McKinley. This is a privilege because it's a privilege of competing with our cherished companies.
So, we have companies, we have to protect them, and it's a privilege of stealing our jobs, our treasure, and our wealth. They're going to come in and they're going to have products, and they're stealing from us because they're taking our jobs, they're taking our companies, they're taking our wealth. And that's fine because they have to compete too. But now they're going to have to pay for it, and they'll have to pay and they'll pay hundreds of billions of dollars in pretty stiff tariffs. But what we're doing is we're preserving our companies, but we're doing something more important. They don't have to pay either, because all they have to do is build their plant in the United States of America and hire many of the people in this room. [cheers and applause] It's very simple. Right? David, are you on board? He's on board. Thank goodness. Thank goodness. If he said no, I don't know if I could have been so enthusiastic about you. No, it'll make us a rich country again. Right now we owe $35 trillion because of stupid stuff like this. And other countries, China in particular, they've done this for years and years and years. They built their country with money that we paid them. We're paying them $500 billion on average a year, for years. They built their military with our money.
So this will—We want them to do well. I want them to do well. I made a great deal with them. They have to buy $50 billion a year of product. I thought they said 50. ""My guys, I said, ""what's the number you want? 15?"" I said, ""15. Oh, good."" But I thought they said 50. So, they came to me and the deal was almost finished and it said 15. I said, ""What do you mean 15? You said 50."" They said, ""No, sir, we said 15."" I said, ""You didn't say—Make it 50. Go back to them, say, 'We made a mistake.'"" They went back and China accepted it. Can you believe it?
But I don't even talk about it because of COVID. I don't even mention it. We have USMCA. We did the deals with Japan, with South Korea. We were screwed by everybody, friend and foe. And the friends did a worse job on us than the enemies. The enemies were gentler to us than many of our friends on trade. But Japan, we redid that deal. We redid South Korea. We redid did a lot of deals. And we were respected.
You know, five years ago, we were a very respected country. And I don't want to say this too loudly because it could happen, but I don't fall down stairs. I don't fall on platforms. I don't fall off bicycles. [cheers and applause] I have a great memory. I can talk about hundreds of things at one time and always get back to that point that you were trying to make. I can do things that people can't do. But you know what? This is the most important period in the history of our country because our country, this is a nation in decline. We are a nation in decline. We're a failing nation. We're failing nation. And they have no clue what to do.
She wants to raise everybody's taxes. And what they do, today—They used to go to different states. If Pennsylvania was high, they'd go to another state, but now they go to different countries. Other countries want our business, they want our companies. And a lot of them have left. The pharmaceutical business left. A lot of industries have left. We're keeping them. And we're going to get all those people back. We're going to make it so they practically have to come back.
So, we'll take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and we're going to make our country so strong and so rich, it will never be so rich. [cheers and applause] We used to be an all-tariff country in the 1890s, 1880s, 1890s, early-1900s, all tariffs. That was when our country was the richest it ever was. It was never rich like that. It was so rich that they had to set up a commission, the great Tariff Commission of like 1887. It had one function, what to do with all the—We had so much money, we didn't know what to do with it. And then, in the 1900s, they brilliantly went to the income tax where everybody gets taxed and foreign companies could come in and just steal our treasure and our jobs, steal our wealth. And honestly, we've never really been the same.
The country made so much money and other countries lived. They were fine. But we're like taking care of the whole world and it's time for the world to take care of us. [cheers and applause] Does that make sense? Time to take care of us. And we're going to pay off debt, or we're going to reduce taxes still further because that's what it's all about. We gave you the tax cut and it was the biggest tax cut in American history. We gave you that tax cut. And our revenues were greater with a much smaller number. You paid much less. And yet, as a country, we did much more business. We had great years.
My pro-American trade policies are one of the major reasons why I've been overwhelmingly endorsed by the rank-and-file membership of the Teamsters Union. [cheers and applause] Including, oh, 65%, I got a 65% number from the Teamsters of Pennsylvania. Is anybody here from the Teamsters? I mean, where are they? I love them. Where are you? I heard that—Look at these guys. That's great. Thank you very much. [cheers and applause] That's great. That's great. Thank you.
Now, we got the firefighters endorse us. [cheers and applause] You probably heard they haven't—Oh. Wow. Look at that. That's a very good-looking group of human beings, I will say. That's a healthy-looking group.
CROWD: TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!
TRUMP: That's nice. That's nice. Thank you very much. Wow. I didn't know you'd be here. So, the firefighters, I guess, they haven't—Every year for what? 60, 70, some crazy number of years, they always automatically do the Democrats. And the rank-and-file said, ""We're not doing that."" And they voted overwhelmingly for me. And the union heads always have a problem with that. They always have a problem. [cheers and applause]
And the same thing happened with the Teamsters. And that's happening also with the auto industry because United Auto Workers, you're not going to have any jobs unless they vote. And if they vote for me, we'll have more autos being made in this country than at any time since the heyday, which was about 60 years ago, because all it is, is a one-way street out of our country. We're going to rebuild the auto industry in our country. We're going to make it so good and so powerful and so great again. [cheers and applause]
So, firefighters, thank you very much. We love you guys. That's good. Teamsters, thank you very much. [cheers and applause] Great people. No, that's great. See, they don't go necessarily by the heads. The heads. Although, I have to say the head of the Teamsters is a terrific guy, tough guy, good. He was fine with it. He was okay. He wants to go with what the people want. Sean O'Brien, he's a great, great guy. And I don't know as well, the firefighters, but as far as I'm concerned, he's a great guy. Has to be good. I like people that like me, don't we? I like people—If they like me, I like them. So, we're pleased. Thank you, fellas, very much. That's great. Any fires lately? Have you put out any fires lately? Any big bad ones? Huh? You guys have a lot of guts doing what you do, let me tell you.
We're pleased to be joined today by your next senator, Dave McCormick, and everybody is really, really impressed with Dave. [cheers and applause] I know him for a long time. Everything was the best. He was the best student. He went to the best schools. He went out in business, became one of the most successful guys, ran one of the biggest funds, and very successfully. I don't know. You sure you want to do this? I think I've talked a lot of people out of it. They see what I go through, you know? I had more investigations than Al Capone. He killed a person a week. Alphonse Capone, the meanest Scarface, the meanest of them all. I've been investigated more than Alphonse Capone ever even dreamed about. Of course, he used to kill the investigators. I don't do that. Do you want to come up for one second, David? Fast. Come on. Come on, David. Come on.
DAVID MCCORMICK: It's good to be here. Thank you. All right, well, thank you. Great to be in Scranton with the next President of the United States. [cheers and applause] President Trump, we're so honored to have you here, and we are committed in Pennsylvania to putting you back in the White House and changing the majority of the Senate and sending Bob Casey packing, so thank you for being here. What happens in Pennsylvania is going to—What happens for the country depends on what happens in the next 27 days. As you know, Mr. President, I was a wrestler, lots of wrestlers here in this part of Pennsylvania. And I wasn't the best wrestler, but I always knew in college, if I could get into the third period within a point or two, I would win. Because the third period is not about wrestling. It's about mental toughness. It's about heart. It's about staying on offense. It's about fight, fight, fight. Thank you, Mr. President.
TRUMP: Thank you, David. Callista? Are you Callista?
CROWD: FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
TRUMP: We have somebody else that I think is amazing. I had to compete with this guy and I thought it was going to be easy, but it wasn't. He was nasty. He was quick. He's smart as hell, and he knew things that a lot of people didn't know and didn't understand. He did amazingly well, because he started really as a rookie, and he got up and he wiped a lot of very smart politicians off the stage. [cheers and applause] And then one day he came up to me, he goes, ""You know? I don't think I'm going to beat you."" I said, ""You're not going to beat me. You're not going to beat me."" He's a great guy. He's really smart and I hope he's going to be involved in our administration. I do hope that. [cheers and applause] Because we can put him in charge of one of these big monsters and he'll do a better job than anybody you can think of. So, Vivek, please, thank you very much. Vivek is great guy. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Great job. Great job. No, he's tough. Tough and he's smart. Before I go to a couple of great, really, warriors, I want to introduce in a way another warrior, Callista. Callista, will you please stand up? Callista? Oh, you can stand up anyway. No, I'm only kidding. I know. I know you are, and I know. Thank you very much, thought, I appreciate it. Thank you very much, darling. Appreciate it. You look great. Thank you.
Congressional candidate, Rob Bresnahan. [cheers and applause] Rob, thank you. How's that going, Rob? Good. Thank you very much. County Commissioner, Chris Chermak, and Mayor. Thank you very much, Chris. Good job you're doing. Mayor Carl Curran. Thank you. Where's Carl? Thank you. He's here. I shook his hand a little while ago.
CROWD MEMBER: [inaudible].
TRUMP: Huh? Oh, oh. Hello. Thank you very much. Thank you for being here. Thank you very much, Mayor. I also want to send our love to everyone in Florida. They're going through a big one tonight. It's going to arrive tonight, sometime around midnight, a little before midnight, and we're praying for them and asking God to keep them all safe. All those people, I've never seen a hurricane like that. I don't know. So often they talk about it and they talk, talk, talk, because they want you to watch. This is the real deal. This is a bad one, and we have some great governors, great Republican governors that are in charge, and I think they'll do a phenomenal job. [cheers and applause] I think they're going to do a phenomenal job. But here are some facts. Kamala Harris is a radical left Marxist, rated even worse than crazy Bernie Sanders. Actually, rated even worse than Pocahontas. Has anyone heard of Pocahontas? She was an original creator of Defund the Police Movement and anybody who wants to defund the police for even one week is not worthy of being President of the United States. She was one of the originals, Defund the Police. We wanted to defund the police. You saw when she went up to Minnesota and she was bailing people out that wanted to burn down everything. Remember? They said, ""Oh, it's a friendly protest."" This poor, poor idiot from CNN News Stand, remember? He said, ""This is a friendly—"" Then he got hit in the leg with a rock or something, a hand grenade. He went down. Remember? He went down. He went down. This is a friendly protest. Oh, this is very friendly. And behind him the entire city of Minneapolis was burning. It looked like the Second World War. No, it was friendly.
That's a terrible thing, but she wanted to bail out all those people that did that and cause death. She wanted to get—She got a lot of them out. Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE. She wants mass amnesty for all illegals. She wants mass amnesty for people that have literally looked to destroy our country. It's all will go to one thing. It's going to bankrupt your Medicare, bankrupt your social security. We mention again, 325,000 migrant children dead or in slavery right now, and just plain missing. She was the attorney general of the state of California. She redefined child sex trafficking. These are words or phrases, ""assault with a deadly weapon"" and ""rape of an unconscious person"". She said, ""From now on, they will be called nonviolent crimes,"" and reduced sentences accordingly. [booing] She pledged to confiscate your gun. She's going to take away your guns. I didn't let anybody touch that. Not an easy issue. I didn't let anybody—Does anybody in the room, please raise your hand, have a gun? [cheers and applause]
That's a tough job. She wants to confiscate your guns and endorse a total ban of handgun ownership. What do you do when a bad guy comes into your house? What do you do? A bad guy walks in and he's got whichever gun you have. If you don't have a gun, you're in big trouble, right? I mean, you need to have—That's what they have the Second Amendment for. You know, the city with the strongest—The city with the strongest gun legislation, ""You can't have a gun. You can't get near it. You go to jail forever."" It's a place called Chicago, and that's got the worst problem, right? That's got the worst problem. She even called for free sex changes for illegal aliens in detention. [booing] All paid for by the taxpayer. In other words, if you're being detained and you want a sex change, you can get—By the way, aside from the obvious, not such a great idea. It's a very, very expensive operation. And perhaps most revealing of all, she lied all about so many different things, but she lied about that little thing called McDonald's. She never worked there. And yesterday, Tampon Tim said—You know why they call them that? Because they sell tampons with special legislation in boys' locker rooms. Can you believe it? Says he's a freak. I'm not allowed to say that. I'm not allowed to say that. By the way, can you imagine if this guy happened along, right? Can you even believe this? And yesterday, Tampon Tim said they want to abolish the Electoral College, taking away all electoral power basically from the voters of places like Pennsylvania. Tim and comrade Kamala are really a true threat. They are a true threat to democracy. I'm not a threat to democracy. I'm the one that's going to save democracy. I'm the one that's going to save it. [cheers and applause] I'm going to save democracy. They are a threat to democracy and they really are too. Also, a big thing that's a threat is incompetence, is a threat to democracy. It really is. Because much of the stuff they do, I think, is incompetence. But she's surrounded by very smart, very vicious people that have to be—that are very radical left lunatics, okay? But they are smart. In some cases, genius. Look what they could do with elections. Look what they do. They're smart and we have to be very careful. I talk about the enemy from within. They're the enemy from within. We have the enemy on the outside and the enemy from within and the enemy—
Let's say you talk China, Russia, North Korea. You talk about different places. If you have a smart president, that's not going to be a problem. But the enemy from within is a very sick group of people. I can tell you because I had to go through years of, ""Russia, Russia, Russia,"" and they knew it was fake. They knew it was fake. How about this? I have a son, Don, who's a great guy. He knew less about Russia. He knew less about Russia, David, than—There's nobody in this room. Is there a child in the room? A child? Is there a young child? Huh? No, he's not that young man. He's about 70 years old. She's pointing to a guy that's like in his—Where is—yeah.
Okay, so you take a child. You take a child who's five years old. He knows more about Russia than my son. He knew nothing, and yet Adam shifty Schiff came out of an intelligence hearing, and he said, ""Donald Trump Jr. will go to jail for what he did with Russia."" Just understand, the whole thing was a made-up scam by him and crooked Hillary and all these people. It was a scam.
It turned out to be—and the writers at the New York Times got Pulitzer Prizes for their excellent journalism. No, but the thing turned out to be a scam. And then they admitted they were wrong. And we're suing the Pulitzer Foundation. We're saying, we're demanding that they retract the Pulitzer Prizes, with damages, and we're doing very well in that case. But think of it. Think of it. He knows nothing about—and I call him. I say, ""Are you okay?"" He said, ""Yeah, dad, I know nothing about what they're talking about. I have nothing to do with Russia. Absolutely."" Here's a sleazebag that goes out and says my son is going to go to jail on a con job that he made up along with Hillary and some of the others. Now think of it. How bad do you have to be to do that?
He knows it's a phony story. They got caught and now they've all admitted it was a con, it was a hoax, as we said, a scam, and they tell me my son's going to go to jail, and they all know it's a hoax. These are sick people. These are bad people, and we got to beat them and we got to beat them badly, and we got to get them the hell out of there. We're going to get them out. [cheers and applause] With your vote this November, we're going to defeat these radical-left lunatics, and we're going to finish the job that we so brilliantly started. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. Think of it, what we had going. On day one, I will seal the border. I will stop the migrant invasion, and we will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country. [cheers and applause]
I don't want to do that. I have a heart. I have a bigger heart than most of the people in this room, let me tell you, but you have no choice. It's not—it's not sustainable. We have to get them out, and we start with the worst of the criminals. We start with the drug lords. We start with the worst of the criminals. The illegal migrants coming into our country are taking the jobs of American citizens, the Black and Hispanic communities in particular; the Black communities, the Hispanic communities, and the unions are coming next. You watch. They're going to go after the unions. They're doing it and they're here, and they shouldn't be here. I will end inflation, and I will make America affordable again. [cheers and applause]
I will fight for and protect social security and Medicare. There'll be no cuts. There'll be no cuts, and we won't be raising the age like they're going to end up doing. They'll be raising social security by five or six years. You watch. Very soon. Very soon they're going to do it because it's not sustainable what they're doing. We will terminate Kamala's insane electric vehicle mandate. I will stop outsourcing and turn the U.S. into a manufacturing superpower. Working with Elon Musk, we will slash a record amount of government waste. [cheers and applause] I will end the war in Ukraine, stop the chaos in the Middle East, and prevent World War III. We will prevent World War III. [cheers and applause]
I will crush the violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources, and the respect that they so dearly deserve. Our police are great. We're going to give them back their authority. It's been taken away. They destroy our police. They take away their house, their family, their car. They take away their pension. They want to do their job. We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington D.C., making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. I will support universal school choice. [cheers and applause] We will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools immediately, and we will keep men out of women's sports. [cheers and applause]
I will defend the Second Amendment, protect religious liberty and restore free speech, and we will secure finally our elections. We will secure them. Everyone will prosper. Every family will thrive and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda once and for all. [cheers and applause] We want a landslide that is too big to rig. We want to have it too big to rig. Early voting is underway. Get everyone you know and vote, vote, vote. Get out there and vote. After all we've been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of our country. With your help now until election day, this is such an important little period of time. We will redeem America's promise. We will put America first, and we will take back the nation that we all love. We love our nation. [cheers and applause]
As an example, I didn't need this. I could be in the most beautiful beach in the world right now. Instead, I'm in the Commonwealth, which is okay with me. I like this better. A lot of people are in the beach. No, this is much better and much more important. It has nothing to do with like. November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country, and together we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. [cheers and applause] We will make America proud again. And we will Make America Great Again. [cheers and applause] Thank you very much everybody. God bless you. God bless you all. Thank you. Get out and vote. God bless you.

    ANNOUNCER: Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome the next President of the United States, President Donald J. Trump! [cheers and applause]
[music: Lee Greenwood, ""God Bless the USA"".]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Ahh, this is some crowd. What a group. I know so many of the people, all these people. They're tough as hell. They're from Georgia, they should be tough. [cheers] I want to just say a special hello to Georgie. You have a lot of excitement going on outside. You know that, right? Right, Kelly? We have a lot of excitement going on outside. We're doing very well, they tell me, but one day is not too much, but looks like we're doing pretty well.
What do you think? [cheers and applause] Congressman Barry, huh? I hear we're doing well. I'm thrilled to be back in the incredible state with thousands of proud hardworking American patriots, which is what you are. You are hard workers and it's going to pay off.
We're going to take back our country. We're going to turn it around so fast. [cheers and applause] Before we begin, I want to send our love and prayers to everyone here in Georgia hit by the hurricanes. You got hit hard. As well as Florida, North Carolina, they really got hit hard. South Carolina got hit pretty hard. Virginia, Alabama, and Tennessee. That's a lot of hurricane. That was a big hurricane. I thought we were over.
[speaking to crowd member] Yeah, that's Trump country, you're right. It's Trump country. It is indeed. We love it. We love the people. [cheers and applause]
We wish they took better care of Trump country, right? Our hearts are with the families of every citizen who is tragically lost and all of the people who lost their home.
A lot of homes were lost too. A lot of people were lost. The citizens of Georgia are tough and resilient, and this state is going to come back stronger than ever. We're going to make sure it comes back stronger than ever. And I want to thank you, Governor Brian Kemp—[cheers and applause] he's done a really good job, and his staff for the work he's done and they've done. And God bless you all. Despite the storm, early mail-in voting in your state is now underway and early in-person is underway. But I'll tell you what, I'm hearing very good things now. It hasn't been going on too long, but we're seeing numbers. They're saying, ""Wow, those are big numbers.""
In fact, they set a record for the number of ballots today, right? A number, right? [cheers and applause] So if you have a ballot, return it immediately. If not, go tomorrow. As soon as you can, go to the polls and vote. Then for the next 21 days, get everyone you know to get out and vote.
We don't want to take a chance. We can't lose this country. If we're not successful, we're going to lose our country.
From the very beginning of this journey, I've been on a mission to rescue our nation from a failed and corrupt political establishment. And are they corrupt? [cheers]
$500,000 for a painting. That's not good, is it, huh? I said, ""Well, that one, they'll never get away with, Byron."" I said, ""No way."" How did Byron do? Did he do a good job of it? [applause]
Great. Great guy. Stand up, Byron. Big star. Barry, he's gonna be—he's gonna be, be a big star, this guy. Do I have him right? He's going to be a big, big—He already is a big star, if you get right down to it.
Thank you very much. Good job. I heard every word. I was taking pictures. I said, ""Well, that guy's doing a good job.""
And to give you back the country that you believe in, the country you were born in, and the country that you deserve, that's what you want. Everywhere you look, under Kamala Harris, the American standard of living is in a free fall. Nothing works. Have you ever noticed nothing works? It's like everything they touch turns to—uh I won't say it.
No, everything they touch, including their rescue plan, which they didn't even have a plan. You're working more hours for less money to afford smaller houses, worse cars, fewer groceries with absolutely nothing left to save. Our schools don't teach. Our cities aren't safe. Illegal aliens are pouring in by the millions and millions and millions, and we're teetering on the brink of World War III. Other than that, I think we're doing quite well.
Kelly's saying, ""Man, this is really depressing.""
But exactly three week—and uh look, we're down to the wire now, wouldn't you think, huh? Three weeks from tonight, the people of Georgia are going to end Kamala Harris's reign of failure. [cheers and applause]
And we are going to launch a new golden age of American success for the citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. It's going to be a golden time. And I wanna congratulate—I want to thank a man named Elon Musk because he did a big favor. [cheers and applause] He did. When I was down here, early on, I was down and we were with the folks and they were going, ""Sir, we need Starlink."" I said, ""What the hell is Starlink?"" He said, ""Do you know Elon Musk is the most incredible thing."" Because, specially in North Carolina, they had no communication whatsoever. Right, Barry? They were just wiped out and they had no communication and it's hard to get. It's hard to get, so I called up Elon and he endorsed me.
He gave me the greatest endorsement. And how about that rocket, the way it came in yesterday? Was that crazy? [applause] Was that crazy? I was on the phone with somebody and I have the television on, no sound or anything, and I'm looking at the screen, but I'm talking to somebody, I guess couldn't have been that interesting a person. [laughter] And I'm watching the screen and this big monster, the thing's like 20 stories tall, and it's coming down, the fires pouring out of it from all angles. And I say, ""I don't know. Could you hold on a minute? There's something happening on—I've never seen anything like this."" Brandon.
The great Brandon Beach. Does everybody know Brandon? Great. Thank you, Brandon. What a good patriot he is. But I said, ""I've never seen anything like this.""
So it's coming down, down, down. And I said, ""Oh, man, it's going to be terrible. It's going to hit the gantry,"" or whatever they call it, ""It's going to hit. It's going to knock it over."" Marjorie Taylor Greene, it's going to knock it over. It's going to knock it on its ass like you knock your competitors on their ass, Marjorie. [cheers and applause] Right? And she is highly respected, let me tell you. Smart.
So, it's coming down and I didn't like the angle. I said, ""Come on, baby."" And then all of a sudden you see the fire pouring from the right side. It's strange. Boom. I mean the thing—and I said, ""That was amazing."" And I forgot the guy that was on the phone. They have a certain respect where we're leading everybody, so they hold on forever. You know, they would've—Doug, they would've held on for an hour, but I just totally forgot because I've never seen anything—
I said, ""Elon, could you do me a favor? Starlink."" ""Yes. What would you like about it?"" I said, ""They need hundreds of them in North Carolina and also in Georgia. They really want them in Georgia too because they lost their wires. They're down."" And I'm talking to him. And as I'm talking, I get a call from somebody in North Carolina, ""Thank you for the Starlink."" And I said, ""How the hell did you do that?"" [cheers and applause]
No, it's true. Elon, he's different. No, he's different. I said, ""Elon, I don't know what Starlink is, but they like it, they like it."" But no, it was funny because I'm on the phone and it's all done. And I'll tell you what, it got here and it was delayed once it got here.
Bad things happened. You know it's happened with a lot of people, but ultimately, they got it. And I said, ""How does it compare to the lines?"" They said, ""It's better."" And the guy just is a fantastic guy. So we want to thank him for his big endorsement. And he really is—and you know where he is right now? He's in Pennsylvania campaigning for me. Is that great? [cheers and applause] He's in Pennsylvania campaigning. And we were in Butler, Pennsylvania honoring Corey, the firefighter who lost his life. Two other good guys, by the way. Two other very good guys, but he lost his life. And Elon was there and he wore the black hat. I did not know we had a black hat. It's black with black letters, okay?
And he called it dark MAGA. And he hasn't taken it off. And he loves that hat. No, but we want to thank him. He's been really great. He's a great patriot. He's a brilliant guy too. I said, ""Does anybody else do that with the rockets because I've been watching this stuff for a long time?"" Byron, have you ever seen that before? I said, ""Can the Russians do it?"" ""No."" ""Can NASA do it?"" ""No."" ""Can anybody do it?"" ""No, only me."" I said, ""Keep it going, man. That's pretty cool."" [laughter] It's the coolest thing I've seen in a long time. [applause] Pretty cool. We got to protect our brilliant people. We got to remember that. There aren't too many brilliant people around.
Not too many, right, Marjorie? Marjorie knows better than anybody. There aren't too many.
Oh, you're Lieutenant Governor is right there. Look at this. We have big power, huh? Thank you, both. [applause]
With your vote, we will create millions of new great-paying jobs, wages will soar, your taxes—your taxes are going to fall. You saw that? Your net worth will skyrocket. America will be confident again. You know America has lost its confidence. It's a terrible thing to say. I said it one time and I said, ""You know it's actually true."" But it's going to come back very quickly. America will be respected again. The American people will be optimistic again and you will be proud of the life and the future you are going to give and giving to your children. Our legacy will be nothing less than the rebirth of the American dream.
You don't hear about the American dream anymore. You don't hear about—we used to hear about the American dream. My father used to say, ""You want to live the American Dream, son."" And I said, ""What's the American dream, Dad?"" And I didn't quite make it. I wanted to make it. [laughter] Now, I could have the American dream. You know what? I had the American dream. Did I need this? But I wouldn't swap it. I wouldn't swap it, Byron.
I was saying yesterday, ""I could be on the waters of Monte Carlo. I could be all over the world enjoying myself, but I'd much rather be right here with you."" It's true because we have a mission. We have a mission. And we don't have a choice. You know we really don't have a choice.
Somebody said, ""Why are you doing this?"" I said, ""Because we don't have a choice. We're going to make America great again. What's better than that?""
I have a lot of rich friends. They go here, they go there. They're boring as hell. Nobody cares. They put on their bathing suit. They don't look a lot better than Biden, except they have fancier beaches, right?
And look what we're doing. We're doing something. If we win this election, it will be the greatest event, political event or otherwise, in the history of our country. [cheers and applause]
And we're going to turn it around fast. It's going to go very quickly. We're going to turn it around fast. Kamala is turning us into a third-world nation, which is true. [booing]
You know, I didn't know she didn't pass her bar exam. Did you know that?
I'm just—I'm hearing this. I don't want to tell you about it. Please, I don't want to. I don't wanna mention. I will not mention the fact that she didn't pass her bar exam, so I'm not going to mention that.
But with our victory, we'll become the greatest, strongest, freest, safest, and the most powerful nation the world has ever seen. We're going to put it back together fast. [cheers and applause]
Four years ago we were respected, now they laugh at us. Other countries laugh at us. I had a good interview today with Bloomberg. Did anybody see that? That was a great interview. He was a Trump hater and brilliantly, my staff didn't tell me that. I said, ""Who is this guy?"" ""Sir, he hates you very much. He's been after you."" So they got me all started before I went up, but it was a great interview. And I think it really showed the plan that we have because he was unable to dispute it. We're going to bring so many companies back into our country, and a lot of them are going to be based right here, right in the great state of Georgia. There's going to be a lot of things happening. It's going to happen very fast.
Remember, I used to say, ""We're winning too much""? You're going to say to me, Marjorie is going to come with the Lieutenant Governor and Doug and Kelly's going to be there. Got a lot of cash, I'll tell you. [laughter] And Loudermilk, he's coming in with this beautiful family.
And you're going to be begging me. You're going to be saying, ""Please, sir, there are too many companies coming into Georgia. Please, we can't take it anymore. We don't have enough people for the jobs. [cheers and applause] Please, we don't want any more companies. We don't want any companies."" That was the takeoff on the winning. We're going to win so much. You're going to come, ""Please, sir, we can't win anymore. We're winning too much."" We had a lot of fun. And we had a lot of fun.
We have a new one now. All those companies are going to be pouring in.
But starting on day one, I will quickly defeat inflation and we're going to bring down the energy prices fast. Liquid gold. And we will make America affordable again.
Prices are still going up. They're going up again, and they surged again very viciously last month. And here we go again. And Kamala Harris—she has no idea what's happening. They say, ""What do you think of inflation?"" ""What?"" ""What do you think of inflation?"" ""Huh?""
She didn't know what the hell they were talking about. Other than that, she just got it right under toe, right? She didn't really know what they were talking about when they said inflation. ""What is it?""
Kamala Harris has developed a policy. You know what her plan is called? I have no plan to fix it—that's what. She says, ""I have no plan to fix it."" She's changed 15 policies. You know on occasion, somebody will run and change one, like they'll be for the death penalty or not for the—
She's changed 15 policies. No fracking, no this. Every single thing she's changed. Go back a year and a half and take a look, 15 policies. I've never seen anyone get away with one major change. The whole thing is different.
She loves walls now. She loves walls. [laughter] She loves our police, but she was in charge of defund the police. Do you go from a defunder of the police? I don't think so. Lieutenant Governor, from— do you go from a defunder? She was a leader of defund the police. And now she says, ""I love the police."" In the meantime, every police group in the nation is supporting me. [cheers and applause]
And the Border Patrol came out. Did you see that? The Border Patrol came out. [cheers and applause]
Thousands and thousands of them came out. Two nights ago when they endorsed Trump, they said, ""We endorse—"" Paul gave a beautiful speech. Incredible people. I know them all very well. They never met her. They never spoke to her. They were asked, ""Did you ever get a call from anybody in Border Patrol?"" ""Yes."" ""Did you ever call them back?"" ""No."" They never once spoke to anybody even in authority or not authority, nobody, they never spoke.
And here we have the biggest travesty. I believe it's a bigger problem because of the murderers and everything else coming into it. I believe, look, inflation and the economy are always big. And they're big, what they've done to our economy. But I really believe that the border and the illegal immigration and 21 million people, many of them criminals, is a bigger thing than inflation. [cheers]
I may be wrong. I may be wrong, but I think so. [applause] It's rated number three after the economy and inflation. I put them sort of together, economy, inflation. I think they sort of belong together. What do you think? I think so.
But I think the biggest thing is when you have 13099 murderers, people that are—four people that were ready for to be executed, they said rather than executing them we'll let them come into America. 13099, many of them, many of them killed more than one person. And they're happily ensconced in Georgia. They're all over the country. And these are killers. These are people that will kill you quickly. They don't need too much of an excuse. They have, as they say—they have as they say, a short fuse. Uh you don't want to get into a little tiny argument that for somebody else would be an argument for them, it's not good, right? It's not a good situation for you.
We don't want them in this country. We're getting them out of this country fast. Fast. [cheers and applause] And I think it's a bigger I think it's bigger than the economy. I think it's bigger, it's horrible. Inflation is a country buster. It's busted many countries, but I think it's bigger than inflation, even. Over the past four years, her inflation nightmares cost the typical family $29000.
Think of that, $29000 in inflation. The reason you feel poorer is thanks to Kamala. And that's the fact is you are. And she was the one, they called her the taxing queen in San, you know she destroyed San Francisco. San Francisco, if you go back 18, 19 years ago, it was the number-one city. It was the best city in the country. Now it's not even livable. And I speak against myself.
You know I own property in San Francisco. I own a lot of property. I own property in California. And every time I say this, I say, I'm saying, please don't say it in my—please because every time I say it, I depreciate the value of my property. [laughter] Guys that would've said, I love that place you have and I own on the water the most gorgeous things right on the ocean. I always say I have the ocean.
Pebble Beach only has the bay. That's in my head. And I never even need it because it's always full. But I have the ocean. Pebble Beach has the bay. The truth is, every time I speak this way, I hurt the value of my properties. But ultimately I don't give a damn cause this is much more important. [applause]
She destroyed—along with Gavin Newsom, the governor, Gavin Newsom, they destroyed, the two of them, what she did to San Francisco. And then she became Attorney General. What she did to California is a disgrace. And now she wants to do that to the United States of America. We're not going to let that happen, Marjorie, [booing] her plan will raise taxes for the typical American family by an estimated $3000. Take a look at this.

CLIP : [TAX CUTS AND INCREASES]
VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax bill.
UNNAMED INTERVIEWERS: Calling for a full repeal of President Trump's tax cuts if Kamala Harris was elected president, there are many different tax policies which could cripple the economy, but the first thing she wants to do is allow these Trump tax cuts to expire. Even the New York Times admits that 85% of the middle class got a tax cut. Americans will face a hike. The Tax Foundation finding that a couple with two kids making $165,000 a year would have to pay over $2,400 more in taxes.
HARRIS: And on day one, I will repeal that tax bill. Joe Biden and I are about to work to get rid of that tax cut. Joe and I are about to get rid of that tax bill. Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax cut.
UNNAMED INTERVIEWER: Everything from a 70 to 80% tax rate.
HARRIS: I think that's fantastic. We've got to increase the corporate tax rate. Part of that is going to be about repealing that tax bill that they just passed, and also looking at estate taxes are going to have to go up. We will tax capital gains. But we're going to have to raise corporate taxes.
[crosstalk among unnamed commentators]: Taxing unrealized gains just doesn't seem fair in any sense of the word.
Because you're paying for schools.
When the value of your home goes up, you pay higher taxes even if you don't sell your home.
It's tiring.
Your value of your home never moves the way the stock moves to say, ""We're going to tax what you don't have."" That's a sore point and it's a big deal. Is that something you think she firmly believes in?
I think it's part of the proposals of the campaign.
HARRIS: Under my plan, there will also be a carbon fee. There has to be some connection between the fee and bad behaviors, and there has to be, in that we have to monitor whether it's going to be passed on to consumers. But I'm going to tell you that should never be the reason not to actually put a fee, and in particular a carbon fee. [booing]
NARRATOR: Don't let Kamala Harris fool you. Harris not only supports taxing service workers' tips, news reports confirm Biden and Harris have weaponized the IRS to confiscate your tip money. Harris and Biden have literally unleashed the IRS to harass workers who receive tips and they just may be coming to your house next. Only President Trump has a plan that ends all taxes on service workers' tips. President Trump, he's on your side.
TRUMP: I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message.
[cheers and applause]
TRUMP: You know, the only problem with putting it up, the fake news and there's a lot of them back there, [booing] so I have a lot of friends, no, I have a lot of friends, they watch the rallies on television. This isn't a rally, this is just a get-together. Look at it all the way up to the bleachers. [cheers and applause]
But they watch. Hello up there. It's a nice place. But they watch, a friend of mine goes, he says the only problem is when you put up the videos, they don't show it on television. You know why? Because they don't want to move the camera a little bit up? They don't want to because they don't want do anything that's good for us. They don't want to do anything that's good for us.
And you know what? They ought to be ashamed of themselves. I'm going to ask them to put on woke—Do you know what this is all about? We don't have a woke military, but some people think there are some people in the top. Can you put that woke military, put it up, the master sergeant.

TRUMP: So we won two beautiful, big, horrible in many ways, but we won two world wars with that attitude. And uh we didn't win with the woke stuff. But our military is not woke. We have some people on the top that are woke. They'll be gone so fast your head will spin. Okay? [cheers and applause]
Under the Trump administration, we will put more money in your pocket. We will let you keep more money than you ever thought possible. We're bringing it down. We're bringing the costs down. We will have large tax cuts for workers and we are going to have something very special. No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on social security benefits for our seniors. [cheers and applause]
That's a big one. And you deserve it. You know what, you put up with inflation for the last two and a half years, that shouldn't have ever been here, would've never been here. Think of it. We wouldn't have had the war with Russia and Ukraine. No way Russia would've done it. We wouldn't have had—you wouldn't have had October 7th with Israel. You wouldn't have had inflation.
You wouldn't have had that horrible, most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan, the way they withdrew. We were going to withdraw. But we're also going to keep Bagram, the biggest military base in the world. We gave it to China. You know who has it now? China has it one hour away from where they make their nuclear weapons.
And on that day we lost 13 great soldiers and many were obliterated. No arms, no legs. The face was just disastrous. What these people—nobody ever mentions them, but we had a lot of people badly, badly hurt. And what a shame. What a shame to see what's happened to our country, the border, all of the things that we've suffered in the last almost four years. We're going to get it back so fast. We're going to be proud again. We're going to be very proud of our country. [cheers and applause]
Isn't it nice to have a president that doesn't need a teleprompter? What do you think, Byron? It's better, right? [cheers and applause] Huh? Did you see when her teleprompter crashed last? She was talking about 32 days, Mr. Congressman 32. She goes, and the election will be in 32 days. 32 days. The teleprompter crashed. 32 days. She kept going. I would've loved to—you know it kicked back in. It's called a kickback. Like some people know a lot about a kickback. It's called a kickback. They know in this administration. But no, it's a kickback. It kicks back in and it did kick back in just in time because she was about ready to eat the—Byron goes, yeah, this was—when you do this, you have to have one ability. If the teleprompter goes, because it goes, I figured 5% of the time it goes, it's gone.
And you're standing up in front all of the fake news, which is actually a much bigger audience than this because you've got millions of people watching. So you're standing in front of the fake news with fake reporters and you know some very bad, and some good ones and some good ones. I'd say 5%, right? What do you think, Byron? 5%? I think so. 5%, maybe less.
But, and if that happens, and if you don't do this well, you are ridiculed the following day, right? And I've had to go off with Bernie Marino in Ohio, I was doing very well, but I had 57000 people out there, television blazing. And he's going for the nomination and it wasn't looking good. The wind was blowing at 49 miles an hour.
And I got onto the stage and I'm looking at these two things and they were like [Trump waves hands to represent wind]—so you can't read them. But I said, ""Don't worry about that. They're going to blow off."" And within the first minute they blew off the stage. They were like 30 yards down the road. And I'm standing there. And that's when you find out whether or not you have what it takes, right? [cheers and applause] You're up there all by yourself. You're up there all by yourself, Mr. lieutenant governor, and you better get going.
And you can't do that 32 stuff that she was doing. Why? Why did he have to fix that damn teleprompter? But it is true. I have a friend, he just wants to go into politics, but he's petrified of, he said, ""I have one phobia."" He's a very smart guy, very rich guy. He wants so much to be in politics. I said, ""Do you have any problems?"" Well, I have a problem with—I have a phobia against public speaking. I said, ""Don't go into politics. If you have that phobia, I would not bother.""
Right? What do you think Byron? No good, right? He wouldn't come up and warm up the crowd like you did. He'd stand there, get me off.
To crush inflation we will quickly become energy independent and we will frack, frack, frack, and drill baby, drill. She won't frack. She's not going to frack.
She's not going to frack. Pennsylvania, please. Pennsylvania. Remember, she's not fracking. Her whole life is, we will not frack. We will not frack. She's gone through a whole life like this. All of a sudden, oh, I look forward to fracking. No it doesn't.
I will cut your energy prices in half within 12 months. You're going to get them in half, 50% in 12 months because we have liquid gold. [cheers and applause]
Nobody else has it. We became number one with me. Number one in the world in oil, we have oil and gas. Number one. Russia was number two. Saudi Arabia was number one. We were number three or number four. When I left, we were so far above them and we were going to be not only, we were energy independent, we were going to be energy dominant. We were going to sell to Asia, we were going to sell. We were going to pay off a lot of debt. We were all set to go.
And then we had a great election because we got millions more votes. But there's something happened a little bit. We can't let that happen again. We're not going to let that happen.
Look what happens when bad things like that happen.
I will cancel Kamala's insane electric vehicle mandate immediately. [cheers and applause]
Everybody will drive an electric car, they say. And soon the problem is they don't go far. They're very expensive. They're made in China and they have some other things. Now, with that being said, I think they're phenomenal. They really are.
I say that because of Elon.
Elon, they are phenomenal by the way. But for certain, whatever, and we're going to have hybrids, we're going to have gasoline-propelled cars. We're not going to have hydrogen cars. You know, hydrogen cars is the new thing, right? Do you know about that? Hydrogen is the new car. They say it's great. Has one problem.
If it explodes, you're dead. If it explodes. They actually say if it explodes, you're unrecognizable. You call your wife over, they call up the wife, would you please come here and take a look and see whether or not this is your husband because we cannot see. And she goes to the nearest tree, which is about 100 yards away, and she says, no, it's only blood. There's nothing there. She says, ""I can't tell.""
So hydrogen has one problem. It's extraordinarily dangerous. Other than that, the car works quite well, actually. I won't get near. I will never get, I don't care how good it becomes. No matter—and they'll probably say they're making it safe, but it'll never be safe enough for us, congressmen. I also announced last week that we will make interest on car loans fully tax-deductible—[cheers and applause] because affording a car is essential to restoring the American dream.
I got a call from a big guy on Wall Street, says, ""Where the hell did you come up with that idea?"" Think of how simple that is. How great is that? Because now we're going to make more cars because of it, right? They said, ""Where did you come up?"" When you think it's so simple? It was mentioned to me by somebody a week ago.
I said, has nobody, I think—a car loan deductible. Wouldn't that be nice? It's going to spur the industry, but what's really going to spur the industry is what we're doing with taxes and tariffs. Every company's going to come pouring back. But the interest deduction is so great. And I say it's like the paperclip. 125 years ago, a guy took a piece of metal and he started playing games with it, and he had the paperclip. And now since then, everybody that's seen the paperclip says, shit, why didn't I think of that?
It's so simple. That's like that for the car loans, right? It was so simple. Nobody thought. The biggest guy in Wall Street called me the smartest guy. He's got like 183 IQ. He said, ""Where the hell did you come up with that idea? That's pretty good."" As we rebuild our economy, we will also restore our borders, if you don't mind. [applause]
For four straight years, Kamala has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from prisons and jails and insane asylums and the worst mental institutions anywhere in the world, not South America, all over the world. They come from Venezuela. They come from the Congo in Africa, and she has resettled them very nicely into our communities, to prey upon our innocent American citizens, right?
When I went on November 5th, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins. It's going to be a restoration. [cheers and applause] One of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gangs, they're nice people, the only thing nice about them, they make our criminals look like nice people. Because now we say, I thought those guys were tough. They were really not tough. Not compared to these guys.
Remember when she said, migrants coming in do not cause crime? Really? Check out the front page of the New York Post today. They've taken over Midtown Manhattan,
But one of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gangs that Kamala has imported into our country is the savage Venezuelan prison gang known as Tren de Aragua. Have you heard of them? Tren de Aragua. In Aurora, Colorado, and communities in all 50 states, this gang is terrorizing law-abiding citizens, including taking over multiple apartment complexes. And they are really going and they are vicious as hell. Take a look at it—

Thank you.
So sad.
This is what you call an unforced error. What they've done to this country, and to think that she's running for the President of the United States is a disgrace, and she's allowed millions of these people into our country, destroying our country. And it's not easy to fix either. We'll get some and we'll get them out. Then they'll get somebody else who has a nice look and a child, and it'll be the poster. It'll be, ""Oh, how horrible are we?"" It's a very tough thing to fix, but we're going to fix it because we have no choice.
But we're going to start with these horrible criminals, and there are lots of them. 425,000 illegal aliens, convicted of crimes, are now free to roam in our country, including all of those murderers and all of those drug dealers and all of the human traffickers in women, in women.
They traffic in women. You hear children, you hear men. No, they traffic, really, in women. Right here, in Georgia, our nation was robbed of a brilliant 22-year-old nursing student, Laken Riley, you know Laken very well now. [applause]
And after months of prodding him, Biden couldn't pronounce her name, he said Lincoln Riley, and Lincoln Riley's the football coach. And this was in Congress. Couldn't even get the name right. Laken was a brilliant young student, top in her class, going to be a great nursing student. Everybody admired her. She was killed viciously. While out on a jog, she was assaulted, beaten, and horrifically murdered by an illegal alien. You saw the picture from Venezuela. The savage monster who murdered Laken was let in and released into our country by Kamala Harris. She came in through open borders. Nobody even checked him. Come right in. Come right in.
His brother was also in Georgia illegally. He suspected of viciously murdering someone also in the Venezuelan gang. He's in that gang. In September, an illegal alien who Kamala imported through her open border process was arrested in Tennessee for strangling a 25-year-old girl to death and leaving her body covered in blankets for days.
Her parents, oh, her parents. All of these parents. They'll never be the same. He had a prior arrest record in the United States, was shielded for deportation by the horrible, horrible laws, rules, and regulations of Kamala. I can't believe how they allowed this country to become like this. This country is not—It can't go on like this. And they're getting worse. You look at little towns, villages, cities, and even the big cities, they're petrified that this is going to happen to them.
The Governor of Colorado is a radical-left Democrat, but he just doesn't know what to do. He doesn't know what to do.
Springfield, Ohio. We love Ohio. We won Ohio every time, by a lot. We're leading now by a lot. And I know Springfield, beautiful little place. 50,000 people. They've just deposited 32,000 illegal migrants into the town. They don't speak English, but they've taken up the schools. They don't speak English. What they're looking for is interpreters because they have no idea what they're going to do. Nobody speaks—very few of them speak English, so they're looking all over for interpreters. That's what they want to find.
When you go to the hospital, you can't get into the hospital because the hospital's all occupied. And they want to be so nice and they want to be politically correct. And the mayor seems like a nice person. He's saying, ""We'll figure out how to make it work."" But you can never figure it out. It can never work. Think of it, 50,000 people, all of a sudden they have 32,000. They've almost doubled the size with people that came from a rough country, really a rough country. Immediately upon taking the oath of office, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. [cheers and applause]
Have to. Have to do it.
CROWD: USA! USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: I will rescue every town across America that has been invaded and conquered. They've conquered our country. This is an invasion of a military force. They have weapons that are on par with our US military, but we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals to jail or kick them the hell out of our country, ideally the second.
Because we don't want to have to pay for the costs, so we'll ideally bring them back to their country. When I first came into the White House, a General came up, I said, ""General, I want to get MS-13 gangs. They're the worst in the world."" MS-13 is very similar, but probably even nastier. And we had thousands of them in our country because Barack Hussein Obama could not get them out, because the countries from where they came would put airplanes, big ones, on the runway, so you couldn't land. They wouldn't let the buses through. And they gave up. Years ago, they gave up.
And I said to the General, ""I want them out."" He said, ""Sir, they won't take them back."" I said, ""Who?"" And they said the countries. I won't embarrass them because I know the presidents very well. And they're very streetwise, very smart people. And I said, ""How much aid do we give those three countries?"" ""Sir, we give them $750 million a year."" And I said, ""Inform them that they're delinquent, that they aren't allowing us to bring back people that belong there and they're getting no further aid at all from the United States."" [cheers and applause]
And the following day, early in the morning, I got calls from all three separately. All three, "" Sir, there seems to be a misunderstanding."" And I said, ""No, there isn't. You sent them over in a caravan."" The caravan. I made up that name too.
I'm good at names. You know the names. I can't use those names too much because many of them were for Republicans. We had some beauties, but we can use Pocahontas and other people. [laughter]
But I said, ""Listen,"" I said, ""You wouldn't take them back."" ""Sir, there seems to be a misunderstanding. We would love to take them back. We love MS-13 so much. Sir, please, please let us take them back. Sir, please."" And we sent them back and they took them like nothing. Like nothing. [cheers and applause]
We send them out of our country, and if they come back into our country, it's an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole. That way, they're not coming back. That way, they're not coming back. And you don't hear these ideas from anyone else. I can tell you, and I'm not proud of them. But you also have to wage a little bit of common sense, don't you? Because we're the party of common sense. And I'm hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer. [applause]
Kamala's migrant invasion, and that's what it is, is also devastating our great African-American community, stealing American jobs, crushing wages, undercutting the voting power of our own citizens and bringing drugs, crime and death to our country. And the African-American community and the Hispanic community is being devastated with the jobs.
The numbers are down six, seven, eight, 9%. They're going to work and they're saying, ""I'm sorry, we're not going to take you anymore."" People that have worked there, and worked there well for years, are now being told they no longer have a job because they have illegal immigrants coming in and taking their job. And I'll tell you what, any African American or Hispanic, and you know how well I'm doing there, that votes for Kamala, you got to have your head examined because they are really screwing you. They are really screwing you. [applause] Right? It's happening in numbers.
You're going to hear about it. It's a big story. It's a big story. You're going to start hearing about it in a little while. It's a big story. It's terrible, it's terrible. People that have been here for years, years, they've done a good job, they've got their family, and now all of a sudden, one day, they don't have a job anymore.
Kamala's open b order policy is a complete and total betrayal of African-American communities and Hispanic-American communities.
And unions are next. Oh, they're going to take on the unions. You watch. Virtually 100% of all of the jobs created in the last year have gone to migrants. I don't know if anybody knows that. First of all, the jobs that they got, which made their numbers look better, but they don't count really, they're bounce-back jobs. Those are jobs that we had. We had the greatest economy in history. We had to take a pause for the pandemic. We did a good job on that. And then the people, they call it bounce-back. It's standard, a very standard phrase, but they call it bounce-back. They bounce back. But think of it, of the jobs created, almost every one of those jobs was taken by a migrant. Under Trump, Americans will always come first. Take a look.

CLIP: [WOULD YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING DIFFERENTLY]
ANA NAVARRO: [clip from Harris' interview on The View on 10/8/24] Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?
VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: There has not a thing that comes to mind.
COMMENTATOR 1: We stood there on the tarmac watching you check your watch.
COMMENTATOR 2: The chaotic and deadly US evacuation from Afghanistan, stunned Americans at the world and cost the lives of 13 US soldiers.
NAVARRO: Would you have done something differently?
HARRIS: There is not a thing that comes to mind.
COMMENTATOR 3: More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder and been caught at the board, and then released into the United States.
COMMENTATOR 4: An Afghan National is in custody today after being accused of plotting an election-day terrorist attack. The suspect entered the US on a special immigrant visa.
COMMENTATOR 5: Gut-wrenching new details in the murder of Georgia. Nursing student Laken Riley. The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuelan national who crossed the unsecured southern border back in 2022.
COMMENTATOR 6: Two men investigators say are in the country illegally from Venezuela on charges of capital murder and the death of Jocelyn Nungaray.
COMMENTATOR 7: A fifth illegal immigrant accused of attacking two New York City police officers over the weekend showed no remorse or regret.
NAVARRO: Would you have done something differently?
HARRIS: There is not a thing that comes to mind.
COMMENTATOR 8: Only 18% said the economy is in excellent or good condition.
COMMENTATOR 9: US inflation has hit a new 40-year high, increasing by 9.1% over the financial year.
LAURA INGRAHAM: The cost of homes have spiked. Home buyers need to earn 80% more than they did in 2020 to afford a house.
INTERVIEWER 1: Were you the last person in the room?
HARRIS : Yes.
TRUMP: So she would do nothing different. Think of it. You have the worst administration in the history of our country. The happiest person, you've heard me say this, Jimmy Carter, because he looks brilliant by comparison. His administration, by comparison, is brilliant. So he's happy. He's an old guy now, but he's a happy man.
Just this week, I was proud to receive the official and unanimous endorsement of America's Border Patrol agents. All 100%. All of them. [applause]
And I was also honored to receive the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police. Something they don't do easily. [applause] But they said, ""We have no choice. We have no choice."" 400,000 law enforcement officers nationwide.
So they did something to Biden that was amazing. They stole the election from him. I'm not a fan of Biden, who could be, but they stole the election. They took it away like candy from a baby. And he's angry. And they were all angry. They're angry as hell. I think he likes me more than he likes her. Can you believe it? I believe that. I believe that, Steve. He likes me more than her. Can you believe it?
But we will restore law and order in America. But here's what, to do it, you have to do one thing. I don't want your money. I don't want anything. I just want you to get out and vote and get your friends to vote. [applause] That's it. I don't want money. Just go and vote.
So we're pleased to be joined with some incredible people, friends of mine, talented people. You have a lot of great people in this state. Lieutenant Governor, Bert Jones. Please, Bert, stand up. [applause]
Members of Congress, Mike Collins. [applause] Mike, great guy, tough guy. You don't play games. He said, ""Oh, put me in that committee. I want to be in that committee to cut costs."" He'll do a better job. Nobody could do like that. Thanks, Mike.
Somebody that's been unbelievable at searching out really bad, sick politicians on the other side. He was accused of—He walked in with a couple of young constituents to show them the Capitol, as I remember it, and they accused him of showing in Russians. What? And he became—Instead of most people, they say, ""Oh, please,"" He became the opposite. Indignant and wild. And he has done some job on the committee. Barry Loudermilk.
We love you, Barry. Courage.
I remember that. You're supposed to have pictures of him walking around with two kids from the area and the parents. They were Russian. These people are sick. And all it did is made him angry. And you have done some jobs, so we appreciate it.
A man that we've said hello to, that you've experienced. He's got a big future. He is a fantastic guy and a friend of mine, Byron Donalds. [applause] Byron, thank you. A very strong, smart person.
A woman who is amazing, actually, to me. She's really amazing. Marjorie Taylor Green, thank you. [cheers and applause]
And another warrior who's always been with us, Rich McCormick. [applause] Where is Rich? Thank you. Thank you, Rich.
And a really good guy, a former congressman, so respected by everybody. Doug Collins. [applause] Thank you, Doug.
And your former Senator who was really a terrific person and respected so much in Washington and still is even I think even more respected now, Kelly Loeffler. Thank you, Kelly. Good job. [applause]
The next congressman from Georgia's third congressional district. He's worked with me since like 2015, before '16. And everybody, after they got to know him, they said, ""Could we use him too?"" There was nobody like him. He's going to be a congressman. I think he always wanted to be a congressman. And when the seat came up in his district where he grew up, I said, go ahead. And did he win? Man, did he win, Bert? What's going on with him? He's making us all look bad. He got so many votes. Brian Jack. Where's Brian Jack? [applause] Thank you. There he is.
There he is. Is he a natural or what? Everybody loves this guy. I love this guy. It's not my thing either, but I love him. He is a special character, that one. Are you enjoying it, Brian?
BRIAN JACK: Very much so.
TRUMP: Good. He's got the word. He got the whole deal. He's good. He's going to be good for a long time. Your Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner John King. [applause] Thank you, John, very much. Thank you, John. Thank you, John.
Public Service Commissioner, Bubba McDonald. Bubba. [applause] What a man. A very special state senator. I just met his daughter, you not believe it or not, I was at another place two hours ago. I've been doing this for 42 days straight without a rest. [cheers and applause]
You believe it? 42.
But two and a half hours ago I was in another little different part of your state and this beautiful young woman said, ""My father is Brandon Beach,"" and I'm much more impressed with him now than it was two and a half—This guy is such a great patriot, State Senator, Brandon Beach. Thank you. And your daughter is fantastic. She was so proud of you. I said, ""He's that good, isn't he, right?"" She said, ""He's even better than that."" You got a good daughter. So it was great to meet her.
Georgia GOP chairman, Josh McKoon. [cheers and applause] And he is good. He is good. So Josh, stand up for—how the hell—Are we doing well?
JOSH MCKOON: Yes, sir.
TRUMP: Are we doing as well as I'm hearing?
MCKOON: Yes, sir.
TRUMP: All right. That's what I'm hearing. I'm hearing—And we're no longer in poll territory, right? We're in territory of votes coming in. We're not really looking so much at polls anymore. The votes are coming in, and they're coming in at a nice level for us, right? He's done a fantastic job. Thank you, Josh. I appreciate it. [applause]
A woman who I've known for a long time, and she's always been there for us. She's a special woman, very religious person. Every time she sees me, she prays. And I say from you, I accept that, and I will always accept it. Alveda King. Thank you, Alveda. Thank you. [applause]
Good genes. She's got very good genes, beautiful genes.
And a friend of mine, one of the most successful business people in the country, a great, great developer from Florida, New York, and a lot of other places, but just a terrific person. And he's become—I think he loves politics, but he wants to just make sure we all do well. That's all he wants. Mr. Steve Witkoff. Steve. Thank you, Steve. Great. Thanks, Steve. [applause]
So here are the facts. Kamala Harris is a radical-left Marxist, rated even worse than Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, that's Pocahontas. Remember? Her mother said she's Indian. Why? Because she's got high cheekbones. That was the reason. So I immediately called her Pocahontas, and that was the end of her. She was leading in the presidential race you know. And I don't think she likes me too much, but the mother said she had high cheekbones and I said, Pocahontas.
And then all the hell—the world went crazy.
And she actually went out and got a test, remember? And she was so happy. 1000th 24. In other words, maybe a million years ago there was a possibility, but she was happy. She said, this proves I'm an Indian.
And I said, no, no, I have more Indian blood in me, and I don't have any. I'd love to, but I don't have any. And that was the end of her presidential run. That was the end. I did the world a favor. Of course, look what we got. Look what we got.
Kamala destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of Defund the Police movement, and anybody who wants to defund the police for even one week or one day is not worthy of being president of the United States. It's a radical left person. Kamala vowed to abolish ICE. She wants to let her millions of illegal—Medicare. Oh, she wants to raid Medicare. That's what they're going to do. Raid Medicare, Social Security. She wants to ban fracking. As California Attorney General, that's what she did. And she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon and rape of an unconscious person as totally nonviolent crimes.
She said they're nonviolent crimes. She pledged to confiscate your guns and endorse the total ban on handgun ownership. She even called for free sex changes for prisoners and illegal aliens in detention at taxpayer expense. And here's something she did that was terrible. And here's something she did that was terrible, on her resume, she said she worked at McDonald's. She never worked at McDonald's.
So in conclusion, with your vote this November, we are going to fire Kamala and save America. [cheers and applause] Right? We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always cherish our great American flag. We will cut your taxes, crush inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages, and create the greatest job boom the world has ever seen. We're going to do that. It's not going to even be hard. We are going to do it through low taxes and high tariffs, actually.
We won't have any inflation, and we're going to do it. We're going to have a boom, and the auto industry is going to boom like it's never boomed before. We will hire American, buy American, build American, grow American, and show the whole world that the American dream is back bigger, better and stronger than ever before. [cheers and applause]
I will stop the global theft of American jobs and turn the U.S. into the manufacturing superpower of the world. I will end the war in Ukraine, stop the chaos in the Middle East, and prevent World War III. I can do that.
I will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources, and respect they so dearly—I'll tell you what, we have to give our police—We have to take care of our police and it's turning out to be more dangerous than ever. And once we give them that power back, it will be much less dangerous than ever. But right now, being a policeman or a policewoman is very dangerous. We have to give them back their honor, and we have to shield them, and we're going to indemnify them against being hurt because they do something that's good, and they lose their family, they lose their pension, they lose their house, they lose everything.
Now we're going to indemnify them. If they're right, and we're going to find that most of them—they're going to right—And you always have bad apples. It's a shame. It's a horrible thing. But sometimes, you have to just say, but we always have bad apples and we'll do everything we can to get those bad apples the hell out.
But we have to take care of our police and our law enforcement. That's why our country is going to hell with crime.
We will strengthen and modernize our military. We will build a missile defense shield all around our country, and it'll be made right here. A lot of it's going to be made, as you know, you do a lot of it, it's going to be made in the USA, but it's going to be made a lot of it right here.
And we will put the stars and stripes on the surface of Mars very soon. Very soon. [cheers and applause] We will get Elon to get those rockets going, Elon, get them going, get them going.
He is going to send a rocket up very soon to pick up the two guys. How would you like to be stuck in space? I said, when are you sending that? Very soon. I'm just about ready to send it. It's like sending a bus for him.
We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington, D.C., making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. They will get critical—Oh, and we will do this. Critical race theory and transgender insanity will be out of our schools immediately. [cheers and applause] Immediately.
And we will keep men out of women's sports. [cheers and applause] I will defend religious liberty, your right to free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms.
And the Second Amendment is under siege. You know that the Second Amendment is under siege. It will not be—Four years it was under siege, I will tell you. But we're going to protect our Second Amendment a hundred percent. [applause]
After years of built—Thank you. After years of building up other countries, we will protect our borders, defend our families, and protect our American suburbs, cities, and towns. We're going to protect our country. We will end the sanctuary cities immediately and stop illegal immigration once and for all. No more sanctuary cities. [applause]
We will put American citizens first, American children first, American patients first, American taxpayers first, American workers first, and American communities first, we will put our country first.
We will put communists, Marxists, and fascists last and they will always stay last. From Savannah to Columbus, from Marietta to Macon, and from Augusta to Atlanta, we inherit the legacy of red-blooded American patriots who poured out their blood, sweat, and tears to defend this country they love. [cheers and applause]
We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up those big beautiful skyscrapers. You're welcome.
Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom. And we are not going to lose the nation that they worked for and fought for and died for. We are not going to lose it. We will not be invaded. We will not be occupied. We will not be conquered. We will defeat the enemy at all levels of combat. We will defend our civilization, reclaim our sovereignty, and we will be a strong, proud, and free nation once again. [cheers and applause]
Right?
CROWD: Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!
TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you very much. Everyone will prosper. Every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with the opportunity and hope of a lifetime.
But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda once and for all. We want a landslide that's too big, too big. We can't let anything happen.
Early voting is underway. Get everyone out. Get everyone you know, just get them all out to vote. Go tomorrow.
After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of our country. These will be despite the fact that we've been set back so far by incompetent, vicious, foolish leadership, we will have the four greatest years in the history of our country. [cheers and applause]
And with your help from now until election day, we will redeem America's promise and we will take back the nation that we love. Nothing will sway us, nothing will slow us, and no one will stop us. We will press forward to our magnificent American destiny and together we will fight, fight, fight.
CROWD: Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!
TRUMP: We have to get out and vote. We have to win, win, win. We got to win, win, win. If you don't win, win, win, we've all had a good time, but it's not going to matter, right? Sadly. Because what we've done is amazing. Three nominations in a row, what we've done, we got to win. If we don't win, it's like it was all for not very much. We can't let that happen.
November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country and together we will make America powerful again. [cheers and applause]
We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. [cheers and applause]
We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. [cheers and applause]
We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. [cheers and applause]
Thank you, Georgia. God bless you. God bless you, Georgia. [cheers and applause]
Thank you. God bless you all. [cheers and applause]

    JIM GAFFIGAN: Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to bring up a man who loves New York City, he is the Republican nominee and the 45th President of United States, President Donald J. Trump. [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Thank you, everybody. Well, thank you very much. It's an honor.
And they told me under no circumstances are you allowed to use a teleprompter, and I got up here and I see there's this beautiful teleprompter. So here I am.
But it is a tremendous thing. It's a tremendous dinner. I've come here with my father. So it was three times, but it was also many times before that, a long time ago. And it's a very special dinner. And you've done a fantastic job, Cardinal. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. [cheers and applause]
So I'd like to thank, your eminence, very much and members of the clergy. So many people I know. Speaker of the House, Johnson, what a job you're doing. He has done a great job. [cheers and applause]
Senator Schumer, good. I supported him. [cheers and applause] I was, oh, I don't know. I don't know. He used to say that's true and now I'm not sure he would. But I gave him his first check from an office in Beech Haven and I was very proud of it. I don't know about it lately. No, I was, I was. It was his first check. He was running and I said, ""He's a good man.""
Senator Gillibrand, thank you very much. Thank you very much for working hard. [cheers and applause]
Governor Hochul, wherever you may be, this is a big dais, right? Where is the Governor? Good job. It's not an easy one, is it? But you're doing all right. We have to get a little money from the federal government. I have to tell you. [laughter] It's about time. It's about time. Mayor Adams, good luck with everything. [laughter] They went after you. They went after you, mayor.
Yeah, boy. I knew that. Nine and a half months ago, I said—And he just said something bad about the administration. He's going to be indicted any moment. [laughter] And guess what happened—But you're going to win. I think you're going to win. I know you're going to win. So good luck. Good luck. I don't like what they do. I don't like what they do. And also distinguished—I've got so many friends up here. It's uh great. Lot a great friends. Some of my best friends. And you are right, they are distinguished and they are wealthy for the most part. A couple are having a hard time, but they're going to get over it. [laughter]
I also want to thank my very beautiful wife and thank you for mentioning, but can you believe that she did a book? And it's a really good book and she worked hard on it, and it just became number one on the New York Times list, so I think that's okay. [cheers and applause] That's not an easy thing to do, especially when your name is Trump and you're on the New York Times list. That thing, that must be selling like hotcakes. But thank you for mentioning, I appreciate it. Good job, you did.
It's a true pleasure to be with you this evening. Amazing pleasure. And these days, it's uh really a pleasure. Anywhere in New York without a subpoena for my appearance. [laughter] Anytime I don't get a subpoena, I'm very happy. They've gone after me, Mr. Mayor. You're peanuts compared to what they've done to me. [laughter] And you're going to be okay. But I have to be careful, however, to understand that this will be the first time in the history of this event where jokes will be fact-checked and they will be. And they will be. It's been a long tradition for both Democrat and Republican candidates for president of the United States to attend this dinner.
Always, it's a rule. You got to go to the dinner. You got to do it, otherwise, bad things are going to happen to you from up there. [laughter] You can't do what I just saw on that screen, but my opponent feels like she does not have to be here, which is deeply disrespectful to the event and in particular to our great Catholic community, very disrespectful. [cheers and applause]
The last Democrat not to attend this important event was Walter Mondale, and it did not go very well for him. [laughter] He lost 49 states and he won one, Minnesota. So I said, there's no way I'm missing it. Actually, it was not easy for me to get here tonight. Cardinal, I wasn't going to miss this thing. No matter, I didn't care. I wasn't going to miss it. But that's true. Walter Mondale, 49 and one. He was expected to do well and it didn't work out. [laughter]
It shows you there is a God, I mean, for those people that are questioning. [laughter] I understand the real reason that she's not here is she's hunting with her running mate, spending a lot of time hunting. [laughter] In any event, it's a weird, weird, weird, weird—You know the word weird? They call me weird. They call JD weird. We're very solid people.
This guy is calling us weird. But this was weird that the Democrat candidate is not here and with us tonight. I want to also congratulate somebody who's going to make us all healthy. RFK Jr. we love you. [cheers and applause] I don't see him. He's campaigning all over the place. He's campaigning. You're all over.
Hello, you both. Nice to see you both. You're doing a good job. He's a great guy too. He really is. He's going to make us a healthier place. We're going to let him go wild for a little while. Then I'm going to have to maybe rein him back. [laughter] He's got some pretty wild ideas, but most of them are really good, I think. He's a good man and he believes the environment. The healthy people. He wants healthy people. He wants healthy food and he's going to do it. He's going to have a big chance to do it because we do need that.
I would not have missed the Al Smith dinner for anything in the world. I still remember coming here as a very young guy with my father, Fred. He was a great guy, my father. He was a tough cookie, but he had a very big heart. Anytime we'd walk down the street—And you don't see it too much anymore. There'd be people standing with tin cans, tin cans, and he would always take out $100 and put it in that can. And I always thought it was beautiful. And frankly, I even think more so now it was beautiful because nowadays you don't see it so much.
But I miss him. And we used to come here very religiously. And a great New York tradition has been born 79 years ago. It was born 79 years ago. And there are some people that were here for almost at length. I know many of them and it's not a pretty picture. [laughter] It's not a pretty picture.
The two candidates for president are supposed to exchange good-natured barbs, and we get along very well. I didn't like Biden very much, and now I like him quite a bit. [laughter]
Now I say that she's much worse than him. He was a much better candidate than her actually. And when we hopefully win, dispose of her, I like her a lot, but right now I can't stand her. It's true. [laughter] I can't stand her. I've never liked people that I was competing against. When you do, a lot of bad things happen.
And we are doing well by the way. The votes are starting to come in. You got to get out and vote. And Catholics, you got to vote for me. [cheers] Just remember. You better remember, I'm here and she's not. I could have done that too.
But you do something that's incredible. The Catholic church, you're helping the poor, educating children and supporting the vulnerable. But if you really wanted Vice President Harris to accept your invitation, I guess you should have told her the funds were going to bail out the looters and rioters in Minneapolis and she would've been here guaranteed. [cheers] She would've been here. Guaranteed.
She would've been okay. She would've been okay with that. But I know this isn't my normal crowd tonight because it just isn't. It's not my normal crowd. Believe me, my normal crowd is younger, has a lot more energy. [laughter] But you have certain advantages too, like cash, lots of cash. [laughter] But many of you're Manhattan liberals from the media and the Democrat Party. I always say the Democrat. You know—[Trump points to Chuck Schumer] Chuck doesn't like that. He likes Democratic and it sounds much more beautiful. The Democratic Party. I always say the Democrat Party, because it sounds worse. [laughter]
It's true. He likes Democratic. Why don't they just change the name this way? You know, it is Democrat. But I must say I was shocked when I heard that Kamala was skipping the Al Smith dinner. I'd really hoped that she would come because we can't get enough of hearing her beautiful laugh. She laughs like crazy. [laughter] We would recognize it any place in this room.
And all polls are indicating I'm leading big with the Catholic vote, as I should be, as I should be. But I don't think Kamala has given up yet. She hasn't. Instead of attending tonight, she's in Michigan receiving communion from Gretchen Whitmer. [laughter]
That's not a pretty sight. But Catholics, please don't be too insulted by Kamala's absence.
CROWD MEMBER: [inaudible]
TRUMP: If the Democrats—Thank you very much. I appreciate that. [laughter]
If Democrats really wanted to have someone not be with us this evening, they would've just sent Joe Biden. [laughter] You know he's having second thoughts, you know that, right? He wants to come back. If she does any worse than the polls, they're going to bring him back again.
I think, Chuck, he's going to do it. He's the one that got him out. That's the guy.
Much more so than crazy Nancy, I will tell you because I know him. He did it.
Joe has almost disappeared from view. The only way he could be seen less is if he had a show on CNN. They had nothing. [laughter] They've got nothing. Fake news, right? Fake. That term wasn't good. They say that term is no longer [inaudible] because it's much worse than fake. I don't want to tell you what the real name is. I won't do it because all those cameras would shut off immediately. They don't like that.
But apparently Joe didn't think it was fair for me to have the podium to myself with Kamala skipping the event. So he called, looked at me and said, ""Don't."" Does anybody understand that? [laughter] Yes.
I thought it was actually very good until just now. [laughter]
It was announced this morning that at a funeral yesterday, in a rare moment of clarity. Joe told Barack Hussein Obama, they quote—Only a few people got that. Or as Rush Limbaugh used to say, ""Barack Hussein Obama."" Remember him? He was a piece of work. We miss him. [laughter]
But as he told Barack Hussein Obama quote, ""She's not as strong as me. She's not as strong. Do you understand that?"" And Obama agreed saying, ""That's true. Other than that, I think the Democrats are getting along quite well.""
Right?—
Okay, nobody got that one. [laughter]
The fact is, we need new leadership in this country right now. We have someone in the White House who can barely talk, barely put together two coherent sentences, who seems to have mental faculties of a child. It's sad. He's a person that has nothing going. No intelligence whatsoever. But enough about Kamala Harris. [laughter] Let's get onto something.
I know Kamala's word because she spends a lot of time complaining. I won't agree to another debate. But the truth is, I've debated twice this year once against Joe Biden and once against David Muir of ABC. [laughter] That was amazing. 11 times. None for the other side. Do you think that's fair news? I don't think so. That's fake news. I don't know what's going to happen three weeks from now. It's going to be very interesting. It just started.
Its actually uh—its actually—isn't it sort of exciting, right? It really is. Isn't just exciting what's going on? It's a process. It's a rough process too. Not so pretty and yet sometimes very beautiful.
But the press is reporting the Democrats are starting to panic. They're panicking. They are panicking because you know the votes that are coming and are coming in very, very strong a certain way. I won't tell you what way that is, but Chuck Schumer is here looking very glum. Doesn't he look glum? He looks glum.
CHUCK SCHUMER: [shaking head] No I'm not [laughter]
TRUMP: But look on the bright side, Chuck, considering how woke your party has become, if Kamala loses, you still have a chance to become the first woman president.[laughter]
And actually, I said, ""Do you mind if I do that?"" He said, ""No, you got to do what you got to do. He's a pro. He's a professional."" No, he's a good man actually. I hate to say it. [laughter] Don't ever use it against me, please. They'll say, ""This dinner was really setting me back when I say it now."" But I've known him a long time.
There's a group called White Dudes for Harris. Have you seen this? White Dudes for Harris? Anybody know? Are some of you here? White Dudes for Harris? Doesn't sound like it. [laughter]
But I'm not worried about them at all because their wives and their wives' lovers are all voting for me. [laughter] Every one of those people are voting for me.
And as you may have seen, Kamala did an interview on Fox News yesterday. It went so poorly for her that the Democrats have been forced to install another 100 drop boxes throughout the city. [laughter]
And the upside really is Kamala now sees the benefit of deportation. She wants to deport people. She's vicious. She wants to deport people and she wants to start by deporting Bret Baier of Fox. It's an interesting interview last night.
A major issue in this race is child care. And Kamala has put forward a concept of a plan. A lot of people don't like it. The only piece of advice I would have for her and the event that she wins would be not to let her husband, Doug, anywhere near the nannies. Just keep them away.
That's a nasty one. That's nasty.
I told these idiots that gave me this stuff, that's too tough. [laughter]
Oh, they told me the last time I did this, I was running against Crooked Hillary and—I mean, Hillary. I was running against Crooked Hillary and I did it, and I thought it was a roast. So I was told it's a roast. And I had the meanest guy you've ever seen write stuff up and man, was the room angry. Even the Cardinal remembers. I went overboard.
Don't you agree, Cardinal? It was like terrible.
And I knew I was in trouble around midway through because people had— you know even my own side was angry at me. They were saying, ""It's too much."" But uh I did it anyway. I didn't give a damn. [laughter]
Campaigning could take a toll on a family and family life. Although I hear that Kamala and her husband carve out some really beautiful alone time at the end of the day for an intimate dinner. Just Doug, her and the teleprompter that she uses quite well.
And by the way, she wouldn't have liked this tonight if she was told about no teleprompter. I can't believe I saw a teleprompter. They said they've never had a teleprompter in the history of this dinner. I told that to the Cardinal, right?
And then a teleprompter pops up for—He must be a very important comedian to get that. They give you one, but not me. How about that one? Come here. [Trump shakes hands with Jim Gaffigan] And you did a good job.
Tradition holds that I'm supposed to tell a few self-deprecating jokes this evening. So here it goes—
Nope, I've got nothing. [laughter]
I've got nothing. [cheers and applause]
There's nothing to say.
I guess I just don't see the point of taking shots at myself when other people have been shooting at me for a hell of a long time and they shoot.
You know they say about presidents, they say that Andrew Jackson was the president that was the most meanly treated. His wife died. She died of heartache. She was heartbroken at the way they treated him. And they say that second was Abraham Lincoln, but he was in charge of a civil war you know.
But those were the two, Andrew Jackson—Up until me. Now they say it's not even close. There's never been a president that's been treated so badly as me and our people aren't happy about it. But I was treated a little bit rough, but I don't mind it somehow and I think it's just part of the game.
I'd like to thank our emcee this evening, Jim Gaffigan. Most recently Jim has been playing Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live, and that'll be a very short gig, I hope, Jim. [laughter]
But it was fun while it lasted, wasn't it? Let's see how that lasts, right? It better be quick. We don't want Tim, and I'm not going to say anymore. But unfortunately Governor Walz isn't here himself. But don't worry, he'll say that he was. [laughter]
He's going to say—I used to think that Democrats were crazy for saying that men have periods, but then I met Tim Walz. [laughter]
The stupid show, The View is so bad now that the other day I was watching it and thinking to myself, you know what? They really need to bring Rosie O'Donnell back. [laughter] That show is bad. Those people are bad. I know every one of them and they are bad news, I want to tell you. And it doesn't do very well either. I always like to say—you know ratings are very important. When they don't do well, it doesn't do very well. As I look around the dais, I see all of the usual suspects.
For instance, Mayor Adams. I'd like to poke some fun at Eric, but I'm going to be nice. I just want to be nice because I know what it's like to be persecuted by the DOJ for speaking out against open borders. [applause]
We were persecuted, Eric. I was persecuted and so are you, Eric. The Mayor's dietary restrictions are well known, but I've got to say I've never met a person who's a vegan who liked turkey so much. There's something about him with turkey, I just found that out today. And you know, I haven't been in New York that much. Don't let it—But, you're going to win, Eric.
We have another former New York City mayor with us, frankly, easily the worst in our history. [laughter]
And it's not Michael, that I can tell you. I'm surprised that Bill de Blasio was actually able to make it tonight, to be honest. He was a terrible mayor. I don't give a shit if this is comedy or not. [cheers and applause] He was a terrible mayor. He did a horrible job. That's not comedy, by the way. That's fact. [laughter]
But unlike the rest of New York, at least Bill doesn't have to worry about the criminals. They owe him big. He let them get away with a lot of stuff. Well, I'd better wrap up because Mayor Adams told me earlier that I needed to make this one very quick. Especially the city has reserved this room for a large group of illegal aliens coming in from Texas. That's right. They've reserved many rooms, many rooms, a lot of rooms, too many rooms.
But in all seriousness, it's an honor to be here to support the city and the community. It's a great community that I love. I've been here a long time and I love it. And that it's going to make a big comeback, and I'm going to help it make a comeback. I'm going to win and I'm going to make a comeback. We're going to turn this thing around. [cheers and applause]
And I want to pay tribute to a really incredible man, a man who was a tremendous politician and actually the fact that he was Catholic, was, it probably did him in. Nobody knows for sure, but uh he was a great guy. Al Smith, great guy. Everyone says it. Happy warrior.
I've said before that, I'll say it again, I'll say it again as many times as I have to directly to the Mayor and the Governor, if I have the honor to be elected next month—We're going to see what happens. It's happening so fast. But if I have the honor, I look forward to working together to make this city greater than ever before. We're going to do that. [applause]
We're going to be focused on our work with the governor. I'll work with the Mayor. Democrats, I will work with them. I work with whoever I have to, and we will even work very hard to bring back the SALT tax deduction. We're going to bring it back. We're going to bring it back. We're going to get that thing going, Chuck. Okay?
I actually thought about not doing jokes tonight. I was going to come out here and say, listen, our country is doing very badly. This is not about jokes. And then some person said, you have to do jokes. I said, I don't want to. There's nothing funny about what's happening to our country. And I actually meant that I was going to do that, but they convinced me to say some of the things I said tonight.
I don't know if they were funny or not. But hey, you think this is easy standing up here and doing this in front of half a room that hates my guts and the other half loves me. Half of us love me—Well, maybe it's I think 75% love me.
But I actually though I did think about that, and our country is doing very badly with respect to its open borders and inflation crushing, things happening in the Middle East and Ukraine. It's so sad to see what's happening in Ukraine. Wow. I had a lot of people, from—very religious people come up to me tonight from Ukraine, and they're asking me for help. So sad to see so many people have been killed in Ukraine and we're going to get it settled up if we win.
As I'm President-elect, I'm going to get that done. I'm going to do it before we ever get—We have to get it stopped. Too much killing. It's killing. And all of those cities are coming crashing down. Those beautiful golden domes are crashing down on their sides.
They're—so sad to see. The whole thing is so sad. So we're going to be—For all those people, there's so many people came up to the dais and religious people from Ukraine and I'm gonna say—I told them, don't worry, we're going to get it stopped. It's too bad it ever started. It should have never started. It wouldn't have started. But uh we're going to have our country respected again. We're going to make sure that it's respected and we're going to go out and do very good things for ourselves as a country and for the world.
These are challenging times for our beautiful USA. But I'm committed to working with every partner here in New York and all across the nation to build an America that once again is strong and safe and proud and prosperous and free. I'm going to make sure.
Together we can create a future defined by great ambitions and grand achievements that once again inspires the dreams of our children, brings back the American dream. You don't hear about the American dream anymore. We're going to make it possible for them to have the American dream. This is a very religious evening to me, it really is. It represents so much.
My sister was somebody that loved the church and gave to the church. The cardinal knew that. Had a certain priest that she thought was incredible, right? A certain, very fine man that she thought was incredible.
Having recently myself survived two assassination attempts, I survived. I have a chart that went down to the right, fortunately I looked, it's my all-time favorite piece of paper.
But it went down and I looked to the right and I said, you know, was that luck? Was that luck or was that God that did that? And I think it was God that did that. I do. I do. [cheers and applause]
But I have a very fresh—Cardinal, I have a very fresh appreciation for how blessed we are by God's providence and his divine mercy. I mean, that was something I was not supposed to be here tonight that I can tell you. So with God's help, I know there is nothing that cannot be achieved.
We can achieve so much good with this country and get together and unify.
I want to thank the Al Smith Foundation for its noble work, and I want to express my tremendous gratitude to the Catholic community. It's a great community. It's a community I've gotten along with all my life. I'll tell you, when I was, when I was president I was in the Oval Office that I got a call from the Cardinal and he said, we need help.
It was during the China virus, I want to be accurate when I describe it. [laughter]
And he said, we need help. Our schools are in devastating shape. They needed much more than a billion. I won't even tell you the number. But much more than a billion dollars. But I've known the community and I've known the schools. I know so many people that were educated in the Catholic school system and they are great, and they just speak with it with love much more so than almost any system that I've seen. And he said, sir, we have a big problem. We need a number of billions of dollars or we're going to have to close down the New York School System, the whole system in New York. And I said, give me 15 minutes. I think I can find it. And we gave him billions of dollars. And you know what? He stayed open and they thrived. And to this day I hear you did just about the best job there is in education. [applause]
And that was always an honor. And every time he sees me, he says, thank you very much. I said, I know what you're talking about. But we worked together. We were a good partnership. We got that money in about 15 minutes, billions, and uh it was put to very good use.
But I just want to thank everybody. This is a special evening. It's a very serious evening, I think. We have some serious problems in the world, but they're going to get solved and we're going to make America great again.
And thank you very much.
And God bless you all. [cheers and applause]
Thank you. Thank you very much.

    [music: Lee Greenwood, ""God Bless the USA"".]
TRUMP: Thank you everybody. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you very much.
And a very, very special, we love this place. We love Detroit. Thank you very much. [cheers and applause]
And hello to Michigan. We win Michigan, we win the whole ballgame. Thank you very much. I'm thrilled to be back in this incredible state with thousands and thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. Thank you very much, everybody.
So I'd like to begin by asking a very simple question. Are you better off now than you were four years ago?
CROWD: No. [booing]
TRUMP: Not even close, and our country's not better off, that I can tell you. Early mail-in voting in Michigan is now underway. So here in Detroit, early in-person, voting starts tomorrow, so get the hell out and vote. You got to get out and vote. With your help, 18 days from now, we are going to win the state of Michigan. We are going to defeat Kamala Harris, [cheers and applause] and we are going to quite simply make America great again. We're going to do it. We're going to do it. [cheers and applause]
You know, Detroit has such great potential, but Kamala and the Democrats have been wreaking havoc on this place, this very, very—In many respects, it's a sacred place. So many things happened in Detroit and it's been treated so badly. And they've been talking about comebacks for so long, but we're going to bring it back better than it ever was, better than it was many, many years ago. [cheers and applause]
We're going to make Detroit great again. We're going to make it great again. They have been talking about it for years and years and years. For generations, this city and state where the world capital of automotive production and one of the great manufacturing centers in all of history. No matter where you went, this was the greatest in all of history.
But year after year, globalist politicians like Crooked Joe Biden— [booing] —Lying Kamala Harris— [booing] —Sold you out and let other countries loot, pillage, and plunder our wealth, our jobs, and our dreams. And they did that here more than any other place in our country. 40% of Michigan auto jobs were annihilated after NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization was a disaster for your beautiful place, your beautiful city, and frankly your beautiful state. Detroit was decimated. [booing] That's right. Detroit was decimated as if by a foreign army. It was no difference. Our factories were left in ruins. And under Kamala Harris, this year alone, the United States has lost nearly 50,000 manufacturing jobs. You know, they're doing a terrible job. [booing]
Did you see her interview the other night? She said, ""Essentially I'd keep it the way Biden had it."" That's great, that's great. He got out because of the way he kept it. She'll keep it the same way.
U.S. car sales are down 38% since I left office. But with victory in November, we're going to take back what is ours. And it is ours. We're going to take it back. We're going to bring back our jobs, our dignity, and our dreams. [cheers and applause]
And standing before you tonight, I am proclaiming to the people of this state that by the end of my term, the entire world will be talking about the Michigan miracle and the stunning rebirth of Detroit. [cheers and applause]
And this will be a real rebirth.
Under the Trump administration all who have robbed you, raided you, ransacked you, and abused you will discover very quickly, America will not be taken advantage of anymore. We were taken advantage of for years, for decades. [cheers] We will reclaim our stolen wealth, and the days of Detroit's economic glory will return greater and stronger than ever before. Promise. [cheers and applause]
And I know how to do it. Oh, do I know how to do it—I will put Detroit first, I will put Michigan first, and I will put America first. And that's the way it is. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: USA, USA, USA, USA, USA!
TRUMP: As we speak, China was building a gigantic auto plant in Mexico. You know about that. And really more than one. [booing] Don't worry about it. I took care of it for you, took care of it. It's already done without even closing the big deal, which is the presidency. I've already got it done.
Of course, if she got in, she has no idea what the hell she's doing. She's grossly incompetent, worse than him. Then I cannot tell you what's going to—I can tell you. They'll build the plant. I can tell you. But it's already done. They think they're going to sell all of their cars into the United States and destroy Michigan. But it's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. I promise you. [cheers and applause]
Now they're building giant plants, and now they just announced something which is going to save Detroit. Because you would not be able to compete with this plant, the biggest in the world by far. Friend of mine builds them. He said the biggest in the world. He wanted to show it to me. I said, ""No, thank you. I have other things to do."" I want to see the plants built in the United States. That's the ones I want to look at.
So I said to him, ""John,"" a year ago, ""I want to see a plant."" And he said, ""Sir, we'll have to go to Mexico."" I said, ""I don't want to go to Mexico. I want to look at one here."" I said, ""There's no big ones being built in the United States."" I said, ""That's bad."" I said, ""How big is it in Mexico? The biggest in the world?"" I said, ""So they're going to make cars and sell them in here."" Kill Detroit, kill Michigan. You wouldn't have anything left. [booing] You wouldn't have anything left. [booing] So the other day I was speaking—A couple of weeks ago, I was speaking at the Economic Club of Detroit, which was nice. Made a nice speech. And what happened?
I saw John, who's the biggest and the best auto builder. That's what he does. He builds plants. I don't know if he can build anything else. I'm not sure he can build an apartment, but plants he's very good at. And I hadn't spoken to him in a year. He was telling me about this massive plant. And I spoke and I explained how I'm going to put massive tariffs, very big tariffs on anybody in Mexico that's selling cars that are going to hurt our business here. And I said to him, ""How's that plant coming along, John?"" And he said, ""Sir, they just told me it's over. They're not building it. They think Trump is going to win. He's going to impose tariffs and it's worthless."" [cheers and applause]
You owe me big. You owe me. You owe me. So they stopped construction. They're not building it. And Detroit will survive. But now we got to make it more. Now we're going to build the plants. So I'm going to do, sometime next week, I'm going to call the people building the plant. Very big wealthy company. It's backed by China. It's China, you know? It's China. It's in Mexico, but it's China. And I'm going to say, ""Build your plant in the United States."" We want people to build plants in the United States, employ our people. That's what we want. And if you do that, it's a whole different story. And ideally they'll build it right here in Detroit. [cheers and applause] And we'll get Detroit moving, and others will come also.
So vote Trump, and you'll see a mass exodus of manufacturing jobs from Mexico to Michigan, from Shanghai to Sterling Heights, and from Beijing to right here in Detroit and other cities all across America. Because a strong auto industry will make all of Detroit richer, boosting suppliers, real estate, and your entire economy. And you know I've been reading. Seriously, I've been reading about Detroit for so long, the comeback. This is the real comeback. This isn't artificial stuff. This is the real comeback. [cheers and applause]
You better vote for me. So very simply—It's not overly complex. Some people don't understand it. If you watched Bloomberg the other day, you would've seen the CEO of Bloomberg interview me, and I think he understood it. And I think the Wall Street Journal now understands it. Because to me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary—It's not love, it's not respect—[Trump's microphone cuts out at 10:37. He paces the stage and waits for a fix, occasionally trying the mic, until 28:46 when the microphone begins working again. The crowd chants repeatedly, and Trump occasionally tries the mic again.]
CROWD: Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump—
USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA—
Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump—
We want Trump, We love Trump, We love Trump, We love Trump—
USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA—
We love Trump, We love Trump, We love Trump—
TRUMP: [muted] Can you hear me? Can you hear me? [inaudible]
CROWD: We love Trump, We love Trump, We love Trump
Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump—
One! Two! Three! Trump! One! Two! Three! Trump!
Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight—
USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA—
Thank you Trump! Thank you Trump!
[audio is restored]
TRUMP: Hello—[cheers and applause] [walks around stage]
Well, thank you everybody. Thank you. So now what happens is I won't pay the bill for this stupid company that rented us this track. [cheers and applause] I won't pay the bill and then we'll have a story that Trump didn't pay the bill to a contractor. No, when they do the kind of a job, don't pay the bill. That's terrible.
They also had a little problem with energy coming into the building, but I'm not blaming it on that. But here is my plan. Do we have fun? [cheers and applause] And can everybody hear perfectly now?
CROWD: Yeah [cheering].
TRUMP: I don't like the mic anyway. I didn't like it from the minute I started. And this is important because we're doing things here that are really going to be amazing. So let me know and if it goes out again, I'll sue the ass off that company. [cheers and applause] We're going to sue him. Then they'll say what a horrible guy Trump is. He's a terrible guy.
Starting in January, we will give our companies the lowest taxes, the lowest energy cost, the lowest regulatory burdens, the free access to the best and biggest market on the planet. That's us. But only if they make their products here in America and hire American workers for the job. [cheers and applause]
And if these companies don't make their cars and products here, then they will pay a tariff. A very stiff tariff when they send their products into the United States for the privilege of competing with our workers and our cherished companies. We're going to protect our companies. We're not going to let them steal our companies like they have in the past. We're going to call this policy Build it in America Plan. Because when foreign leaders and CEOs call me up to complain about our tariffs, my answer will be very simple. Build it in America. Very simple.
And to be specific, build it in Detroit and we'll give you good electricity. [cheers and applause] Or build it in Dearborn, or Lansing, or Grand Rapids, or Flint. Flint.
The centerpiece of this plan will be a 15% made in America corporate tax rate. So we brought the rate down and you saw this from close to 40% to 21% and you've already had that. Nobody thought it could be done. We got it down to 21. Now we're going to get it down to 15%, but only if they build it in America. Does that make sense? [cheers and applause]
And for those who don't make their product in America, they will be forced to pay tariffs and we will take in hundreds of billions of dollars toward our budget. We'll pay down our debt. We'll reduce your taxes still further. I give you the largest tax cut in the history of our country and we will take in so much money and we will take in so many jobs and we will be bringing for the first time in years and years and decades, companies will be coming to us and they'll be coming back to Detroit and they'll love it. [cheers and applause]
Some say my defense of American Jobs makes me a protectionist. And yes, I will protect what is ours. I will protect our workers. I will protect our jobs and I will protect our borders. I will protect our families and I will protect the birthright of our children to live in the richest and most powerful nation on the face of the earth. [cheers and applause]
These pro-worker policies are among the many reasons, and it's not protectionist, it's pro-worker. It's really not protectionist. We've had people ripping our country for years, decades destroying. You look outside, you see all the hulks, you see the empty buildings. For years and years they've been ripping us off. Now it's time for us to get it back. We're going to get it all back. [cheers and applause]
These pro-worker policies are among the many reasons why I've been overwhelmingly endorsed by the rank-and-file membership of the Teamsters, including 62% of the Teamster members and there are a lot of them here today. Stand up please. Teamsters, we love you. Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
Kamala does not even pretend to have a plan to save Detroit because she knows her agenda will reduce your future to rubble. He's not going to—Her plan will drive every company, even small businesses out of our country or out of business. It's a disaster. It is a disaster. [booing]
Kamala's inflation has already cost a typical family over $30,000 in higher prices and now she's proposing to raise the typical family's taxes by nearly $3,000 a year. So watch these two videos. Let's see if they have some electricity going to them please. And it would be nice if the television cameras could watch them also because they don't do that.
[shows video montage]
CLIP: [TAX CUTS AND INCREASES]
COMMENTATOR 1: Mr. President, there are many different tax policies which could cripple the economy. But the first thing she wants to do is allow these Trump tax cuts to expire.
COMMENTATOR 2: Even the New York Times admits that 85% of the middle class got a tax cut.
COMMENTATOR 3: Americans will face a hike. The tax foundation, finding that a couple with two kids making $165,000 a year would have to pay over $2,400 more in taxes.
VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: And on day one, I will repeal that tax bill. Joe Biden and I are about to work to get rid of that tax cut. Joe and I are about to get rid of that tax bill. Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax cut.
COMMENTATOR 4: Everything from a 70 to 80% tax rate.
HARRIS: I think that's fantastic. We've got to increase the corporate tax rate. Part of that is going to be about repealing that tax bill that they just passed, and also looking at estate taxes are going to have to go up. We will tax capital gains. But we're going to have to raise corporate taxes.
[crosstalk among unnamed commentators]: Taxing unrealized gains just doesn't seem fair in any sense of the word.
Because you're paying for schools.
When the value of your home goes up, you pay higher taxes even if you don't sell your home.
It's tiring.
Your value of your home never moves the way the stock moves to say, ""We're going to tax what you don't have."" That's a sore point and it's a big deal. Is that something you think she firmly believes in?
I think it's part of the proposals of the campaign.
HARRIS: Under my plan, there will also be a carbon fee. There has to be some connection between the fee and bad behaviors, and there has to be, in that we have to monitor whether it's going to be passed on to consumers. But I'm going to tell you that should never be the reason not to actually put a fee, and in particular a carbon fee. [booing]
NARRATOR: Kamala Harris is going to significantly raise taxes.
HARRIS: Taxes are going to have to go up.
NARRATOR: Kamala's plan will raise families taxes by nearly $2600 a year. Under Kamala, prices have already soared. Now she'd make it worse with even higher taxes.
HARRIS: Taxes are going to have to go up
NARRATOR: President Trump will cut taxes again. No taxes on tips, overtime, or social security.
TRUMP: I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message. [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you very much. [cheers and applause]
This is the worst mic I've ever had in my life. [laughter]
This is the worst.
The tax queen is also demanding a shocking 33% tax hike on all domestic production along with the largest capital gains tax hike in the history of our country. In other words, she's going to tax your companies and you out of business. The companies are going to leave and you're going to end up with the same message you've had for the last 40 years. In total, our proposals are estimated to kill almost a million full-time jobs under Kamala, who knows absolutely nothing about what we're doing. It will be economic Armageddon for Detroit.
You go back further—Very simply, we're going to make it great. We're going to make it so good. You're going to have jobs coming in like never before. [cheers and applause]
Under Trump we'll turn this city into the most powerful jobs magnet in the history of the world. Upon taking office, I will immediately begin to eliminate every job killing regulation in the books. We eliminated more than any other President in four years. There's never been a President that eliminated more times five.
As a senator—Kalam[sic]—Ugh, this one here, Kamala. You know I'd like to call her Harris, but nobody knows who the hell I'm talking about. [laughter] You ever see that? Like you say Harris, ""Who the hell is Harris?""
As a senator, Kamala voted to impose a 100% ban on gas powered cars and trucks, which would kill an estimated 200,000 U.S. auto jobs. [booing]
On day one of the Trump administration, I will terminate Kamala's insane electric vehicle mandate and we will end the green news scam once and for all. [cheers and applause] We will quickly become energy independent and we will frack, frack, frack, and drill baby drill. [cheers and applause]
I will cut your energy prices in half within 12 months. So listen, I will cut your energy prices in half, 50%, 5-0. Cut them in half within 12 months of taking office. That's going to bring everything down. I will massively cut taxes for workers and small business and we will also have no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on social security benefits for our seniors. [cheers and applause]
I will make interest on car loans fully tax-deductible. And we will—They will be so—listen to that. What will that do for the cars? Fully tax-deductible interest on a car. You buy a car and you get a deduction. Wall Street called me up. They said, ""How the hell did you think of that idea?"" That's a good one because affording a car is essential to restoring the American dream and you're going to have the American dream. Finally, I haven't had it in 50 years.
Working with Elon Musk—Is he good or what? [cheers and applause] I saw that rocket come down three, four days ago. That sucker was coming down. I said, ""Oh my God, I never saw anything like it."" I was on the phone with a friend. I'm talking about something. I don't know, something maybe having to do with Detroit. Could that be possible?
But I'm talking on the phone and I see the screen is on and no sound. And I'm saying, ""Wait a minute, I have to put the phone down. I don't believe what I'm seeing."" And I saw that big monster coming down that big—It's like a twenty-story building or something coming down. The engines are glowing and they're firing and spitting. And I said, ""It's going to crash. It's going to crash into the gantry, don't crash."" And then you see another engine take it perfectly and lands right at the spot that it took off. I said, ""That must be Elon. He's nailed it. [cheers and applause]
Nobody else."" It must be Elon. So I called up Elon. I said, ""Elon, was that you?"" He goes, ""That was me."" I said, ""Who else can do it?."" ""Nobody."" I said, ""Can Russia do it?"" ""No."" ""Can the U.S. do it? Meaning the U.S. outside of you?"" He said, ""No, nobody can do that."" I said, ""You're the coolest. That's pretty."" And he endorsed me long time ago actually saying It's the most important election we've ever had. [cheers and applause]
But working with Elon Musk, we will cut trillions of dollars in government waste. He's very good at that. He knows better than anybody. It won't affect anybody other than it'll look awfully good and it'll help bring our country back. I want to thank also Elon for campaigning so hard in Pennsylvania. Do you know he actually feels this? Can you imagine? He just lands his biggest landing anyone's ever seen and he leaves for Pennsylvania to campaign for me. Can you imagine that? [cheers and applause]
And he also, and we got to say this. I went to North Carolina, which really was hit hard. Georgia too, really hit hard. But in North Carolina they had no communications. It was like they were an island unto themselves. And I said to the people, ""What can we do?"" He said, ""We have no communication. People are dying. It's a mess."" They said, ""The federal government, Washington is doing a terrible job. Sir, do you know Elon Musk?"" I said, ""I happen to know him. He endorsed me. What's the problem?"" He said, ""Can you get Starlink?"" I said, ""What the hell is Starlink?"" [laughter] And they explained it to me. I'm a fast study. It didn't take too long. So I called up Elon and I was saying, ""Elon, we're in North Carolina. The people are really—It's devastation here. It's unbelievable. They have no communication to the mainland. It's like it cut it off. It's incredible. The water was never—We've never seen anything like that.""
I said, ""Elon, Starlink."" It's very hard to get by the way, because it's very successful, very hard to get. I said, ""Can you get Starlink, a lot of those suckers? Can you get them for North Carolina and parts of Georgia?"" And I was talking to him about it and all of a sudden I get a call in the other line. It's the man from North Carolina. ""Thank you sir, for getting the Starlink."" I said, ""I haven't even finished my conversation."" Now think of that. [cheers and applause]
I said, ""Elon, I haven't even finished my conversation. And they're already saying, you sent."" ""That's right. I did that. I do two things at one time. I can do that."" So he's great. He saved a lot of lives, I think, and he really—And by the way, the Starlink worked perfectly. As soon as he got there was perfect. So thank you to Elon for that he did a great job. [cheers and applause]
And if we do all of this, our flag will fly proudly once more over the gleaming new factories and the whole world will witness Michigan's resurgence. Wealth will flood into our country and into the hands of our great workers. And that is the future that awaits for Detroit under a certain gentleman named President—President Donald J. Trump. Have you heard of him? [cheers and applause]
It's going to be real. It's going to be real. As we rebuild our economy, we'll also restore our borders. Did you ever see anything like what's coming through our borders? Criminals, drug dealers, prisoners, people from mental institutions. For four straight years, Kamala has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from prisons and jails, insane asylums, and mental institutions all around the world from Venezuela to the Congo, and she's resettled them into your communities to prey upon innocent Americans. I happen to think it's the worst thing that's happened. I think it's worse than inflation. I think it's worse than a bad economy. I think it's the worst thing that happened to us. [cheers and applause]
21 million people. When I win on November 5th, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins. I have no choice. [cheers and applause]
One of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gangs that Kamala has imported into our country—Or to say it a little differently, Kamala, but I don't give a damn if I pronounce it right. Who the hell can pronounce—? It's the savage Venezuelan prison gang, Tren de Aragua. Do you know them? It's a very nice group of young gentlemen, very fine people. There were gang members in Venezuela. We let them into our country. By the way, they're taking over parts of cities all over the place. But in Aurora, Colorado, and communities in all 50 states, this gang is terrorizing law-abiding citizens, including taking over multiple apartment complexes. This, you have to take a look at this. Take a look.

[text overlay, ""End the Occupation Liberate America""] [booing]
TRUMP: Just so you know, we have the most dangerous criminals in the world in our country now. We never had anything like this. These are the most dangerous criminals in the world. They make our criminals look like very nice people. That's about the only thing you can say.
But they are the worst among the worst people and they come from all over the world. I thought it was 158 countries. Last week, they reported it's 181 countries. They're coming from all over the world. They're emptying their prisons into our country, mental institutions, into our country, and they're taking their street gangs, and their drug dealers, and terrorists are now in our country. 21 million people came in under their rule and she was in charge of the border. She's a grossly incompetent person and we can't let this happen. We have to get the hell out and vote and get them out of here. [cheers and applause]
The United States is now an occupied country. How about that? Do you ever think you'd be hearing that? We're an occupied country. We're being occupied.
You know, if you have a million person army, that's a big army. They've got millions and millions of people. If they just take a small percentage of them, they'd have six million-man or woman army. Think of that.
They've let these people into our country, they're emptying out the jails all over the world, the mental institutions all over the world, they're coming in. I think it's the biggest problem we have. I don't care. Deflation and inflation, it's all bad stuff, but this is—The polls say the biggest problem is our economy, which stinks. The second-biggest problem is inflation, which is devastate—worst we've ever had. And the third is our border. I think the border is the first biggest problem—[mumbling]its one of the three.
But November 5th, 2024 will be Liberation Day in America. [cheers and applause]
And when I get rid of this microphone at the end of the speech, it's going to be Liberation Day for Donald J. Trump because I'm blowing out my voice to get this sucker done. I'm blowing out my voice. But I'm going to get through this speech because you're from Detroit. We're going to turn this place around. We're going to make sure that electric current comes into it like it should.
Liberation of Donald Trump. Good night, folks. That'll be—That's terrible.
But I think it's okay. I mean, you can hear it. If I scream like hell into the mic, I think good for you, not so good for me. But that's okay. That's what my life has been about for the last 10 years. And that's good because we love you. We're going to turn it all around for you.
Under Kamala Harris, 13,099 illegal aliens, convicted murderers are on the loose in the United States. Immediately upon taking the oath of office, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. I have no choice. We have no choice. [cheers and applause]
I will rescue every town across America that's been invaded and conquered, and I will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail or kick them the hell out of our country, which is my number one choice. [cheers and applause]
To expedite removals of the Tren de Aragua gangs and other savage gangs like MS-13, which is just as bad. We have by the thousands now. I took them out by the thousands and they now are coming back in by the thousands. These people, what they've done to our country, I can't even believe it. I can't even believe it.
I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, that's where we had to go, to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil. We will call it Operation Aurora. We want to pay tribute to Aurora, Colorado. The governor there is a radical left Democrat. He is petrified. The guy just don't want to walk out of his mansion. And if they come back into our country, it's an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole. So we keep them out. [cheers and applause]
And I am hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Kamala's migrant invasion is also devastating our great African-American community, stealing American jobs, crushing wages, undercutting the voting power of our own citizens, and bringing drugs, crime, and death to our country. You know, we're devastating the African-American population, they're taking their jobs. It's terrible. It's terrible. And also Hispanic, they're taking a lot of Hispanic jobs. And the jobs created by Biden are all being taken by people coming into the country illegally. So you know, it's terrible. Yet Kamala says there is nothing she would do differently. Listen to this, she'll do nothing differently.

INTERVIEWER 1: Were you the last person in the room?
HARRIS : Yes.
CROWD: BOOO
TRUMP: You know she destroyed San Francisco. She destroyed California along with Gavin Newscum. Destroyed it.
Did you say when Newscum said that you're not allowed to even ask for voter ID? If anybody asks somebody for voter ID, it's considered a crime. [booing] You know why? Because they want to cheat. There's only one reason why.
We want to be very careful. Detroit, if you want to end this disaster, you must get out and vote. You have to get out and vote right now. And with that, I'd like to acknowledge some of our great friends and he just spoke, so I don't want to have to waste his time. But he did just speak and he's great. He's one of our really true leaders in this country. We're all lucky to have him running for the Senate. Mike Rogers. Where's Mike? [cheers and applause] Mike, thank you, Mike.
And I don't want him to get up and use this crappy microphone that they sent. I don't want him to do that. I want to keep him good and healthy. Unlike Trump, I want him to have his voice tomorrow. When I get up tomorrow and I can't speak, I'm going to say Detroit did it to me, but that's what—[cheers and applause].
We're also pleased to be joined by a future star and, really, a current star. He's a great guy. He's a friend of mine. Congressman—Do you know who he is? Byron Donalds. [cheers and applause] Congressman Donalds, thank you. Thank you, Byron. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. Thank you very much, Byron.
Michigan House Republican leader, Matt Hall. Matt, thank you, Matt. How are we doing here, Matt? We doing good? Going to win? I hope. We got to win. So far, we're winning. And Senate Republican leader, Eric Nesbitt. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Eric. Thank you very much, Eric.
A man that I said, ""You got to do this. You got to do it."" He wasn't sure if he wanted to. You know he had a great career. I said, ""I'm sorry, Pete Hoekstra. You got to do it. You got to become the GOP chairman.""
Ambassador Pete Hoekstra. Thank you, Pete. Great job. [cheers and applause]
So, Pete, are we going to win? Thus far, I hear like, ""Way above projection. We're not even talking about polls anymore. These are way above projection."" A man who is probably more knowledgeable about autoworkers for Trump and autoworkers, period, and who knows exactly what we're doing. He's a member of the union, but he's not happy with what they're doing with the whole thing, what they're doing. They've lost a lot of jobs over the last few months and it's going to continue until you have no jobs in this country. We're not going to let it happen. We are going to have more jobs and it's going to be more powerful as an automobile capital than it was in its heyday, 60 years, 70 years ago. [cheers and applause]
It's going to happen. It's going to happen fast.
Brian? Brian, stand up. Pannebecker. Brian Pannebecker, thank you very much. Thank you, Brian.
And Dr. Massad Boulos, great friend of mine, and Michael Boulos, my son-in-law, he's a wonderful young man. Stand up, please. That's good. That's good. [cheers and applause]

We also have a man highly respected in Michigan, Imam [Husham Al-]Husainy. Imam, please, wherever you may be, stand up. Thank you. Thank you very much. Great. Thank you very much. Great honor to have you. [cheers and applause]
And we have a guy—I made so much money with this guy. He was brutal. He was a brutal man. Happened to come from a place called Detroit, or as they say, Detroit. He says, ""I come from Detroit,"" which is cool as hell if you're The Hitman, Tommy Hearns. The Hit Man. [cheers and applause] Tommy, come up here, Tommy. Come up. Come. Come. Come up here. Tommy the Hitman. We love Tommy. I won so much money betting on this guy. He was brutal. We love that. Look at him. He still looks good. He still looks good. Wow.
They have to take—Secret Service has got a little—I don't know, is there such a thing as overpr—[sic].But Tommy is going to have to cross about nine gates. I don't think so, Tommy. About 25 years ago, he would've just hopped over them. Hey, Tommy, you're still good, huh? You think I could take you now in a fight right now? [laughter] No, I don't think so. Look at him. He wants to—Oh, no, he wants to fight. [cheers and applause]
Oh, Tommy the Hitman. Man, oh, man. Some of the greatest fights in history. Oh, look, he wants to come up. We should have him up, right? [cheers and applause]
Come on, Tommy. Man, oh, man. I saw him in the audience. I said, ""We got to get—I see a lot of people in the audience. I'm not bringing them up. Come on, Tommy.
CROWD: Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!
TRUMP: One of the greatest fighters of all time. And, man, I'll tell you what, he was something special. And thank you, Tommy. And he looks great, doesn't he? He looks great. [cheers and applause]
TOMMY HEARNS : Now, hearing those nice words coming from you, man, it's got to be real. It's got to be real. I got—because, I myself, I never thought I was told [inaudible] great fighter, but I thought I did a pretty good job. But hearing it come from you, Donald, I'm excited. Yeah. I'm very excited.
TRUMP: Ah that's good.
HEARNS: I wanna, I wanna fight now. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!
TRUMP: Man, he did, he—could he fight. He was a natural. He had the greatest—he had hips a little bit smaller than mine. He had shoulders a little bit larger than mine. See, he went in the right proportion. That's the way it's supposed to be, right? Thank you, Tommy. They love him in Detroit, right? They love him in Detroit. [cheers and applause]
Another man that they love in Detroit is a rapper and he's one of the hottest in the world, actually. Trick Trick. Where's Trick Trick. Trick Trick. Come here, Trick Trick. Come here. Maybe we should have him do a little rapping or something, huh? Come here. Look at him. He looks good. He looks good. You look good.
TRICK TRICK: What up now, Detroit! [cheers and applause]
If y'all know about Trick Trick, y'all know I'm about bringing it all to Detroit. So please welcome the 47th President of the United States, as we make Detroit great again. [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Thank you very much. That's great.
You have some great people here, I'll tell you. This is a great place.
We are going to really make—We are. We're going to make it great again. Like the country, and we did it, and then we have to do it again because they blew it. They blew it to hell. But we're going to do it again. Thank you, Trick Trick.
Here are some of the facts on Kamala Harris. After talking to The Hitman and Trick Trick, it seems boring getting back into Kamala, but that's what we got to do. We got to save our country, right?
Mr. Wall. Mr. Wall, stand up please. This guy is great. You know he's a wealthy guy. He made a lot of money. He comes to—How many would you say? You're at 350 or something? He's got a lot. This guy's got lots of cash and I love his—Someday, I'm going to wear one of them to a rally.
Actually, I think it would be well-received because we built 571 miles of wall, we had it made, we were going to build another 200 miles of wall, and then they decided to sell it for five cents on the dollar. But we're going to get it done. We built much more than I said I was going to build.
And we had the safest border in the history of our country. By the way, my all-time favorite graph, can we put it up? [cheers and applause]
That's my all-time favorite. Illegal immigration saved my life, if you think about it. [laughter] But that arrow in the bottom, that's when I left office. That was the lowest point of illegal immigration, and that included drugs and uh so many other things. It was just everything. But it was also—They dealt with so many different elements of different forms of crime, the people that were coming in. And look what happened after that. Look at that. So that was me. That was me in the last day, and then you look, it was like a rocket ship. It was like Elon Musk set the rocket ship up and that was loaded up with criminals of the worst kind. And that's what we have now in our country.
And it's worse than that, because that one, I want to keep it just the way it was. I'm not going to change it at all. But the numbers on the right, they continue for a long time. It's just an amazing thing. But we love that piece of paper. We love that chart more than any. I sleep with it. I kiss it every night. [cheers and applause]
I do have that throbbing feeling in my right ear, throbbing feel. But that's okay. That's great. Thank you very much.
So that was the best in history. That was the best in recorded history, anyway. That was the lowest. It was the day I left office, they had human trafficking at a level, the lowest level. Now it's about 12 times. Sorry, and they traffic in women, they traffic not, I mean in children, but they traffic in women more than any other thing. It's a horrible, you wouldn't even believe it could be possible. So thank you very much. I just wanted to see if you had that. I looked to the right and a lot of things happened.
And you know, we went to Butler a few weeks ago and we had a celebration. 101,000 people showed up. 101,000. Butler, Pennsylvania, 101,000 people showed up and it was a beautiful tribute to Corey, the great firefighter. [cheers and applause]
He was a great guy, a big, big Trump fan, and two other wonderful gentlemen were really hurt badly. They thought they were not going to make it and the doctors did an unbelievable job, and they're getting better and better and better. But that's a rough thing. That was some evening, I will tell you. But what was really something, and we had an opera singer that was so incredible, right? We had an opera singer that was incredible. We had the Belles of Notre Dame. Now, they were recorded. We tried bringing them over, but they wouldn't let us do that. But we had a moment of silence. Then the bells rang and then the opera singer sang, and we had Ave Maria by Pavarotti. We had a whole night. It was an unbelievable tribute. It was a tribute to him. 101,000 people.
Kamala Harris is a radical left Marx, is rated even worse than Bernie Sanders and even worse than Pocahontas. Does anyone know Pocahontas? The great Pocahontas, they said, ""You should never use that term. Please apologize.""
I said, ""I'd like to apologize to the real Pocahontas for—"" [cheers and applause]
Kamala destroyed our border. She destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of Defund the Police movement. [booing] Anybody that wants to defund the police even for one day, we don't want them. They're not worthy of being the President of the United States. If you have that ideology, and she does, she's a Marxist, communist, fascist, anything you want.
Remember, I said we will never be a socialist country? Remember I said that? I'd said, ""We will not be a socialist country."" [cheers and applause]
And I was right. We skipped socialism, we went down to communism. So I was right. I like to be right. I was right for the wrong reasons, right?
Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE. These are the greatest people. They're tough, they're smart, and they love our country and they take people out that nobody else wants to touch. I have some friends in the front row, they're very tough. They're not doing it. They said, we'll pass. And she wants to get rid of them. She wants to get rid of ICE. She wants to ban fracking, and as California Attorney General, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon, and rape of an unconscious person as nonviolent crimes. She pledged, think of that, she pledged to confiscate your guns. Would anybody like to give up their guns? She wants to confiscate.
CROWD: NO
TRUMP: You feel a little safer when you have all these criminals. Think of it. They allow hundreds of thousands of prisoners to come into our country. Some are murderers, some are drug dealers. They come in and then they say, ""By the way, we're taking away your guns also,"" right? They don't go, ""Would anybody like to volunteer to give up your guns? Please raise your hand.""
Oh, we have a one guy. I think I have a feeling he won't be doing it when they—
CROWD MEMBER: [inaudible].
TRUMP: Thank you very much.
CROWD MEMBER: [inaudible].
TRUMP: Good, thank you. Sit down. That's enough.
He's our friend, but that's enough.
And endorsed a total ban on handgun ownership. She wants to endorse a ban, a big one. She already did. She even called for free sex changes for illegal aliens in detention. How about that one?[booing]
And most importantly of all, she lied about working at McDonald's. That's not a big thing, but can I be honest with you? It's terrible.
But there is a video, we talk about woke and they want to take us woke. And we have a video that I think you'll enjoy. It's about when we won two World Wars, when we were the, although we did defeat ISIS in about four weeks. I will tell, we have a great, a great military, but I think you'll enjoy this. The way it used to be and the way it is right now.

TRUMP: Pretty cool, right? We won two World Wars. Remember that. We won plenty of others and we defeated ISIS so rapidly nobody can believe it, in a matter of weeks. They said it was going to take five years. We did it in a matter of weeks.
In conclusion, with your vote this November, we are going to fire Kamala and we are going to save America. [cheers and applause]
We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always cherish our great American flag. We will cut your taxes, crush inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages, and create the greatest job boom the world has ever seen. We're going to do that very easily. Very easily. We will hire American, buy American, build American, grow American, and show the whole world that the American dream is back bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. [cheers and applause]
I will stop the—Absolutely darling. And I will stop the global theft of American jobs and turn the US into the manufacturing superpower of the world. I will end the war in Ukraine immediately. I will get it done while I'm President-elect. Stop the chaos in the Middle East and prevent World War III. We are very close to World War III. [cheers and applause] We are very, very close to World War III, because we have incompetent people. Ukraine would've never happened. October 7th would've never happened. Inflation would've never happened. It was caused by their stupid energy policy.
None of this stuff would've happened and we wouldn't have had that horrible situation in Afghanistan. The most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. 13 dead soldiers, many people dead, many people and soldiers just devastated, loss of legs and arms. All of that wouldn't have happened. And of course, we gave them tens of billions of dollars worth of brand new military equipment that I bought, I bought and they gave it away to the Taliban. I think it was the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. And because of that, Putin said, ""This is a paper tiger. I'm going to go into Ukraine.""
But he would've never done it if I were President. And even the Democrats admit that frankly, I will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources, and respect that they so dearly, they so dearly deserve. [cheers and applause]
We will strengthen and modernize our military. You know, I rebuilt our military, we rebuilt our military, but we're going to bring it to a next step. We will build a missile defense shield, all made in the USA, a lot of it made right here. And we will put these Stars and Stripes on the surface of Mars, and maybe with the help of Elon, we'll get it done quickly. [cheers and applause]
We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington, DC, making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. We will, remember this one, we will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools. [cheers and applause] It'll be gone. And we will keep men out of women's sports.
I will defend religious liberty, your right to free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will do that. [cheers and applause] Second Amendment.
After years and years of building up other countries, we will protect our borders, defend our families, and protect our American suburb, cities, and towns like never before. We will end sanctuary cities and we will stop illegal immigration once and for all. We will put American citizens first. We will put American citizens first, American children first, American patients first. Our American taxpayers first, American workers first, and American communities first. [cheers and applause]
And we will put communists, Marxists, and fascists last if that's okay. And they will always be last. They will never make a comeback. They're getting very close. We've got to win this election or they're going to be there. They're going to be there. We will not be invaded. We will not be occupied. We will not be conquered. And we will be a strong, proud, and free nation once again. We will defend our civilization, reclaim our sovereignty, and I will give you back your freedom, your future, and your life.
Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda once and for all. We want a landslide. And it looks like that could be happening, too big to risk. [cheers and applause]
Early voting is underway. So get everyone you know and go out and vote. Go tomorrow. It's just starting. Go and vote. Make sure you vote and bring all our friends that want to vote for us. Tell him, ""Jill, get your fat husband off the couch. Get that fat pig off the couch. Tell him to go and vote for Trump. He's going to save our country.""
Get that guy the hell off our—Get him up, Jill, slap him around. Get him up. Get him up, Jill, we want him off the couch to get out and vote. Bring your friends and get them out. After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge. And this is true. I really believe this, we're on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of our country.
With your help from now until election day. We're talking about 19 days. 19. We will redeem America's promise and we will take back the nation that we love. We have to take it back, because we've lost it. We've lost it. Nothing will sway us, nothing will slow us, and no one will stop us. We will press forward to our magnificent American destiny and together we will fight, fight, fight and vote, vote, vote. And we will win, win, win. We're going to win, win, win.
And November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country.
And together we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. [cheers and applause]
We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. [cheers and applause]
We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. [cheers and applause]
And we will make America great again. [cheers and applause]
Thank you and God bless you all. God bless you. Thank you everybody. [cheers and applause]

    [music: Lee Greenwood, ""God Bless the USA""]
TRUMP: Hello, everybody. Hello, Pennsylvania. We love Pennsylvania, that are very special. Hello to Latrobe. Oh, I love Latrobe. You know why? The home of Arnold Palmer. This was the home of my friend, Arnold Palmer, and he loved Latrobe. He turned out to be one of the greatest golfers in the world. He started off very, very poor. He had no money, just had a lot of talent and a lot of muscle. He was a strong guy. And his father worked at Latrobe golf course, and he was a laborer there. Actually they called him in those days sod carrier. He's a very strong man. He carried sod. They didn't have trucks that trucked it. They had strong people carrying. He was the strongest of them all. And he had a son, but they had no money. And he worked at Latrobe, and they treated him good because he could do more work than anybody else.
And his son had started to grow up and he realized his son was very strong like him, but he never had a chance to play golf. He had no money at all. And his son was named Arnold. And when Arnold was four and five years old, they had no money to buy a club. He couldn't buy one club, not one. And they used to go to the back of—This was all told to me by Arnold, so I have it firsthand. They used to go to the back room where the members were and they took out members' clubs and they'd use the members' clubs, two or three of them at night, late at night. And he hit balls with his son and he'd watch his son's every move. And he realized his son had great talent. And then his son got older and stronger, and then he got stronger and stronger.
And his father started saying, ""Wow, this is really crazy, what's going on with this kid."" And finally he was able to save up enough money to get him some clubs, but they weren't strong enough. Arnold was breaking them. He'd swing a regular club and it'd break the hell out of it because he was so powerful. And they went back to the members' bags because they couldn't afford another set and used very stiff shafted clubs, very strong for those of you that aren't golfers. That's for good golfers with power, very stiff shafted. And he'd get better and better. And then he went to high school and he won all sorts of championships, one after another. He'd beat the rich kids, he'd kill them. He'd beat them so badly. He loved beating them, even though he was a nice guy but he was tough. He was a tough cookie, Arnold.
I got to know him really well, and he'd beat them over and over again. And then he got a set of clubs and he got even better. And he won every championship. And he got into Wake Forest. You know that, right? Wake Forest. And he was immediately, as a freshman, the captain of the team. And there was a man named Mark McCormick. And Mark McCormick founded IMG. That's a very big—one of the biggest entertainment companies in the world today. And he wanted to be a professional golfer. He didn't go to Wake Forest, he went to another college, another school, and I won't say which, because honestly I didn't want to look it up. It wasn't worth it, but a good golf college. And he wanted to be a pro. He was a very good golfer, very, very good. And he had the privilege of playing Arnold Palmer in a match between Wake Forest and his college.
And the way he tells it, he was playing fantastically well, Mark McCormick, a very famous man actually, founder of the biggest entertainment company. And he was playing very well, playing Arnold. Arnold, Arnold was just Arnold. He was just better than anybody else in college. And somebody shouted over to Mark McCormick, ""How are you playing?"" He said, ""I'm playing great. Can't play better."" ""How are you doing?"" ""I'm six down."" And he realized at the end of that match that he would never be a pro because he could never beat a guy like this. It wasn't close. He said, ""He was longer, straighter, chipped better, putted better, and thought better. Other than that, they were very close."" But he gave it up. He said, ""I'm not going to be a golfer,"" but he went to Arnold. He said, ""Arnold, you're going to be turning pro and you're going to make a lot of money. And my second choice was to start representing people that are talented and I'd like you to be my first client.""
And they made a deal where Arnold owned a big piece of the company and Arnold started winning immediately, started winning immediately, made a lot of money for him. And Mark McCormick became the agent. And then because of Arnold's success, IMG, which most of you know, it's very, very big now, Hollywood stars, everything, IMG became well-known. And he started signing a lot of other players and a lot of other people. And then he started with Hollywood and they signed Hollywood stars. And it became the biggest of those companies like William Morris and all of them. And it was all because of Arnold. Arnold owned a big piece of it. Arnold was a very rich man. And I said to Arnold—I got to know him when he was 69 years old.
And I played pretty much with him, a lot of them. And as he got older—When you get older, you start to lose a thing called distance. And I'm a good golfer. Not like that but I'm a good golfer. And I felt so good because I was hitting it a little bit longer than Arnold. But he was by this time about 75, 76, and I'd hit it four or five yards past him. I said, ""Arnold, let me ask you, 30 years ago, 40 years ago, was I longer than you?"" He said, ""Donald—"" I wasn't president or close at that time. That was long before I decided to have this fun. [cheers and applause]
CROWD MEMBER: PA LOVES YOU!
TRUMP: But you're talking about a great man. I said, ""Arnold—"" And he was still plenty long, but I said, ""Arnold, do you think I was longer than you like I am now 30, 40 years ago?"" He goes, ""Donald, let me tell you a little secret. You weren't even close."" [laughing] He said, ""You see that tree out there?"" He pointed to a tree that was about 70 yards in front of us. He said, ""That's where I would drive it. And you're about 70 yards short of that tree. You would've been even worse then."" And it's true. He won, I think it was Pine Valley, one of the great courses. He won the US Open. He drove a par four, only person ever to drive that hole until that time. He drove it in a playoff, to win the playoff. He went over the trees, very risky shot.
He ended up driving the green and he won with a birdie in the hole. And nobody till that point had done anything like it. But I said to Arnold—He became very rich because of the investments and the IMG and all of the different things. And I said to Arnold, ""Just out of curiosity, you could live anywhere in the world. You could live on the Pacific Ocean, you could live on the Atlantic Ocean, you could live anywhere in the world. Why did you choose to stay?"" And part of the beauty is that because he made money right away—A lot of times it takes a pro years before they start making the money. It's a very, very difficult sport actually. But he started right away making money, and you know, the first thing he bought was Latrobe Golf Club. And you know the first thing he did? He took his father from a laborer to make him the course superintendent.
How cool is that? And then ultimately his father became the manager of the club. And Arnold was so proud, and his father was good. He said, ""One thing with my father, nobody's going to steal on me."" He said that. And I said that too. I said, ""There's something nice."" And then I took Arnold when he was quite old in all fairness—We took a helicopter from where he was in Florida to Doral. I own Doral, which is a great place. And it's got four courses, many championships. Many of the best championships were at Doral. And I was building these beautiful—They call them villas, about 88 units in each one, hotel villas. And I named them after the 10 greatest golfers, including like Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Slammin' Sammy Snead, all great players. And I said, ""Arnold, I really want to name one after you. Would you like it?""
He said, ""I'd love it. I'd be honored to have that."" And we flew down for the opening ceremony to cut a ribbon for the Arnold Palmer Villa. And it's to this day, people just love it. And I'll never forget the day, he was having a little hard time. [applause] He was a little older. He hit the eighties. He hit the eighties, but when he got up there, he had that magic like nobody had. And there were a few golfers that could—You could say maybe slightly better, a few, not many, but there was nobody that had his magic. He was a thriller. He was unbelievable. He knew how to win and he knew how to just do whatever it was that electrified a crowd. If I had him here right now with me, this crowd would be going absolutely crazy.
They'd say, ""Trump, get off the stage. We want Arnold Palmer to speak."" He would electrify a crowd and he would go for shots that nobody else would do and they were risky as hell. And sometimes it wouldn't work out, but usually it did with him. He was an incredible man. He was an incredible champion. And he came from Latrobe. And so when I said—A couple of days ago, I said, ""Where are we going to be today?"" They said, ""Sir, we're going to be at Latrobe."" I said, ""Do you know what that means?"" ""No, sir. What does it mean?"" I said, ""That means Arnold Palmer,"" because Arnold told me he could be, and I knew he could be. They wanted him everywhere. Just like I wanted to name a villa after him. Everybody wanted him. He could have been in any place he wanted.
He said, ""No, this is where I want to be. This is the place I love. I mean, how good is that, right? And he died a very proud owner of this course. And he was always tinkering with it. I said, ""Arnold, what are you doing?"" He said, ""Well, I'm moving the whole four yards back."" I said, ""Nobody knows the difference, Arnold."" He said, ""I don't care. I love it. I love this place."" He could not get enough of Latrobe. So I've been here before, and I told the story before, not in this kind of detail, because you have these teleprompters. If I would read it off a teleprompter, it wouldn't be so good, right? And it would be a lot shorter. It wouldn't be as good. And I didn't want to do that. I said, ""When I come here, I'm going to tell them the real story of Arnold.""
But Arnold Palmer was all man. And I say that in all due respect to women, and I love women, but this guy, this is a guy that was all man. [cheers and applause] This man was strong and tough. And I refuse to say it, but when he took showers with the other pros, they came out there, they said, ""Oh my God, that's unbelievable."" [laughing] I had to say it. We have women that are highly sophisticated here, but they used to look at Arnold, this is bad, but he was really something special. Arnold was something special. So I just want to tell you, you're very lucky, the people that live in Latrobe, and it's an honor for me to be here because of him. Actually, he was a great man. And I don't think there would be golf—To the extent that you have it today, it probably wouldn't be that way without the great Arnold Palmer. So enjoy it, everybody. [cheers and applause]
And I had to tell you the shower part of it because it's true. What can I tell you? We want to be honest. We want to be upfront. It's true. But I'm thrilled to be back in this incredible Commonwealth with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. I'd like to begin by asking a question. Are you better off now than you were four years ago?
CROWD: NO!
TRUMP: After living through this nightmare of inflation, invasion, and humiliation? You know what the invasion is, right? Invasion by the southern border. What they've done to our country is unbelievable, allowing more than 21 million people into our country. Many of them are murderers, many of them are drug dealers, and they're from mental institutions. He says, ""Send the back."" You right. Do you come from the drug business? Yeah, he does. But Americans are ready to be free from Kamala Harris.
Do you know that whenever I use the word Harris, everybody says, ""Who's Harris?"" They have no idea who Harris is. That's true. They have no idea who's Harris but Kamala—And to reclaim the future that is rightfully yours, you're going to reclaim it. This election is a choice between whether we will have a incredible four more years of failure, such a horrible four years. Everything they touched turns to—
CROWD: SHIT!
TRUMP: Everything, inflation, Afghanistan—How about Afghanistan? Most embarrassing moment in the history of—[booing] Everything they've touched. Even now, he's telling Israel—Everything he said to Israel was exactly the opposite. He's the greatest—I will say this about Biden. He's the single greatest expert on foreign policy in history. You know what that means? If you did the exact opposite of what he suggested every single time, you'd go down as the greatest foreign policy president in history, if you did the exact opposite. [cheers and applause] Everything's a failure.
And he's telling Bibi, Netanyahu, ""Don't do this. Don't do that. Don't do this. All our great congressmen are there. Don't do any of these things."" And Bibi didn't listen to him. And I tell you what, they're in a much stronger position now than they were three months ago, that's for sure. Nobody's ever seen anything like this happen. And Bibi called me today and he said, ""It's incredible what's happened."" I said, ""It's pretty incredible."" But he wouldn't listen to Biden because if he did, they wouldn't be in this position. And she's worse than him. She's not as smart as him. And I'm not saying he's the smartest. I'm not saying he's the smartest, but she's not as smart as him. And I think maybe you know, based on early results, maybe he'd be doing better than her. We have results coming out where we actually now don't have to rely on the polls.
We are doing good on the polls, but we don't have to rely on the polls. Remember, they stole the election from an American president. They stole it. I could say—I don't even want to call it, they just stole the election. They said, ""We're taking the election away."" He got 14 million votes and he won. 22 people running, 22 Democrats, they're running. I'm looking at my hair up there. Let's see. [laughing] I don't like it. I don't like it. Excuse me, I'm going to recomb my hair. Do you mind? I'll leave the stage for five minutes. I'm going to recomb my hair, Mr. Future Senator. We have David down here, Mr. Future Senator. You've got to get him in. [cheers and applause]
You're doing good too. Well, let's keep it the way it is. Let's just keep going, right? We'll trudge through it. But this election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of failure and disaster. And that's what it's been. It's been failure. We're disrespected all over the world. They're laughed at all over the world. They're laughing at him and they're laughing at her. The other night, they had Catholic charities. They had the most—the biggest event, the Al Smith Dinner. It's the biggest event of the year for Catholics. [cheers and applause] And she's the only one in years, decades that didn't show up. She didn't show up. She wouldn't be there. [booing]
She wouldn't be there. She said no, and she ended up doing a tape that was pathetic and it was an insult to Catholics frankly because she was actually sort of knocking them or knocking religion. Then she had the other event the other day where she said, ""You're in the wrong location,"" when they started talking about a certain subject, which basically was a knock on Christianity and a knock on religion because she doesn't know what the hell she's saying. But they had been a failure. It's been a disaster. Or you're going to have four years and they will be the four greatest years in the history of our country if we make the proper decision. You've got to make that decision. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!
TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you very much. By the way, if you're Catholic, you can't vote after that and you can't vote for another reason. That administration has been persecuting Catholics. It's been persecuting Catholics. I don't know why. Persecuting a lot of people. Persecuting politicians. I'll raise my hand, but we're kicking their ass. They are bad. They are bad. They are bad. Guys going to jail. They've never done this. This has never happened. It happens in third-world countries, in Banana Republics. They go after—It's called weaponization. They weaponize their justice departments. I call it the Department of Injustice. Ours is the Department of Injustice, but we're doing well. We won the big case in Florida. You saw that? [cheers and applause] That was the big one. That was the big one. That was the big one.
""They're going to get him on that one. Oh, they're going to get him."" We had a judge who was brilliant and fair and very smart. She ruled against them, very strongly against them. These are dishonest people that we're dealing with, but we won that. And we have other ones. We have them on the ropes. Remember, they were going to have me in oh such a trouble. I'm going to be in trouble. And in the meantime, it's just weaponization of government. That made me more popular. It actually made me more popular, I think. That's crazy. [cheers and applause]
Because people can see, and they're smart, and we could sometime explain it, but one after another—You had Fani, F-A-N-I, [booing] which is usually pronounced Fanny, and she added a little action to it, Fah-ni [sic]. That was a scam. They're all scams. They're all scams. It's a corrupt system, and it's a corrupt justice department, and it's a corrupt DA, corrupt Attorney Generals. They use it to get elected because you can't get elected with open borders, with transgender operations all over the place, with men playing in women's sports, [booing] with high taxes and banned schools. No school choice. You can't get elected with all—I could go on for 10 minutes.
CROWD MEMBER: World War 3.
TRUMP: Your vote will decide whether we give up on America or whether we save America. It is the most important election you're ever going to have. [cheers and applause] Really is. By the way, how nice is this place? Isn't it beautiful? [cheers and applause] Look, people, as far as you can see, they give you a little extra security nowadays, you notice? [laughing] Hey, I got more machine guns than I've ever seen in—Look at these guys. I got more machine—
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: I never saw guns like that. I said to my son, Don—He knows a lot about guns, and Eric knows a great shot. They really understand. I said, ""What kind of a gun is that?"" They said, ""Dad, you don't even want to know."" They are serious guns. We've got more guys and everyone who's like central casting too. Holy shit, I'm looking. They look like Arnold Palmer. They look like Arnold. Can't look better than Arnold. But with your support, we'll bring back our nation's strength, dominance, prosperity, and pride. We're going to do it. This will be America's new golden age. 100 years from now, the presidential election of 2024 will be looked upon as America's greatest victory. [cheers and applause] I hope that's true because we've been through so much together, and the finish line is finally in sight. After four horrendous years, Kamala Harris can't say one thing that she'd do differently.
Right? You heard that. If you vote for me, I will end inflation, I will bring jobs back to our country. We'll flood—we'll flood our shores with companies and jobs. We'll seal our borders immediately and we'll let people in. We had the safest border in the history of our country. Hold it, put up my favorite sign of all time, put up my favorite graph. I have to use it, my favorite graph. [cheers and applause] So the red arrow on the bottom, that's the lowest number of illegal immigrants to come into this country. And by the way, we want people to come into the country, but they have to come in legally just so we understand, right? She's going, ""Yeah."" We want it, we need them because we're going to need them because we're going to have so many companies come in just through adjustments in tariffs and taxes. They're going to come pouring into our country, and they're going to stay here because we're going to protect them with tariffs.
The word tariff is the most beautiful word in the dictionary. More beautiful than love. More beautiful than respect. No, less beautiful than religion, though. I don't want to get into that argument, but the word tariff is the most beautiful word in the dictionary. Remember that. It's going to make our country rich and our politicians were too stupid for so many years or something else was going on. [gesturing to crowd member] He goes, ""Crooked."" That could be. Because it's so simple to understand, but look at that. So that was the day I left office, that lower red arrow. [gesturing to screen] That's the lowest point. And look what happened to our country after that. [booing] Look at that.
And that was done by Border Patrol, which we love. Oh, by the way, Border Patrol gave us their total and complete endorsement, and it's hard. [cheers and applause] They're not actually supposed to do it. They said, ""Well, let them take all 29,000 of us and let's see what happens to this country."" No, they're not—In theory, you work for the government. They couldn't help. And they said, ""She's horrible."" They said, ""She's horrible."" It wasn't just—They said, ""You're the greatest president in the history of our country."" Some only said, ""The greatest in our lifetime."" They had a unanimous endorsement from everybody. And they said at the same time, ""She's the worst we've ever had by far."" And now she's running. And I tell you, I think that the border—I was just saying to Byron Donald in the plane. Right, Byron? I was just in up, Byron, what a great guy. [cheers and applause]
Look at that black hat. So you know what? You know who the founder of that hat is? Elon. Elon Musk. He wore it. He's like the founder. We sell that. I think we sell about two a year. Now it's the hottest hat we have. And Elon came up—Elon Musk gave us his total endorsement. How good is that? [cheers and applause] He's the one that landed that rocket. That rocket came in. I said, ""That sucker is not going to make it."" I was actually on the phone talking to somebody. It was crazy. And I'm talking to this person and I'm saying, ""Wait a minute. Something's happening. I got to hold. Just hold it."" I put the phone—And it was a very important person. I just—I'm looking at something on the screen. I'm seeing this 24 story tube come down, and it looked like it was getting—Congressman, it looked like it was getting a little bit close to the gantry, or whatever the hell they call that nowadays. I said, ""Oh my God."" And I put the phone down. Very important person, by the way.
I won't tell you who, it'll be embarrassing, because I never picked up the phone again. I was sitting there for—And because I was the president and because I'm leading, which is probably more important to him, the guy didn't hang up. He was on the phone, forty-five, fifty minutes waiting. I just saw, ""Oh, the phone's off the hook. Hello, hello."" And he went—But I saw this thing come down, this tube, this giant tube, and I put the phone, I said, ""Just a second."" I said, ""I don't believe it,"" because I had the sound off. I turned the sound up and it came down and I said, ""It's going to crash. Don't crash."" Actually, at first, I thought it was like a movie or something. I never saw this before, and I've seen a lot. And it came down and it was going into—And then all of a sudden you see the fire pouring out of the left side, pushed it over. It landed perfectly, and then it was grabbed by two claws, two giant claws, and they grabbed it like Willie Mays would catch a fly ball in center field, right?
That's the way it was. He was pretty good, Willie. And they came down and I called Elon. I said, ""Elon, is that you?"" He said, ""That was me."" I said, ""Can anyone else do that?"" ""No."" ""Can the United States do it?"" ""No."" "" Can Russia do it, China do it?"" ""No, nobody can do that."" He said, ""They're 10 years behind."" This guy is great. And he said, ""If Donald Trump doesn't win, it could be the end of democracy in our country, it could be the end of our country."" And you know where he is today? He's in another part of the Commonwealth. Never ever make the mistake of calling it a state, by the way. It could be career ending. I had a friend that did that, a politician. He used to be a politician. It shouldn't be that big a deal because a lot of people make that mistake. That's one I could understand somebody making, but we call it the Commonwealth.
But Elon endorsed me. He's in another part of the Commonwealth, and he's campaigning now, and he's got—Actually, he's got a gold. He's got a gold cap, but he called it. He was wearing the black hat in Butler, Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] We had 101,000 people, Butler, honoring Cory, the fire fighter. Butler, Pennsylvania, we had 101,000 people. It was unbelievable. What a night that was. And we were honoring Cory and two gentlemen who were very badly hurt. We thought they weren't going to make it, the doctors up there. They have good doctors. These are good doctors. I don't know if they call them country doctors, but whoever they are, they were good because these were two men that were not the two great supporters who were not supposed to make it. And they made it. And they made it. They'll be okay. But Cory didn't make it.
And we honored Cory. It was the most beautiful evening. We had a moment of silence, and then we had the bells of Notre Dame, right? Notre Dame playing. And then we had an opera singer who sounded just like Pavarotti. I mean, the guy was unbelievable, and he sang Ave Maria, and our whole place was crying. It was crazy. I'm looking at the audience. Some of my friends were there, almost as tough as the football players that we have. We have some of the great football players. [cheers and applause] Almost as tough. I don't know if you guys did, but they were tough cookies, and I see them crying. They're trying to be cool. ""No, I wasn't crying,"" but the whole place was crying. It was amazing. It was 101,000 people.
So we will regain our sovereignty, we'll restore our safety, and we will unlock the magnificent destiny that is just within our reach. And I am asking you to be excited about the future of our country. Again, you're going to be excited. [cheers and applause] This is going to be the most exciting period ever. Every problem facing us can be solved, but now the fate of our nation is in your hands. It really is. I mean, if you put these lunatics in charge any longer, we can't take it any longer. They're laughed at. They're laughed at by foreign leaders. They think we're—They can't even believe it. They can't even believe it. Biden can't find his way off a platform. She's worse. I wonder if she's going to have any trouble. No, she should be probably okay in that regard. But she's worse up here.
Pennsylvania, you have to stand up and you have to tell Kamala Harris, who shouldn't be there, she shouldn't be. She's a threat to democracy. The way they took over. They called me a threat to democracy, right? She's a threat to democracy because she shouldn't even be the candidate. They should have picked a candidate fairly, not just given her because they want to be politically correct. [cheers and applause]
I mean, whether you like him or not, you know, we had the debate, and his numbers went down. He didn't have a good night, but that can happen. But that happens. And the numbers go down. And they went down, and they went into them. They said, ""We're not going to let you run. We're going to take it away."" That's crazy. Nancy went in, Chuck Schumer went in. Some of the people went in. They took it away from him. They just took it away from him. It's bad. And that is a threat to democracy if you think about it, right? That's a real threat to democracy.
But you have to tell Kamala Harris—
CROWD MEMBER: You're fired.
TRUMP: And by the way, I think he would've—Let's see what happens. And I may be wrong, but let's see what happens. I think he might've done better than she's going to do because all we had to do is expose her as a lunatic left, further left than Pocahontas. Do you know who Pocahontas? [laughing] Elizabeth Warren. She's further left than Pocahontas, and I don't want to get into that stuff, but her mother said she was Indian because she had high cheekbones. That's what she said.
And then she went out and did a test because I was driving her crazy, calling her Pocahontas. So she fell for the trap, and she did a test, and she was so happy, because it came back 1,014th, remember? 1,014th, and that was it. That means I had more Indian blood in me than she had, and I have none. I have none. I'd like to have some. I would like to have some. I'd be honored, but I have more, and I have none. But she was so happy when she got—Think of that. That was what happened. That was the end of her career. That was the end of her presidential run.
She was leading for the president. And when she said—And you got to understand, just these are the people we're dealing with, she took that Indian heritage and based on the fact, and this is her statement. This is not me. There's no racist anything in me, not a drop, but this is not me. Her mother told her this, that she had high cheekbones, and therefore she was part Indian. And based on that, she applied to colleges. She applied for jobs, she applied for the US Senate, and everyone's forgotten that crap right now, but I never forget it.
But she went out, and she had the test, and the test was ridiculous, basically. And then I said that I have more than she does, and I would love to. I will tell you, but she's bad news. But she's radical, left crazy. She drives people—What she does to business people is horrible. She's a horrible person, but she's radical left and crazy. Bernie is radical left. And this one, Kamala, is further left than them. So you have to tell Kamala Harris that you've had enough, that you just can't take it anymore. We can't stand you. You are a shit Vice President. [cheers and applause] The worst. You're the worst Vice President. Kamala, you're fired. Get the hell out of here. You're fired. Get out of here. Get the hell out of here, Kamala. [cheers and applause]
Early voting in Pennsylvania is now underway. Go and vote. Just go and vote. Get out there. And if you've not registered to vote, you only have two days left. You have to get out there and register immediately. Does everybody promise they're going to register? Okay? [cheers and applause] Boy, look at the crowd. Wow. Wow. Hello, everybody. How did the flyover look? [cheers and applause] Good? Good. It feels like you're very close to the ground. I said, ""Are we okay here?"" It looks like okay from here, but let me tell you, you're in that plane, that sucker feels low. I'm saying, ""I hope everything's working nicely on that plane."" With your help, 17 days from now, we are going to win Pennsylvania. We're going to defeat Kamala Harris, and we are going to make America great again, right? [cheers and applause]
CROWD: TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!
TRUMP: And I'm in big trouble tonight. You know why Franklin Graham wrote me. You heard this. Like two months ago. He said, ""President, we love your stories. We love your speaking. We love everything about you. You're a great Christian. We love everything about you, but sir, please, please don't use any bad language, bad words."" He said, ""Your stories will even be better."" And I wrote them back. I said, ""I'm going to try and do that, but actually the stories won't be as good."" Because you can't put the same emphasis on—So tonight I broke my rule. I've done it for weeks, but tonight I just said, ""Look, I'm in Pennsylvania. What the hell?"" [cheers and applause] What the hell? I went to school here. I went to school. I went to the great Wharton School of Finance here. What a great school that was too. What a great school. So if we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole damn thing, right? [cheers and applause]
And starting on day one of my new administration, I will end Kamala Harris' war on Pennsylvania energy because you know she's gonna ban fracking, right? A 100%. She was against fracking, against all this stuff, and then all of a sudden, about a year and a half ago when she was getting killed in the polls, she said, ""I like fracking very much."" Look, they always go back to what they want. They always go back. She can't help it. She's a radical left Marxist. She can't help it. But we're going to end that, and we will frack, frack, frack, and drill, baby, drill. [cheers and applause]
We're going to drill, baby, drill. We're going to be drilling so deep. We're going to be for these guys. We're going to drill. We're going to take out so much money. We're going to pay down our debt. We're going to lower your taxes. I gave you the largest tax cut in the history of our country and the biggest regulation cuts in the history of our country. And we had the best economy in the history of our country, and we had the best border in the history of our country.
Other than that, what the hell? I did other things too. I rebuilt the military, and unfortunately, they gave a lot of it away to the Taliban. [booing] These geniuses, these stupid people like Milley, General Milley. Remember his performance in Congress? General Milley and Mattis, all these guys, what a bunch of lightweights. But we have great generals, but they're the ones you don't see on television. They're the ones that actually have to fight. Like we defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate with great generals and great—We have a great military, but not the ones you see on television. Not the movie actors that you see. Kamala has said repeatedly, she wants to ban fracking, which would kill over 500,000 jobs in Pennsylvania alone. Watch this.
[start of video montage]
KAMALA HARRIS [montage of clips from Harris statements]: There's no question, I'm in favor of banning fracking. I'm committed to passing a Green New Deal, and finally putting an end to fracking once and for all. If they fail to act, as President of the United States, I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster to pass a Green New Deal. I am offering a Green New Deal that has been described as one of the most aggressive and progressive.
INTERVIEWER 1: He's going to bring the Green New Deal up for a vote.
HARRIS: Yeah, I will vote for it. It is a resolution. I believe that the underlying principles behind it are sound and important.
INTERVIEWER 2: What is the solution for voters who have jobs and interests in the fossil fuel industry?
HARRIS: Giving the workers an ability to transition into the jobs of the future.
INTERVIEWER 3: Can we afford it?
HARRIS: Of course we can afford it. It's not about cost.
[end of video] [booing]
TRUMP: So when she does that, that's the end of Pennsylvania as we know it. It's your most important, not only from the standpoint of 500,000 jobs, it's 500,000 jobs, but in terms of income for the state, you would have to double and triple your taxes to make up. And she's going to do it. She's going to do it. She's going to do it.
And you know, the other thing, the taxes. You know what an unrealized capital gain is? Okay? I'll tell you what it is, communism is what—So she wants to have a tax. So capital gains tax is terrible, it's rough, but you sell something, you can pay the tax. She wants an unrealized capital gain every year so that if something goes up in value, now you have to go out. It'll be a great business for appraisers and for lawyers and for accountants. Other than that, it's a disaster. She wants an unrealized, and she refuses to say that, ""No, we're not going to do that."" She refuses. Think of it. It's an unrealized gain. She wants that. So she wants to tax an unrealized gain. This woman is crazy.
I will terminate the Green New Scam immediately. It's the greatest scam in history. [cheers and applause] I'll stop the energy price hikes. I will rescind the natural gas export ban, which is killing your state, by the way, and we will have energy independence. We were energy independent four years ago. Think of it, energy independent. We're still going to be energy dominant, and I will cut your energy and electricity prices in half within 12 months of taking office, 50%. [cheers and applause] We have it. It's under our feet. We don't have to get it from Venezuela. We get it from Venezuela. The whole thing's not believable.
For most of American history, Pennsylvania was the commercial and industrial powerhouse of the United States, but year after year, globalist radical politicians and incompetents like Kamala Harris have waged a war on your Commonwealth. They've annihilated your steel mills, decimated your coal jobs, assaulted your oil and gas jobs, and sold off your manufacturing jobs to China and foreign nations all over the world.
Under the Trump administration, we are going to take back what is ours. We will end the looting and pillaging of Pennsylvania and many other states all over our country. We will bring back our manufacturing jobs, our energy jobs, our coal jobs, our steel jobs, and our dreams. [cheers and applause]
And it's all very simple. Starting in January, we will give our companies the lowest taxes, the lowest energy costs, the lowest regulatory burdens, and free access to the best and biggest market anywhere on the planet. But only if they make their products right here in America. If they don't, they have to pay a higher tariff and only if they hire American workers for the job, and they will. [cheers and applause] They'll all be coming. They'll be pouring in. If these companies don't make their product here, then they will pay a tariff when they send their products into the United States for the privilege of competing with our workers and our cherished companies. We're going to protect our workers and our company. It's all very simple. We don't do any of this now.
I was going to do it, and then COVID came, and I said, ""We got to fight that one."" We did a great job with that. I got great credit for the economy, for the military. We were in no wars. Think of it. I started no wars. Everybody thought I'd be in a war. I'll be in a war in two days. No, it didn't work out. My personality stopped wars. Stopped wars. It also, it stopped wars in countries that we weren't even involved. I was able to stop wars with other countries that we weren't even that involved with just by making a couple of phone calls. I saved a lot of lot of lives.
We will call this policy the ""Build It in America"" plan because when foreign leaders and CEOs call me up to complain about our tariffs, my answer will be very simple to them, ""Build it in America, build it in Pennsylvania."" We're going to build a lot. We're going to have all those hulks that you have all over the place, the big empty hulks that we have all over our country. They're going to be loaded up with companies. Honestly, they'll be ripped down, and you'll see modern buildings built, modern manufacturing built. The centerpiece of this plan will be a 15% made-in-America corporate tax rate, cutting the tax from 21% to 15, but again, only for those who make their product in the USA. [cheers and applause] And remember, I got it down to 21. Everyone said it would be impossible to get approved by Congress. I got it approved by Congress, but I got it down to 21. It was close to 40%. I got it down to 21%. Nobody thought that was possible. Now, I'm taking it from 21% down to 15%. The companies are going to roar in because 21% is very competitive. 15% is really, it's amazing.
I mean, companies are gonna want to be here, but they have to be protected from other companies coming in from the outside and raiding the jobs, the products. And that's what we're doing with the tariffs. And for those companies who don't make their product in America, they will be forced to pay a very stiff tariff. And we will make it and take it. Hundreds of billions of dollars are going to come in through tariff dollars to benefit American citizens, and we're going to pay off debt and reduce your taxes still further.
Again, I gave you the biggest tax cut in history. We'll be able to do it still further. And remember this, for decades, nobody paid. China never paid one penny, not one penny to us until I came along. They paid hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and taxes under me. Under Bush, under Obama, they never paid. They never paid anything, nothing, not a dime. Hundreds of billions of dollars they paid. And that's just the beginning.
We're a rich country, but we don't know how to be rich. We just don't know how to be. But we're going to be rich, and we're going to be richer than ever before. We're going to take care of ourselves. It's going to be America first. It's also going to be, we'll help the world. We want to help the world, but it's time that we take care of ourselves. We owe $36 trillion dollar. We're going to take care of ourselves first. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: And I will never apologize for defending America. I will protect our workers. I will protect our jobs. I will protect our borders. I will protect our families, and I will protect the birthright of our children to live in the richest and most powerful nation on the face of the Earth. [cheers and applause]
And I will also protect our steel industry. If you guys remember, we were going to lose our steel. We had the worst policy on steel. China was coming in and others, dumping steel onto our shores. And we would've had no steel industry left. And I put a tariff, a big tariff on all steel coming in. It was not good steel either. It was what we call dirty steel. It was bad steel, bad structurally, very dangerous, actually. But they were dumping steel into our country, destroying our steel mills. And I put a big tariff, and it all stopped. when I did that, it all stopped. And we took in hundreds of billions of dollars, and it all stopped.
And you know, we slashed foreign steel exports. All these exports that were pouring in, they stopped to the level of about 25%. Nobody could believe it. And I hadn't even started yet. We were just getting ready. We were going to make this country richer than it had ever been before. You know in the 1890s and 1880s, our country was actually the richest it ever was. They had to form committees to determine, how are we going to spend this vast wealth? We had so much wealth, relatively speaking, so much wealth, more than anybody by far. And they formed up blue ribbon committees. ""How are we going to spend the money? We don't know how to spend it."" Wouldn't that be a nice problem to have?
CROWD MEMBER: Yeah!
TRUMP: We were a tariff country. And McKinley was President. William McKinley was actually a great president, was assassinated, by the way. He was assassinated. Being president is a very dangerous profession. If you're an auto racer, you know how many people die? About one-tenth of 1%. If you're a bull rider, that's dangerous. That's more dangerous than playing in the NFL, right, fellas, what do you think? I think it's a little more. I don't know. It's pretty dangerous. We got a couple of big, big deals over here, but I think that bull riding stuff, that looks bad. One-tenth of 1% about the same as the auto racing.
If you're president, take a look, it's about 5%, 6%. That's a lot better. But it's only good if you want to do one thing. You want to make your country strong and wonderful and great, and that's what I'm doing. But it is a dangerous profession, and we can't let it be a dangerous profession. We have to have better everything.
Actually, we have to have better respect from countries that look at us because we have to let them—I'm still waiting for Biden to say, ""If you do anything to this guy that I hate, I hate Trump. But if you do anything to him, we're going to blow your country to pieces."" And then you wouldn't need all this glass up here. You wouldn't need all the glass.
And other presidents have said that. And even if it's your opponent, and even if it's somebody that helped them force you out of an election, which I didn't want to do, but you got to do that, regardless. Opponent or no opponent, you got to let a country know that you're going to play around, we're going to blow you to pieces, and then everything will stop. It'll be amazing. [cheers and applause]
But today I'm honored to receive the endorsement of three union locals representing US steel, Mon Valley. [cheers and applause] And if they want, I'd like to call them up to the stage, including union leaders, Brian Pavlak and Richard Tikey, and Jason Zugeis. Would you come on up here, fellas? These are good-looking people. Good-looking guy. Yeah. [Trump shakes hands and greets the union leaders as they come to the stage.]
UNION MEMBER: [inaudible].
TRUMP: Oh, yeah. You guys can say something too. Thank you. thank you very much. That's great.
UNION MEMBER: Pleasure.
TRUMP: [inaudible] yeah, yeah, it's pretty simple. It's pretty simple.
UNION MEMBER: Mr. President.
UNION MEMBER: It's an honor.
TRUMP: [inaudible].
UNION MEMBER: Pleasure to meet you. [inaudible].
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
UNION MEMBER: Thank you.
UNION MEMBER: Yes, you did. That's why we're here, buddy.
Donald Trump: Would somebody like to say something?
UNION MEMBER: Yeah.
TRUMP: Please, go ahead.
UNION MEMBER: Brian started our movement, President Trump.
Donald Trump: Good.
BRIAN PAVLAK: It's an honor to be on stage with you. All the steelworkers here, honor to be on stage with you. I was at the Butler rally when they tried to assassinate you. And I knew after that, that I had to do whatever I had to do, so the president that saved the steel industry with tariffs. You saved it with tariffs.
TRUMP: Thank you.
PAVLAK: And you're my hero, and you're the greatest president ever. [cheers and applause]
UNION MEMBER: We love you.
PAVLAK: We love you. So steelworkers for Trump and the rank-and-file Mon Valley works want to endorse you. We want to give you a hard hat [cheers and applause] and also another hat too. Well, thank you, President Trump.
UNION MEMBER: Thank you, it's such an honor.
TRUMP: Thank you. We're going to get a lot of-
UNION MEMBER: We love no tax on overtime. Yeah, no tax on overtime.
TRUMP: That's [inaudible]
UNION MEMBER: Yeah. You know the steelworkers work a lot of overtime.
Donald Trump: [inaudible].
UNION MEMBER: No, no.
UNION MEMBER: No child support in overtime.
TRUMP: That's another one.
UNION MEMBER: [inaudible] put the hard hat on.
UNION MEMBER: [inaudible].
PAVLAK: Could we get a picture with you?
TRUMP: Yeah, let's go. Come on. Let's do it real fast, guys. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. [Trump puts on hard hat. Cheers and applause.]
UNION MEMBER: Beautiful, beautiful.
TRUMP: Thank you, let's take a picture, come on. Got it?
UNION MEMBER: Got it.
TRUMP: They've got it outside. Okay, he's got it right there. [points to person in crowd]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Let's go. We gotta get back. Thank you.
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
UNION MEMBER: So awesome, thank you.
TRUMP: Thank you.
UNION MEMBER: Thank you. [union member takes selfie with Trump as it takes off the hard hat.]
TRUMP: Thank you very much. That's a lot of uh, lot of strength up here, a lot of great people, actually, Thank you very much, have a good time.
UNION MEMBER: Good luck, President Trump.
UNION MEMBER: Save our steel.
TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you very much. They said you did stay. We really did. We saved the steel industry in this country. Now we're going to make it really powerful again, along with autos. [cheers and applause] Great guys, great people. Those are great people. I'm also—and that have been beaten up for a lot of years unfairly because we had stupid politicians or corrupt politicians, I'm not sure which.
I'm also honored to have the overwhelming endorsement of the rank-and-file membership of the Teamsters. [cheers and applause] That never happened before, never happened before, never happened before. And also we have something else, the law enforcement. Virtually every group in the United States from law enforcement, every single group. The sheriffs, the police, the Fraternal Order, 400,000 police, they all endorsed me, so thank you very much. Thank you. [cheers and applause] I don't think she has one. She's a disaster. She want to defund. She was involved in defund the police. I think when you defund the police, that's the end of that.
With four more years of Kamala, Harris, Pennsylvania will be an economic wasteland. That's going to happen. And I'll tell you with me, you're going to make more money than they've ever made before. You're going to have the best salaries, the lowest taxes. You're going to be doing better than you ever did. And we're going to put this into motion fast. You can do it very fast. It's very simple too. Kamala's inflation has already cost the typical family over $30,000 in higher prices, and now she wants to raise typical family taxes by nearly $3,000 a year. Just take a look at this video please.
[start of video]
NARRATOR: Kamala Harris is going to significantly raise taxes.
HARRIS: Taxes are going to have to go up.
NARRATOR: Kamala's plan will raise families taxes by nearly $2,600 a year. Under Kamala, prices have already soared. Now she'd make it worse with even higher taxes.
HARRIS: Taxes are going to have to go up.
NARRATOR: President Trump will cut taxes again. No taxes on tips, overtime, or Social Security.
TRUMP: I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message.
[end of video]
TRUMP: You know what they said to me up here? ""We like the overtime the best."" I said, ""yeah, you probably—"" You like the overtime, right fellas? That's it. I figured you had something. That's right. You're not worried about the tips. You like that overtime, right? But a lot of people like the tips. And if you're a senior, you like—you know what you like. You want the Social Security, no tax on Social Security. Think of no tax. No tax on Social Security benefits for our seniors. And they deserve it because you know what? Inflation with their fixed income, mostly fixed income, inflation has absolutely destroyed our seniors and other people that are on fixed income. So I will also make interest on car loans fully tax-deductible. That's a big deal. [cheers and applause]
They said, one of the top guys on Wall Street called up and he said, ""We have an incredible situation here. Where did you come up with that?"" It's like the paperclip. I said it the other day, like 125 years ago, some guy took some steel and he bent it around a little bit. He came up with a paperclip and other people looked at it. He made a lot of money, very rich man. And they said, ""Why the hell didn't we think of it?"" You know, the one having to do with the deductibility of car loans, so simple. And the top guys on Wall Street, real geniuses, they called up. They said, ""How did you think of that? It's so simple."" But to have the American dream, you want to have a car, and I think this is going to be fantastic for Detroit and South Carolina and Tennessee and all of the areas that produce cars.
One thing I have to say, also. We have, in Mexico, and I've been talking about it for the last year and a half. China is getting ready to build massive car plants, massive, which would wipe out Michigan, would hurt you, but would wipe out Michigan. Detroit would be gone. And they're the biggest plants in the world. I have a friend that does that. He builds plants. He doesn't do anything else. All he wants to do is build plants. And I called him up a year ago, a little more than that. I said, ""I want to see a plant. I want to go see a plant."" You think Biden calls people up and says, ""I'd like to see a plant?"" I don't think so. He wants to go to sleep, and she wants to do other things. We don't know what they are. We'll find out, unfortunately.
No, but I said, ""I want to see a plant."" He said, ""Well, I can't really take you to the US because we're not building the good ones, but the big ones are being built in Mexico."" I said, ""What do you mean, Mexico?"" They're being built by China, and they're the biggest in the world, actually. One plant will be doing more than all of Michigan. So I said, ""This is not good.""
And then they think they're going to take the cars, build them, and sell them over to the United States, or go around the little horn and sell them to the United States, and destroy our automobile—And it would. It would destroy. So I said, ""I've had it,"" and I started talking about tariffs. We're going to put massive tariffs on these companies that are coming in and destroying our jobs and our companies.
And so I went very public with it for the last four months about tariffs. I love tariffs. I love tariffs. What they can do for you, income and protection, and even third-party things you can do just by the threat of tariffs. Because we're the pot of gold. We won't be the pot of gold long if we don't do something. So I was making a speech the other day in Detroit at the Economic Club, which is a great place, beautiful. And talking about cars, and I saw the man that is the great car factory builder who I know, John, I won't give his full name, but John. And I saw him and I said, ""Could I see you after the speech?"" I made the speech. I went to see him. I said, ""How are those plants coming, the big ones in China?"" They said, ""Sir, they just canceled them because they think you're going to get elected, and they don't want to build them because they won't be able to pay tariffs."" [cheers and applause]
We just canceled them. I didn't even do anything, and I just saved Detroit. I just saved every car-making state. No, but think of it. And I thought to myself, ""Just the threat of tariffs, they canceled these multi-billion dollar auto factories,"" auto machines is what they really are. Now, will I get credit for that? I don't think so, but we know. But he just said, ""Because of you, they think you're going to get elected. They think you're going to charge tariffs that are so much that it won't be possible for them to survive."" And China just canceled those big, beautiful factories that would've destroyed our country in terms of auto making. And I think it's great. And now people are starting to see it. They're saying, ""That was a pretty good thing to do."" I didn't even do anything. Just a mere threat of that beautiful word kept what we have.
Don't forget, a lot of it's been taken over 50, 60 years. We were the greatest powerhouse. We will have that back soon. I think we can compete with it. We will have that back soon. We're going to have so many auto plants and so many steel plants built in this country now. So simple too. [cheers and applause] It's so simple. And I've been talking about this for the last couple of months, and people are starting to understand it. They're starting to understand it. And China does it. They've been doing it for a long time. They say, ""We don't want your cars. If you want to build a car, you build it in our country.""
They did it with Harley Davidson in India. They charge a 200% tariff on a motorcycle. They said, ""If you want to do this, you have to build it. We don't want your motorcycles. We're going to charge you 200. Harley Davidson said, ""We don't sell any in India. Tariff's too high."" I said, ""What are you going to do?"" They said, ""We've got to build a plant over there, sir."" We're the only one that doesn't do it because we're ruled by corrupt and stupid politicians. But we're doing it now.
As we build our economy, we'll also restore our borders. For four straight years, Kamala has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from prisons and jails. They come from insane asylums and mental institutions and all around the world. They come from Venezuela to the Congo. They come from the Congo now. A lot of them are coming out of the jails of the Congo, and she's resettled them into our communities, to prey upon our innocent American citizens.
No, we're not going to do that. When I win on November 5th, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins. We're not going to have it. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!
TRUMP: Thank you. And every day, Kamala is using migrant flights and her phone app. Do you believe they have a phone app for the criminal cartels to call up? ""Hello, this is Jose Rodriguez. I'd like to know where do I dispose of my illegal migrants?"" And they tell you where to drop them. Can you believe it? The only thing worse are the flights.
They have planes flying over our border, a big beautiful Boeing, 727, 737s, and just like that beautiful plane over there. Isn't it a pretty plane? [cheers and applause] 757, 767s, they have planes flying back and forth, loaded up with migrants only going one way, by the way, to flood Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin, that's what they're doing, and the entire Midwest with thousands and thousands of illegal migrants. And many of these are very dangerous people. They'll look at you, they'll cut you up, and they won't even think about it. As just one example, the 4,000 person town of Charleroi, Pennsylvania has seen, listen to this, a 2000% increase in the population of illegal migrants. Think of that, 2000% increase in the population of illegal migrants under Harris. She doesn't want to be called border czar, but you know what? I don't care. She was in charge of the border. This deficient, this mentally deficient president put her in charge of the border, and she never went there, not once. And she never—
When the border patrol last week endorsed me so strongly, I asked them, ""How often did you speak to her? You were dealing with her."" They said, ""Sir, we never spoke to her once."" I said, ""Who did she speak to?"" There were like 40 guys on the stage, all the leaders of the border patrol. She said, ""Not one of them did she speak to, not one."" Pennsylvania is not going to take it anymore. One of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gangs that Kamala has imported into our country is the savage Venezuelan Prison Gang Tren de Aragua. Has anyone heard of it? You've heard of MS-13 these are right in the same category. You don't get any meaner or tougher, but they're taking over apartment complexes—like I do. I'm in the real estate business also. Isn't it—They do it differently. They do it with guns. I do it with financing. And unleashing a violent terror spree all across America. This is happening all over. Let's watch.
[start of video]
NARRATOR: Open borders, deadly consequences.
NARRATOR: Border crisis. Record high crossings are putting a strain on cities across America.
NARRATOR: It is a full-blown invasion.
NARRATOR: Armed Venezuelan gang members storming an apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado.
NARRATOR: People talk about migrant crime. This is what they're talking about.

NARRATOR: More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder have been released into the United States.
MOTHER OF KAYLA HAMILTON: My 20-year-old daughter, Kayla Hamilton, was murdered in her own room. Kayla's murderer was apprehended by border patrol crossing illegally into the US.
NARRATOR: Kayla's murderer had been improperly released into the United States.
NARRATOR: Abolish ICE.
HARRIS: Yeah, we need to probably think about starting from scratch.
NARRATOR: An Afghan National was in custody today after being accused of plotting an election day terrorist attack. The suspect entered the US on a special immigrant visa.
NARRATOR: More than a dozen people suspected of being Tren de Aragua gang members right here in San Antonio.
NARRATOR: The gang members had been terrorizing the apartment complex.
NARRATOR: New details in the murder of Laken Riley. The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuelan national.

[end of video]
TRUMP: And it's that way all over America. And I say it's a much bigger—The polls are saying that the biggest problem is inflation and the economy. I say that's a bigger problem. I'd move inflation and the economy to number two. That is a bigger problem because that's destroying the fabric of our country. The United States is now an occupied country, but November 5th, 2024 will be liberation day in America. It's going to be liberation day. [cheers and applause] Under Kamala Harris, 13,099 illegal alien convicted murders are on the loose right now in the United States of America. Can you believe it? Just this week, two illegal alien members of the same savage Venezuelan gang were arrested in New York for robbing, shooting, and murdering a 59-year-old man in a Connecticut hotel. One of these illegal alien monsters was a got-away. Do you know what that is? These are the illegal got-aways. And the other was caught, but then released into our country by Kamala Harris and her horrible, horrible free open borders. Immediately upon taking the oath of office, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. [cheers and applause]
We have no choice. I don't want to do it. The record right now is Dwight Eisenhower, a moderate president that couldn't stand—He just couldn't stand what was happening with the border many years ago. Dwight Eisenhower, General Eisenhower, he was a good president, but he was a moderate person, but he has every record. He just couldn't stand watching the borders be crossed by people that weren't citizens of our country. I will rescue every town across America that has been invaded and conquered, and we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in a jail or kick them out of our country immediately. They will get sent back to where they came from. We have no choice. [cheers and applause]
And to expedite removals of Tren de Aragua and other savage gangs, I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Can you believe that? We couldn't have an act like that now because now everything's woke. You know, we have woke generals like Milley and Mattis. We have woke people. They don't do things like this, so we had to go back to 1798 when we had real people running our country. The Alien Enemies Act of 17 gives us tremendous power to the President to do what's right, to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil. And if they come back into our country, it's an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole. So when they come back, if they come back—When they hear that, they won't come back. And if that's not good enough, we'll make it 20. And I'm also calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer, right? [cheers and applause]
CROWD: TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!
TRUMP: Kamala's invasion is also bankrupting Medicare and Social Security. She wants to give millions of illegals the benefits you work for your entire lives. And by the way, by talking about education, social security, all of the different benefits. That's why people are pouring up into our country. If you say you're not going to get it, they won't come. They're coming because we say, ""Come on up"" like that idiot governor from California, Gavin Newscum [sic] [booing], Gavin Newscum [sic]. Did you see the other day he signed a bill that you are not even allowed to ask a person whether or not they have voter ID. If you ask them, it's a criminal penalty. If you say, ""Sir, I'd like to see your voter ID,"" they want to put you in jail for saying that. We are not going to stand—I'm going to get that thing overturned so fast. He just signed the bill. Because we want, ultimately, one-day voting, we want paper ballots, we want voter ID, and we want proof of citizenship, and we're finished. [cheers and applause]
And we'll have quick fair elections that will cost 8% of the cost of these very beautiful fancy machines that go up to Mars and around and down and all over the place. You ever see this, where they have machines? We spend all this money in machines, and then they announce we expect to have the results like seven days after the election. If you had paper ballots, you get them at 10 o'clock. France went to paper because what we did didn't work. The mail-in ballots didn't work. France had them. And you know what? Didn't work. There was a lot of theft, a lot of things going on. They went to paper ballots, same-day voting, 38 million votes. Everything was done by 10 o'clock in the evening. No people complaining, nothing. I will protect, for a fraction—By the way, for a fraction of the cost. I will protect our seniors and ensure that federal benefits are for Americans only. I just want them to be only for Americans. Kamala is telling you if you vote for her, it's four more years of the same. Take a look.

INTERVIEWER: Were you the last person in the room?
HARRIS [?]: Yes.
[end of video] [booing]
TRUMP: That's it, right? She'd do nothing different than the worst administration in the history of our country? The happiest person in life, he just turned over 100 years old now, he's over 100, he turned a few weeks ago, Jimmy Carter, he's the happiest man around. You know why? Because he looks brilliant compared to this Administration. The Carter administration is brilliant compared to these people. He didn't destroy our country at the border.
Pennsylvania, if you want to end this disaster, you must get out and vote. You have to go and vote. Get everybody you can. And ladies and gentlemen, we can start really well. There's a man. I'm going to call him up real quickly. His name is David McCormick. He's really—he is a great man, been successful at everything. He's smart, he's tough. Everything he did turned out to be great, and I think this is going to be just the start. Vote for him for the Senate.
Your particular Senator right now is a total stiff. Thank you. Who says he's my best friend. He just announced he's for me with tariffs. I don't know the gentleman. This is the guy that's going to do it, David McCormick. [cheers and applause]
DAVID MCCORMICK: Thank you, Mr. President. Well, Mr. President, it all comes down to Pennsylvania. It all comes down to the Keystone state. We've got to put you back in the White House so we can have strength and common-sense policies to fight back on this crazy liberal agenda, the weakness of Kamala Harris that has taken us over the cliff. So we're with you Mr. President, 100%. We're going to fight for you, but we also got to get a majority in the Senate so we can put those common-sense policies in place. And that's why we got to retire Bob Casey, 30-year career politician. He's weak, and he's voted 100% with the crazy liberal agenda of Biden-Harris. We got to send Bob Casey home. And Mr. President, first time today, I just heard this an hour or two ago, good news, first public poll that says McCormick's in the lead over Casey. [cheers and applause] We're going to win this, but we need to fight, fight, fight for the next 17 days. No sleep. Take our country back. Thank you, Mr. President.
CROWD: FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
TRUMP: Thank you very much, David. David's a good man. And he's going to really represent you, and he's going to work with us on getting your taxes down, et cetera. We're also joined by representatives, John Joyce, great guy. Where's John? Hello, John. Dan Meuser, who's fantastic, my friend, all my friends, and Byron Donalds of Florida. [cheers and applause] And also, I tell you if you're a football fan, these guys are good. I guess they're going to the game a little bit later or something. Are you going to the game? Are you going or you're going to watch it on television? Former NFL stars, Antonio Brown—Oh, he was a good player. [cheers and applause] He was a good player. And Le'Veon Bell, really good players. And Mike Wallace. Come on up, fellas. Come on up.
ANTONIO BROWN: Let's vote for Trump, baby. Make some noise for the president. [cheers and applause]
LE'VEON BELL: Let's go Trump. You already know. Vote Trump. Let's go.
BROWN: [leading chant with crowd] Here we go, Steelers.
CROWD: Here we go.
BROWN: Here we go Steelers.
CROWD: Here we go.
BELL: Thank so much. See you tomorrow at the game.
TRUMP: Have a good time. Thank you.
MIKE WALLACE: Appreciate you.
TRUMP: They look good. We're also deeply honored to be joined by gold star family members of the service members, several of them who gave their lives in Afghanistan. So, so horrible, so horrible that this had to happen. They're friends of mine. Many of the families are friends of mine. I've gotten to know him over this, and it's just horrible. Should have never happened, would've never happened. Corporal Hunter Lopez and his family is here. We're honoring these people. [applause] Corporal Humberto Sanchez, Staff Sergeant Taylor Hoover, Sergeant Nicole G., and Corporal Kareem Nikoui. Thank you very much. Great people. I got to know them very well. Should it never, ever happened. 13, 13 people and many, many so badly injured. We have to talk about them. I talk about them all the time with the legs and the arms and just obliteration. So I want to thank you all very much.
Thank you for being here. Thank you. I also want to thank Elon Musk, because when I called him on North Carolina and Georgia, as you know, they had almost no—Especially in North Carolina, they had no communication. The lines were all down a few weeks ago with Hurricane Helene. And I called Elon. They said, ""Do you know Elon Musk?"" I said, ""I happen to know him. What do you want?"" ""We need Starlink."" I said, ""What does Starlink? Tell me, please. Give me a lesson. Tell me."" And they told me, ""It's basically great communication, and up to a satellite and back."" And they said, ""We just have to have it. We can't get it because it's very hard to get."" And I called Elon and he had it there literally in moments. It was amazing how fast he got it there for them. So I want to thank Elon for doing that. That was great. [cheers and applause] People of North Carolina. So we're working very hard for Pennsylvania. But in breaking news, it was just announced that the highly respected Florida judge who is overseeing our case against the Pulitzer Prize Board for awarding their once highly respected prizes to the failing New York Times and the Washington Post. These are really fake news papers. Call them fake news papers, but they're fake news, Russia, Russia, Russia stories. They got the Pulitzer Prize for Russia, Russia, Russia. Turned out to be a fake story. So I figured, what the hell, on your behalf, I'd sue their off. [cheers and applause] And he's ordered discovery to move full speed ahead. He wants it to go. That means that we will be able to learn the full scale of their lies, deceit, and wrongdoing, and we'll hold these radical lunatics accountable for the lying that they've done to the American people. What they've done is incredible.
Think of it. They got the Pulitzer Prize for their great reporting on Russia, Russia, Russia, and then it turned out to be a hoax, and now everybody knows it. So I want them to return those Pulitzer Prizes, and I think lots of damages should be awarded to a lot of different people. [cheers and applause] So here are the facts. Kamala Harris is a radical left Marxist rated even worse than Bernie. She destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of Defund the Police, and anybody who wants to defund it could not be president of the United States. We cherish our police, and we're going to give them back their respect and their dignity and let them do the job, and crime will fall. Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE. These are tough people. I know a lot of tough people right in this first few rows. They're not tough like these guys.
As California Attorney General, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon, and rape of an unconscious person as totally nonviolent crimes. She pledged to confiscate your guns and endorsed a total ban on handgun ownership. She even called for free sex changes for illegal aliens and detention at taxpayers expense. She lied about working at McDonald's, a simple thing. I think very soon, maybe tomorrow or something, I'm going to work the French fry. [cheers and applause] I think so.
I think I'm doing it tomorrow, and I think it's in a place in Pennsylvania. And I'm going to stand over that French fry. She lied about her—It's a very basic thing to say. They'll say—Oh, look at all that press. That's lot of press. But they're going to say, ""Oh, it's so basic."" It is basic, but the basic is easier to understand. She said, as part of a resume, for years, I worked at McDonald's. It's probably tough, but she never worked there. It turned out to be a hoax. So on top of all of this, Kamala turned on our military and wants to make them woke. Take a look at our real military. Just take a look at it.

[end of video] [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: That wasn't exactly woke. So in conclusion—And thank you for being here, everybody. This is beautiful. [cheers and applause] We'll get you out real fast. We are you going to get you to go watch that game tonight, right? We really do appreciate this kind of crowd, and the love that we've had is incredible. But with your vote this November, we are going to fire Kamala Harris. We are going to save America. We're going to rebuild our nation for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. With your support, we will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We'll cut your taxes, demolish inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages, and turn the United States into the manufacturing superpower of the world. We will hire American, buy American, build American, and show the whole world that the American dream is back, bigger, better and stronger than ever before. I will end the war in Ukraine, stop the chaos in the Middle East, and prevent World War III. And I'm the one that can do it. I'm the only one that's going to do it. [cheers and applause]
I will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, and resources. And we have to give them respect again. We're going to give them respect like they've never had. And they're going to get rid of crime, and they'll get rid of it quickly and efficiently. We cannot live with the kind of crime that we're living with in our country today. We will strengthen and modernize our military. I rebuilt our military, and now we're going to modernize it still further. We will build a missile defense shield all made in the USA, including the Commonwealth is going to build a lot of it. We're entitled to it. We're entitled to it. Others have it. We want it too. And we will land an American astronaut on Mars. Get ready, Elon. Get ready. We got to land, and we got to do it quickly. But a lot of that has to do with military, the space.
I created Space Force, and it's going to go down. In my opinion, it's just about the most important with time of the forces. We were way behind Russia and China, and now we're leading them by a lot. It's a great thing, Space Force. First time in 82 years since Air Force that this happened. We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington D.C., making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. We will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools, and we will immediately keep men out of women's sports. [cheers and applause]
I will defend religious liberty, I will restore free speech, and I will defend the right to keep and bear arms, our second amendment. And we'll end sanctuary cities and stop illegal immigration once and for all. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. After years of building up foreign countries, defending foreign borders, and protecting foreign lands, we will finally be going to build our country, defend our borders, and protect our American cities, suburbs, and towns. We will protect them like they have never been protected before. We will not be invaded. We will not be occupied. We will not be conquered. They're doing. This is an invasion into our country of a foreign military. We will be free and proud as a nation again. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive, and every day we'll be filled with opportunity and hope.
But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda once and for all. It will happen, will happen. We want a landslide that's too big to rig. So early voting is underway. Get everyone and vote. After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of our country. These will be four of the greatest years in the history of our country, and it's going to happen quickly. With your help, from now until election day, we will redeem America's promise, and we will take back the nation that we love. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. We will never give in. We will never back down, ever, ever, ever, and we will never, ever surrender. Together, we will fight, fight, fight. We will vote, vote, vote, and we will win, win, win like we have never won before. [cheers and applause]
November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country. And together, we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Thank you. God bless you all. God bless you. [cheers and applause]

TRUMP: Thank you very much. You know, over the years I've had and heard that song sung by others, and you know, honestly, it's not the same. This man just sings it in a way that nobody else can sing that particular song, and it's become so popular, like in some circles, the most popular song of its kind. I just want to thank Lee. He's been with us from the beginning. Really a talented, unique guy, and a good person with a great family. So thank you very much, Lee. We appreciate it very much. [cheers and applause]
And a very special hello to North Carolina. [cheers and applause] I don't know if my boy told you, but Laura and Eric have two beautiful children. One of them happens to be named Carolina, so that's pretty good. That means you like the place pretty much, huh? So it's great, but it's also great to be back in this incredible state with so many proud American patriots who believe in faith and family, God, and country. Thank you very much. [cheers and applause]
We need more of that in this nation, don't we? We need more of that. We'd be a much different place right now, because right now it's not doing well. Right now, we're a failing nation, but we will soon be a great nation again.
Earlier today, I visited Western North Carolina and witnessed the terrible devastation from Hurricane Helene. I was actually here about a week and a half ago right after, but I didn't want to come into certain sections, because I wanted to let them do their job. Our federal government, as you know, and FEMA has really let them down, especially in North Carolina. It's a shame. They spent a lot of money on having illegal people come into our country, migrants. You've heard about it. There wasn't a lot of money for the people of North Carolina or a lot of the people from a lot of other states that were also devastated by that monster. That was a monster storm.
But so many people have come together and done an incredible job, including Franklin Graham, who's been amazing. [cheers and applause] To every family who has lost a loved one, a home, our hearts are with you, and we're praying for you. The homes are bad, but family members are really bad. That's a tough one. It's something you can never shake that, but all I can do is say, we love you and we're with you 100 percent. And on January 20th, if we win this election, I always like to say ""if,"" and people say, ""Oh, please say when,"" but you know, we have to understand that bad things can happen, but we're not going to let it happen. We're never going to let it happen again. We're doing really well. We're leading. I know nobody in this room gambles, but some of the gambling polls are really in there, like 65 to 35 or something like that, I saw one. But nobody here gambles.
Does anybody in this room? No, no, no, no, no. Great Christians don't gamble, do they? Oh, no. So we're doing really well, I would say beyond our wildest expectations, and that's not only in polls. More particularly, it's in the votes that are being cast. They're coming in at levels that we've never seen. One of the things that's amazing is North Carolina, so it was devastated, devastated, and yet areas that were the worst, the worst areas, we just left one, as you know, and I met some of the greatest people, but they just set a record for votes cast thus far, and their homes are gone. [cheers and applause] I mean, it's an amazing, amazing thing. I figured maybe you'd get 50%, and these are, they call it Trump country, and I'm very honored by that. But these are Trump people, and just think of that; their homes have gone, they've gone through such hell, and it's as big a water storm, they say, as we've ever seen in this country.
And they just set a record. They compared it to the two elections previous, and we have a substantial number more. Can you imagine that? I mean, those are great, great people. Thank you very much. [cheers and applause] I want to thank a very special man, Ben Carson, Dr. Ben Carson, for organizing this, and of course Candy [Carson], because without Candy, I don't know if Ben would be the same. I don't think so, actually. That's a special couple, but can I tell him the one quick little story where you told me a couple of times? But Ben was very tough to beat, actually. He was getting up, up, up, and other people were falling in the wrong direction, because he was in a primary with me, the original primary. And one day in a church, it was a Sunday morning and he was doing well, really well, and in a church, he came over to him and he said, ""You know you're going to win, don't you?""
I said, ""What's this all about?"" Because he's a tough competitor. I said, ""What is this all about?"" He said, ""God has picked you to win."" [cheers and applause] Can you believe that? Right? And you have no idea. It was so tough for him to say that.
I said, ""This is really something,"" and he really was. He is something. People love him, and they loved him then, and they even love him more now. He went to HUD, which is a, I must say, it's always mired in scandal. People, you're giving out a lot of money and there's a lot of bad things happen when you're giving out all that money, and Ben went four years. Perfection. I don't know. [applause] Has it ever happened before? Has it ever happened before? I wasn't surprised, but a lot of people were surprised. Anytime you get through that one for four years, you have to be one honest gentleman. But he ran it really great, and he's a special man and he's done a special job today, and it's my honor to be here. Thank you very much, and thank you, Ben and Candy, very much. Appreciate it. That's some story though, isn't it Ben, huh? Candy? I love that story.
I'd also like to thank somebody that's done unbelievable things, and especially in very hard times. I've seem to—When I was president and I would go to a lot of the sites, the tornadoes, the tornadoes of vicious, they ask, ""Which are the worst, the tornadoes, the hurricanes, the tsunamis?"" And I have a friend, that's what he does. He studies this. I said, ""So what's the worst?"" He actually said, ""Tsunami. The ocean just lifts up, and a lot of bad things happen, in terms of the level,"" but they're all bad in their own way, but I've been with Franklin Graham through a lot of them, and we're very happy to have helped them out during the course of most of them, and maybe in particular, this one. This was so sad to see such a great part of our country and so devastating. When you looked at the size of that storm, that hurricane, it covered the whole state of Florida, practically. Normally, you see a little trough through it or hitting one area, but you'd look at the map, and you look at the whole state of Florida was covered in one form or another. Franklin Graham just is a special, special person with a great family.
And his father wasn't too bad either, right? [cheers and applause] You know, my father used to take me to Yankee Stadium. He loved Billy Graham, and he would take me as a young guy. He would take me to Yankee Stadium. He thought Billy Graham was great, and I'll tell you what. Billy Graham is looking down, and he's very proud of his son and his family. I can tell you that, without question. [cheers and applause]
Pastor Paula White, I've known for a long time. She is so unbelievable, what she's done for the campaign. She's just organized everything. Everybody respects her. She'll call meetings, and everybody shows up. Even if it's two hours later, they'll get here. She's just a very incredible woman. What she's done with evangelicals, what she's done with, actually, people of all faiths, it's, what she's done really has made a big difference. We get 88% of the vote.
People would say, ""Wow, that's not bad. 88%,"" and they said, ""How did you do that?"" I said, ""Would you please speak to Paula White?"" Because she knew what she was doing, and we have a team of pastors, ministers, and even rabbis, where they like what I've done for Israel. I can tell you that. We have a lot of rabbis. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Where is Paula? Where is Paula? She was right behind me before. She's probably working. That's what she does, but Paula, she's here someplace. She's right back there. She's making phone calls, getting more people lined up for the vote. I'd rather have her do that than be here. But that's the kind of person she is. She's fantastic, and Scott Turner, who was in the administration. Scott, where's Scott? Come on, Scott. This guy, a great person, a great everything, great athlete, and a very fine man, and you really did something very special for the administration. We really appreciate it, and get ready, get ready. Just keep yourself in good shape. We don't have to worry about his shape, I can tell you that, but we appreciate it, Scott.
Thank you very much. And a beautiful speaker, boy. He got up, and he would talk to groups of people and they were so jazzed up. They could do anything. He was very special, and a person, I have to say, the most special. We have to say has been the most special of them all because he's my son. You know? [cheers and applause] I mean—I'm saying how can he be more special than Ben Carson? But Ben, do you mind if I say, he's my son? Am I allowed to say just slightly more special? Oh, you're tied. Let's call it a tie, okay? But Eric has been amazing in business, and everything he has done has been so incredible. He has become a legend in the legal profession because he's the most subpoenaed human being in history. [laughing] He's gotten more subpoenas than any human being in history. Every day, Congress, ""This one and that one, deranged Jack Smith."" We had people, the likes of which nobody, you talk about weaponization of government, what they've done is incredible.
And he's cool as a cucumber. ""Yeah, dad. We got another couple of subpoenas today."" ""Where'd they come from?"" ""Congress. This one, that one."" And crazy Nancy Pelosi would send them like it's cookies. [laughing] She had subpoenas on the corner of her desk, and congressmen would just walk in and grab a subpoena, write it, and send it. I'd say, ""Yeah, Eric. Handle it."" He became very proficient. He's a great, young man and he really is very excited about today. Did he do a good job when he spoke? [cheers and applause] No, he's great. He's great. He's got a lot of talent, a lot of talent. And also here is my daughter, Tiffany, and her husband, Michael. And Tiffany is pregnant, going to have a baby. [cheers and applause] She's going to have a baby, and is going to be a, I am not allowed to say what the baby is going to be, am I? I don't know. I'm not going to put her on the spot. I'm not going to say it. I'm not taking a chance. I don't want to see her have a long face, ""Dad, you shouldn't have said that, dad.""
But she's been, from day one, she was a great student, and she went to a fantastic law school, graduated number one in her class, [cheers and applause] and we couldn't be happier. I mean, I've just never had a problem with her. I shouldn't say. We better knock on wood. Where's some wood around here? That's one piece of wood. Most of it is plastic. But she has been, she's been an amazing person, and her husband's doing a great job. And thank you, Michael, for the job you're doing. Appreciate it. Congratulations though.
And Linda McMahon, who most of you know, she headed up small business for the government. Now, small business is giant business. When you add it all up, it's about as big—I think it's probably bigger than any bank in the world, and she was one of our great people in the administration and a very, very successful woman. She was very generous, I know, with Franklin and with the work done here, she was really very generous and she's always generous. She's been generous to the campaign but we're very proud of her. Linda, wherever you may be? Where are you, Linda? Linda? Linda? [cheers and applause] Thank you, Linda. Thank you, thank you. An incredible woman.
And a friend of mine also, Steve Witkoff, who's a very successful man and he is—Where is Witkoff? He is somebody that's been also very—He wrote a big check for Franklin to take care of a place called North Carolina and so we like him. Even if we didn't like him, we like him, right? Steve Witkoff. Thank you, Steve, very much.
And Peter Navarro, I heard he gave a great speech and Peter is—Peter took a lot of abuse, talk about weaponization. And do I see my favorite person here? Will you please stand up? What's this all about? Stand up. Wow. Thank you, darling. Right from the beginning, right? Right from the beginning, from day one, thank you very much. Thank you very much, [inaudible], appreciate it. And thank you to every pastor, patriot, and faith leader here today, we have so many. We have so many people, I'm—This is the worst is, when you introduce some, you're in trouble. Because I'm seeing six, seven people, I get a lot of people that—I see a group of two over there, I'm in trouble but let's get on with it. Do you mind? Let's get on because, with your help, we're going to make America great again. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Michael. Thank you very much.
So, I was introduced to church at a very early age and I had a wonderful church, actually, in Jamaica, Queens, First Presbyterian Church. I don't know if you know it, it was built a long time ago and it was great. But very early and then, ultimately, on Sundays, my parents Fred and Mary would drive me into Manhattan to worship at Marble Collegiate Church where Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, the author of one of the really big bestsellers, ""The Power of Positive Thinking,"" he was the head pastor, great book. It was a great book then and a great book now. Power of Positive Thinking, a lot of people could use a little positive thinking, right? And he was an incredible speaker. My sister and I were both married there and the funeral services for both of my parents, I mean, my mom and dad were—They took place in the main sanctuary of Marble Collegiate Church and it was just always very special.
I still remember the great sermons of Norman Vincent Peale and he truly was one of the greatest speakers I've ever—First, he was a believer but he was also a great speaker, unbelievable man. I actually saw his last sermon but, when you left church, you were really disappointed that it was over. I can't—I have to say, I know we have a lot of pastors and ministers but sometimes it's like—Am I allowed to say that? It's like a Biden, you know? [cheers and applause] Sometimes, not often, of course. But this man—And he always preached in sort of modern times, a little bit in modern times, he'd bring it up, I remember. I remember so many of his sermons but he talked about Alfred Sloan who was the founder of General Motors and how he grew up and how he had tremendous problems with alcohol and he became a major alcoholic. And then you know, Norman Vincent Peale would just say, ""And then one day he met God,"" and he would just—The expression of this man. He used to stand at a podium and he'd always be like this [steps away from podium], just like that and he'd preach and you really were, you were disappointed when it was over.
He'd tell you stories about God, about many things, about life. It was really stories about life and how it pertained to religion and it was really amazing. And he was amazing and a brilliant—Just the enthusiasm he had. And I listened to him for, I would say, 20 years and then, one day, I went to church, Marble Collegiate, and he was now, I guess, in his 90s and he was preaching and you could see he was getting a little bit tired and he stood just like I said, right over here to the left of the podium and he said, ""I can't do this anymore."" That was it and he just sat down, we all understood. He was just—He was really—No, he was really—It was his last time at the podium and the last time he preached and it was an amazing moment and everybody just stood up and applauded, it was sort of a beautiful thing to watch actually. But to see him, because he was truly a very big name at the time and very respected and the fact that he wrote this book that was such a big bestseller, it was a massive bestseller. Still is, I think. But as I look back at my life's journey and events, I now recognize that it's been the hand of God leading me to where I am today. [cheers and applause] Thank you.
CROWD MEMBER: Amen.
TRUMP: And my faith took on new meaning on July 13th in Butler, Pennsylvania where I was knocked to the ground essentially by what seemed like a supernatural hand and I would like to think that God saved me for a purpose and that's to make our country greater than ever before. [cheers and applause]
Thank you. Thank you very much. And that is something. Eric is a great shooter, great. If he were a golfer, he'd be a plus four. He's a great shooter and so is Don, they're both great shooters, they know a lot about guns. In fact, I think I got the blessing of the NRA because of my sons. Early on, I remember I was running against a lot of people that had good gun credentials, and 2016, and the NRA, which was in its full bloom actually, they even spent $35 million on the campaign but I think they did it because of my sons because they beat out a lot of very good people that believed in that whole world, little different world but that whole world because of Don and Eric. But when they both heard what had happened that day at Butler, they said, ""How far was it?"" and I said it was 130 yards and they knew the weapon and they said, ""I can't believe it,"" because—Eric actually said a bad shooter would hit you every single time and I didn't realize it to that extent.
I made that right-hand turn and I made it a little quickly and that got me in a position where it just psshh [sic]. Not a good feeling but much better than the alternative. [laughing] It wasn't the best feeling. And it was a bloody sucker, I will tell you that. I didn't realize but the doctor told me, he told me a couple of things, he said, ""You're the luckiest man I've ever seen."" He said, ""I've been doing this for 25 years,"" and he said, ""Sir, I'd like to suggest that you go out right now and buy a lottery ticket because this is a good day."" [laughing] But Eric told me and Don told me that—I think they became more religious that day because they said that was amazing that we could have survived something like that. An eighth of an inch to a quarter of an inch away so it's pretty amazing.
CROWD MEMBER: Praise God.
TRUMP: And if we didn't make—Thank you. And if we didn't make—Thank you very much. If we didn't make the turn, that wouldn't have happened. And I made the turn to show a chart which became my all-time favorite chart in the history of the world. [cheers and applause] My all-time favorite, I sleep with that chart, I kiss that chart. [laughing] But we're 15 days away from the most important election in the history of our country and, if you want to know what is at stake for Christians in this race, just listen to what Kamala Harris had to say last week. Because when two college students, religious college students and very good people, everybody said what wonderful young men they were and are, at a campaign stop, she heard shouting from the background Jesus is Lord-
CROWD MEMBER: Jesus is Lord.
TRUMP: Jesus is Lord. And Kamala Harris ridiculed them, mocked them, and told them they were, quote, ""You're at the wrong rally. Get the""—She basically said get out but I won't say that because people didn't hear that so much but then she said you're at the wrong rally. And that's really what she meant, that's really what she meant. She's very destructive to religion, she's very destructive to Christianity and very destructive to evangelicals and to the Catholic Church. And she's, let me put it this way, Ben, she is your worst nightmare, much worse than Biden and he wasn't so hot. [laughing] But while Kamala says that people who believe in Jesus don't belong to her rallies, you have to remember that that's as loud as it can be. In fact, a lot of people said that would be disqualifying for her, that would be a disqualification. In our movement, we love Christians, we welcome believers and we embrace followers of Jesus. [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Thank you.
CROWD: JESUS! JESUS! JESUS!
TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Boy, this is a lively group, Ben. This is a very lively group you've assembled. What's going on with Ben? This is something, Ben. But at Trump rallies, we don't tell Christians to get lost, we tell Christians to get out and vote. [cheers and applause]
You don't have the choice of sitting out this election because, if Kamala Harris gets four more years, the radical left is not going to leave Christians alone, it's going to get worse and worse and you're going to suffer greatly. They will come after Christians all over the country, Kamala Harris has vowed to abolish the filibuster, letting her pack the Supreme Court and I even heard as many as 25 justices. The Supreme Court with Marxist radicals, with people that we don't want on the Supreme Court to rewrite the Constitution and to overrule your values. I think one of the greatest things I've done is the Supreme Court and also getting over 300 judges appointed throughout our land that have made a tremendous difference. [applause] Those 300 judges have made a tremendous difference. She'll flood our country with tens of millions more illegal aliens and make them all citizens cancelling out your voting power forever. Kamala will mandate that every public school in America must promote the idea that children can change their genders [booing], allow men into girls' locker room, and also allow men to play in women's sports. [booing] Can you imagine that, men in women's sports?
And it's such a strong movement by, I believe, really, a very, very small group of people. Because you know, it's interesting, I haven't met one person that thinks that's a good idea and yet it's a movement, but I've never met anybody. Now, I don't know everybody but I haven't met anybody that wants it. And even the young ladies that are afraid of what's happening, you saw the other day the volleyball player who was hit very hard on the head by a ball, a smash that—In fact, I saw this person, a person who transitioned hit the ball. I mean, that ball was moving as fast as the ball can move and she said I've never seen anything like it, really whacked her. But some people were put out of commission just in volleyball, let alone other sports. But when you look at weightlifting, how about that one? Or you look at swimming records, track records, it's so demeaning to women, it's so ridiculous, it's so demeaning. [cheers and applause]
But Kamala will force doctors and parents to allow sex changes and genital-mutilation of minor children, that's what they do. She has it literally where sex change operations for people in detention, when they were being held in detention, if they wanted a sex change operation, she said, ""Yes, I approve it."" Who would do this? Who would do this?
And you know, I'm talking about everything else but I'm also talking it's an extremely difficult operation and a very expensive operation but who would do this and who would want this? And between that, she was the head of the movement defund the police. You have to understand, she's a radical left Marxist and a lot of people want to know what does that mean? She's a person so far left like nobody's seen in the Senate in many, many years. But the main thing is she's not a very bright person either, that's a dangerous—That's a really dangerous combination. Your religious liberty will be gone, your free speech will be gone, your Second Amendment will be gone and parental rights will be gone forever. So, I'm here tonight to deliver a simple message to Christians across America, it's time to stand up and save your country. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Thank you very much, thank you very much.
CROWD MEMBER: Vote Trump!
TRUMP: On November 5th, Christian voters need to turn out in the largest numbers ever. Do you know that, if you did that—Because you have a reputation of not voting proportionately like you should, you do know that. I think that maybe it's a form of rebellion, could that be possible? The two groups, not to equate them, but they are probably associated in some form but Christians, Evangelicals but Christians and gun owners, gun owners don't vote. They vote but very small proportions. If they did or if Christians did, nobody could ever beat us, nobody. So, I hope that we're going to get numbers like we haven't seen you. Remember, this is your last day, today is your last day of registration, you have to remember that. And so, if you want to leave right now, go, I won't be insulted. Leave right now and go and register but this is your last day.
So, we need to tell Kamala Harris that we've had enough. Kamala, you've been the worst vice president, you're a member of the worst administration in the history of our country. The happiest person around is Jimmy Carter [laughing] because Jimmy Carter is considered a brilliant president by comparison to crooked Joe Biden. Jimmy Carter is brilliant, his administration will go down as a brilliant administration compared to Crooked Joe. But we're going to say, Kamala, you've done a horrible job, you're a horrible vice president, there's no way you're going to be our president. Kamala, you are fired. Get out. Out, out, out. [cheers and applause] Right?
For four straight years, I fought for Christians like no president has ever fought before, you know that. I protected the religious freedom of doctors, nurses, teachers, and faith groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor, oh, I fought for them. I blocked the IRS, they were coming after everybody. They still are, I guess, to an extent but now they are because of this administration. But I blocked the IRS from using the Johnson Amendment to interfere with pastors' freedom of speech. We want to hear from our pastors, we don't want them to be shy. Where they take away your tax-exempt status because a pastor mentioned something that's slightly political and I ended it, Kamala Harris has taken it away and we're not—I'll tell you what, if she has taken your right away, I gave that to you and they took it back but we're going to give it back to you within the first week. [cheers and applause] I'd like to make it the first day but it'll take me a little while. So, we're going to give it back to you, within the first week, you're going to have that right because we want to hear from these people. There aren't too many people I want to hear from but you I do want to hear from.
So, we're going to give you back within the first week and Paula will make sure that that takes place, I will not disappoint you. I appointed 300 judges to interpret the law and the Constitution as written [applause] and withstood the vicious attacks to confirm three great Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.[cheers and applause] And they're great and they're courageous. They're courageous and they're brilliant but they are courageous. What they have to endure with the radical left and all of the things that they have to listen to, I actually think it's illegal what people do. They call it playing the ref. You know playing the ref? They'll say horrible things hoping that the three but also judges, they play the ref with judges, the great Bobby Knight basketball. He used to scream at the referee, he would scream like nobody ever screamed before. Indiana, he was a great guy, he backed me early on. He said, ""You're going to win."" I said, ""Well, I don't know, Bobby."" He said, ""Yeah, you're going to win, I have no doubt."" He said, ""I want this guy named Trump to run for president.""
I didn't know him. I called him up to thank him, he said, ""You're going to win. All you have to do is say it, you got to run."" And he was a tough cookie. Just died recently but he had the last undefeated team in college basketball. He won two or three national championships, he was a great coach and he never had the great—He had a couple, I guess, great players but he never had that real player that some teams have, he just did it with team. But he would scream at the referees, they called it playing the ref and they'd say, ""Bobby, Bobby, you got to stop. Bobby, don't do it, you're not going to win this call. You're not going to win it, it's over."" He said, ""No, but I'm going to win the next call,"" and it's true. They'd knock the hell out of somebody and the referee was afraid to call it, it's true. He was a master.
But they do that, they play the ref. They start screaming about the judge is no good and this one's no good and they're slow and they're lousy judges and the judge should be impeached and all of this crap when you have a brilliant judge that's doing the right thing and they get—And some people will fold a little bit, they'll say, ""Hey, I'll get them off my back, let me just give a bad ruling here or there,"" and some will do that actually. But fortunately, most have courage and they understand. I really believe it's illegal what they do and I know there's some great lawyers in there and we're going to look at it because what they do is so obvious, what they've done to the Supreme Court, even with the protection of their houses—You're not supposed to be allowed to march in front. They didn't stop it. You're not allowed to do any of these things that are happening. But they're playing the ref and they're playing it with judges and justices and they shouldn't be allowed to do it. And I believe it's illegal. I issued guidance making clear that the right to freedom of worship does not end at the door to a public school. [cheers and applause] We took care of it. Thank you. Thank you very much.
And I stood proudly with our friend and ally, the state of Israel. I kept my promise, recognized Israel's eternal capital, and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem and I actually got it built. I actually got it built. But many presidents—many, many presidents before me said—They campaigned on doing that and then they didn't do it. And I understand why, because when I got into office, I was called by people, heads of state, highest level. I was called by kings and prime ministers. I was called by everybody, ""Don't do it. Don't do it."" And then they heard I was going to do it, and they all called me and I said, ""Just do me a favor."" I shouldn't say this because little white—What do you call it? Yeah, I wasn't available.
I said, ""Just tell 'em I won't be available but I'll call—"" This I think was a Thursday. I said, ""I'll call you back on Monday,"" to kings, to the biggest people from the biggest countries, most powerful countries. And I said, ""I'll call you back."" And then on Thursday I announced it. I said, ""We are going to do exactly what a lot of people didn't want me to do."" They said there'd be bloodshed and everything else all over. There was none. And I did something that no other president had the courage to do. And then on Monday I called them back, ""Hi, how have you been?"" [laughing] ""I tried getting you. I wasn't able to, but you've already done it."" So we made Jerusalem the capital. [cheers and applause] And that brought a lot of—Did you know that?
That was something I didn't know, but I understood why other presidents were—I mean, every single person that campaigned for decades and decades, every president said they were going to do it, none of them did it. I did it. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. The Golan Heights was a big deal. [cheers and applause] The Golan Heights, that's another thing. 72 years, people would come in and leave, come in and leave. They'd meet every year, every two years about the Golan Heights. And I spoke with David Friedman. I said, ""Give me a lesson in five minutes or less on the Golan Heights,"" and he did. Talked about how important it was strategically, before all of the modern equipment and radar and all of that that we have now. But it was unbelievably important from a military—Because it was the highest point in the Middle East. And I did that.
And nobody even asked for that because they thought that would be a bridge too far. But I did that for Israel, and I was the first and only president to convene a meeting at the United Nations to end religious persecution worldwide. [cheers and applause] Nobody's done what I've done in terms of religion, in terms of Christianity, but in terms of religion, nobody's done what I did. And we did all of this and much more in four short years. And I will keep on fighting for our cherished American values when we become the 47th President of the United States. [cheers and applause] Thank you.
Under Kamala Harris, you've seen the Department of Justice target parents at school board meetings. Have you ever seen anything like it? They're like the enemy. It's the craziest thing I've ever seen. These great people, they just want their children to be treated reasonably well. And the FBI would send spies into Catholic churches. If—I don't know how many Catholics are here, but if you're Catholic, there is no way you can be voting for these people. These people are a nightmare. I don't know what they have against Catholics, but Catholics are treated worse than anybody. So, and by the way, evangelicals are next. You can bet on it. Evangelicals are next. But they label Catholics as potential domestic terrorists. And the fact is that they'll be coming after you soon. These people are sick. These people are very sick people. Christians will not be safe with Kamala Harris as President of the United States.
It's not even thinkable. She's going to deal with President Xi of China. I don't think so. I know him very well. He's a very fierce man. Putin, all of these people, I know him all very well and we'll end up in Third World War because they have no idea. They have no idea. We're not going to have a Third World War. But if they get in, I think that we will have a Third World War out of stupidity, out of absolute stupidity. Think of it. Putin would've never, ever attacked Ukraine if I were president. All of those people that are now dead would not be dead. [applause] All of those cities that are knocked to the ground with those magnificent domed towers that are laying on the side, shattered into a million pieces, all of that would be up right now. You take a look at those cities, they've been bombed, they've been—There's nothing standing. There's literally not a building standing in many of them.
As soon as I take the oath of office, I will stop Kamala Harris weaponization of law enforcement against Americans of faith. We're going to do it. We're going to do it. [cheers and applause] Did you ever notice—So it's Kamala Harris. Nobody knows who the hell Harris is, right? Do you ever say, ""And we're going to stop Harris,"" they all go, ""Who's Harris?"" It's a weird thing. You think your name would be—But isn't it true nobody knows who Harris is, so we'll call her Kamala. It's a weird thing. Lots of strange things take place in politics, don't they? But I will create a new federal task force on fighting anti-Christian bias. That'll be done immediately. [cheers and applause] And I think it's very important for the people in this room to know, like Dr. Ben Carson knows, Americans of faith are not a threat to our country. Americans of faith are the soul of our country, right? [cheers and applause]
I will once again appoint rock-solid pro-constitutional judges to faithfully interpret the law and the constitution. The 300 judges that we appointed changed the whole—I mean, it was so bad. It was so bad what was happening out there. And these are great people, and they're fair people, and they do the right thing. We believe in the First Amendment rights of freedom of worship and freedom of speech. [applause] And I will deliver universal school choice, empowering every parent to send their child to the public, private, charter, or religious school that is right for them. [cheers and applause] And I will allow homeschool parents to spend ten thousand dollars a year tax-free on costs associated with their children's education. [cheers and applause]
Under the Trump administration, we will return patriotic education to our schools. That's okay. That's a good thing. [cheers and applause] Kamala Harris supports the 1619 Project. [booing] Think of that. She supports it strongly. That teaches children to hate their country, that's what it does. The 1619 Project was condemned by every historian, and yet, Kamala, Harris's administration tried to push it into schools all across America. She fought very hard for that. She also fought very hard for the people that burned down Minneapolis, that were literally at war in Minnesota with one of the worst governors. I cannot believe this guy's a governor. Can you imagine him as a president? He's a wackadoo. [laughing]And by the way, how good did JD Vance do in exposing him? [cheers and applause]
They lie about everything. You know, they were going today—Every single thing they say, it's the opposite. Project 2025, Trump loves it. He loves it. He loves—They just say it. I've totally disavowed. A group of people went and I don't know what they did. I said specifically—I refused to read it. But every time they get up, they say everything that I've disavowed, they go on again and again and again. And the radical left people that are listening to them just let them talk. And they know it's all a big lie, but they just lie. I've never seen anything like it. I've had some political opponents before. Even crooked Hillary didn't lie like these people. And she lied a lot. But these people are going—I actually think they're choking because I watched today every single thing that I've said, ""No, no, no,"" they say, ""he said yes, yes, yes,"" like point after point. And no, there's something going on in their heads. Perhaps it's Trump derangement syndrome. [cheers and applause]
It's horrible. Or perhaps they know they're losing because we're doing very well. They know how well we're doing even the fake news. And that's a lot of fake news back there, Ben. [booing] The fake news knows—The fake news knows how well we're doing. Isn't it sad that we have to rely on the gambling—? The gamblers are the ones that are the only ones that want to say it. They're the ones—65%. No, no, they know. But we're going to just let it wait. And I really think we're going to have maybe one of the greatest victories in the history of our country. [cheers and applause] History of our country.
On day one, I will sign an executive order banning schools from promoting critical race theory or transgender insanity. [cheers and applause] I will take historic action to defeat the toxic poison of gender ideology and reaffirm that God created two genders, male and female. [cheers and applause] I will keep men out of women's sports. [cheers and applause] I will sign a law banning child sexual mutilation in all 50 states, won't happen anymore. [cheers and applause] And we will proudly say Merry Christmas again. On day one, I will stop the migrant invasion. We will be begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country. [cheers and applause] I will end inflation and we will make America affordable again.
We will quickly become energy independent again. You know we were energy independent just four years ago. And we will frack, frack, frack, and drill, baby, drill. [cheers and applause] And I will cut energy prices in half within 12 months from January 20th, the day you assume the office of president because we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country, including Russia and including Saudi Arabia. We were third and maybe even fourth when I got in there. When I left, we were number one in energy production. And we did things that were amazing. We would've right now been four times higher than we were. We would've been making money, paying down debt. We would've been in a position that you wouldn't believe. But they decided to do it a different way. It's terrible. Wind. They put wind all over the place. Wind kills you birds. And if you want to watch television and the wind isn't blowing, you can forget it. [laughing]
"" Darling, let's watch the President tonight."" ""I'm sorry, Esther. But the wind isn't blowing. We won't be able to watch."" It's not exactly the most reliable source, but it is something. It's the most expensive source by far. I will end the war in Ukraine, stop the chaos in the Middle East, and prevent World War III. [cheers and applause] I will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources, and respect they so dearly deserve. We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington DC, making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. And we will secure our elections. Everyone will prosper. Every family will thrive. And every day we will be filled with opportunity and hope. We will again have the American dream for our children.
But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda. We have to stop it once and for all. We want a landslide that is too big to rig, too big to rig. [cheers and applause] Early voting is underway so you know what you have to do. So Christians, get everyone you know and vote. You have to vote or we're not going to have the life that we should have, a life of prosperity and hope, a life of beauty. We're not going to have it. We're going to be fighting for our lives. These people have—They mean serious business. They've—they've—I honestly believe in many cases they're sick. And we cannot let this happen because it was our religion that kept our country together for many years. It was our religion that kept it together. And they're trying to take that away and they're trying to destroy our country. After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years of the history of our country.
With your help from now until election day, we will redeem America's promise. We will put America first and we will take back the nation that we love. [cheers and applause] November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country and together we will make America powerful again. [cheers and applause] We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. [cheers and applause] Thank you very much. God bless you all. God bless you all. Thank you. Thank you, everybody.

    TRUMP: Wow, thank you very much, everybody. Oh, this is a nice crowd. Thank you.
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Well, a very, very special hello to Greensboro. Hello Greensboro. [cheers and applause] And another hello to North Carolina, because I've been at North Carolina a lot lately, you probably see. I followed that horrible storm and then I came back and we spent a lot of time here yesterday. I met some incredible people. What they've done is unbelievable. They haven't had much help from our government in Washington, I can tell you that. [booing] But come January 20th when you take office you're going to be seeing a lot of me. [cheers and applause] We're going to fix it up and make it better than ever. And I'm thrilled to be back in this incredible state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. And that's what you are. And I'd like to begin by asking a question. Are you better off now than you were four years ago?
CROWD: NO!
TRUMP: I don't think so. I don't think so. So I'm here today with a message of hope for all Americans. With your vote this election I will end inflation. I will stop the invasion of criminals into our country. [cheers and applause] And I will bring back, as your president, the American dream. We're going to bring it back. Our country is being crippled and destroyed by Kamala Harris—[booing] but it does not have to be this way. It won't be this way for long, hopefully what we've put up with, with the two of them. What we put up with the two of them with your support on November 5th, America will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer, and stronger than ever before. [cheers and applause] This election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of incompetence, failure, and disaster, or whether we'll begin the four greatest years in the history of our country. We'll do something that nobody will even believe. [cheers and applause] After all of the catastrophes that she has caused. Kamala, Kamala, ayayay [sic]. She can't say one thing. Not one thing did she'd do differently. They said, ""Would you do anything differently?"" ""Well, I can't really think of anything."" She's terrible. We need smart people. Now it's time for smart people. Not time for these people. [cheers and applause]
So I'm asking you to be excited about the future of our country again. And this will be America's new Golden Age. We're going to turn it around so fast your head will spin. Going to stop all of this craziness. [cheers and applause] Every problem facing us can be solved. But now the fate of our nation is in your hands in North Carolina. You have to stand up and you have to tell Kamala Harris that you've had enough. You can't take it anymore. We're not going to take it anymore. You're the worst vice president in the history of our country. And you're aligned with the worst president in the history of our country, who by the way likes me more than he likes her. But I won't say that. Kamala, you're fired. Get out, Kamala. Get out. Get out. [cheers and applause]
No, I think she probably does. I think he likes me slightly more. He hates me. You know, but when you think of what happened to him, think about it. He was doing okay and then he had sort of a bad debate and his numbers went down a little bit. And that's to be expected. And then they went to him and they really just took the presidency away from him. And he's got a lot of anger in his heart. He's got a lot of hatred in his heart. And much of it goes to her, because she was the first one out. She failed. 22 people who going for the Democrat nomination, right, and she was the first one. Think of it, she was the first one out and now they're a threat to democracy as they like to say. ""They're a threat to democracy."" But nobody would've thought that was possible.
And now she's cratering in the polls. You know, you see it, because they're learning who she is. She's a radical left lunatic. Yesterday I was here in North Carolina, outside Asheville where I witnessed the terrible devastation of Hurricane Helene. To every family who was lost a loved one or a home or they lost so much. Our hearts are with you and we are praying for you. The polls are open for early voting in North Carolina. And every day from now until November 2nd. And then on November 5th, oh. [cheers and applause] If you think about it, that has a chance to be the biggest day in American history. That could be a very exciting day. It's going to be the most important election in American history. I really believe it, because our country has lost its way. We are a failing nation. I don't like saying that, but we are indeed a failing nation. What a nice crowd this is. [cheers and applause] Wow, a lot of people. No, we don't like saying it, but it's—
CROWD: TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!
TRUMP: Thank you. Great.
What people, what people. We are going to take care of you. We're going to work together. We won twice here and we won twice everywhere, if you want to really know. We won twice everywhere. Too big to rig. We got to make it too big to rig. Everybody get out. But we're gonna make it too big to rig. But if you're displaced due to the storm, you do not have to return to your home county to vote. You can request a ballot to your temporary housing location and go to trumpvote2024.com/nc for more details.
You know what the amazing thing in the fake news is picking up? That's a lot of fake news tonight. [booing] That's a lot. And up there I would say you have about 9% of decent people. It's like about 9%. It's unbelievable. Boy, it would be nice. You know what? If we had an honest press, a press that wrote the truth, we would be so much further along as a country. [cheers and applause] But that's a big group back there. You know where Kamala is today? They don't want to tell you. She's—No, no, no. You don't know where she is. You know where she is? She's sleeping. She took a day off. She's got no energy at all. Her speeches last for about 15 minutes. Peter knows that by Peter. Her speeches last for about 15, 20 minutes. She's out of there.
So think of this, we have 14 days to the most important election in the history of our country. It's actually only important for us. It's important. For them I don't think it's that important. I really don't think it's that important. But you know what she did? She took a day off. How do you take a day off? 14 days, you don't take days off, right? I've gone 52 days now I got 14 more. We don't take days off. We got to win this thing. If we don't win it, our country's in big trouble. [cheers and applause] Our country's in big trouble. No, I heard it today and she's taking another day off tomorrow, they say. What the hell? Maybe she knows something that we don't know. Do you think she knows some kind of result that we don't know about? Maybe. Maybe she knows something. I doubt it. No, she's bad news. With your help 14 days from now we're going to win North Carolina. [cheers and applause] We're going to defeat Kamala Harris. And we're going to make America great again. We're going to make it so great, right?
This state was once the beating heart of American manufacturing. You know that. You know what happened. But year after year, globalist after globalist, radical left politician after radical left politician. Kamala Harris and her party sold you out, allowed your jobs to be plundered and stolen from you by other countries. After NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization some of the worst things that ever happened to this country, North Carolina lost over 300,000 manufacturing jobs like taking candy from a baby. Including 60% of its furniture manufacturing jobs. You know, I used to come here to buy furniture. I'd come here. The artists you had that were artisans that were incredible. I'd like to see a new handle on the chair. And you'd have a guy, ""Oh, yes sir, ding, ding, ding, ding."" I mean the most incredible talent. But stupid politicians took that away from you. Really stupid, horrible politicians. [booing]
They took it away. They took it away. It went to China and lots of other places. And you heard when I bought some furniture, the chairs would break. People would sit in the chairs, they'd break. I end up getting sued all the time. [laughing] I like North Carolina much better, if that's okay. [cheers and applause] Under Kamala, the United States lost 50,000 manufacturing jobs just this year alone. I don't even mention Biden anymore. I don't know what the hell's going on there. Who do you tell? Who's running this place? You know we have—We're close to a nuclear war and we don't know who the hell's running our country.
CROWD MEMBER: Obama.
TRUMP: Is it him? He goes, ""Obama's, running it."" Obama. That's another beauty, Obama. He did great, didn't he? he Did great. If you like a divided country, he was a great—He was fabulous, Obama. He was a real beauty. But under the Trump administration we're going to take back what's ours. We're going to take it back. [cheers and applause] We're going to bring it all back. We're going to end the looting, ransacking, raping, and pillaging of North Carolina in our whole country, because you're one state. But this has happened to many states. Look at what's happened in Michigan with the automobiles. I mean, they were the capital of the world for automobiles. Now they're really just hanging by a thread. And because of me, I just stopped the largest plant anywhere in the world being built in Mexico, owned by China. They were going to make cars.
And they were going to—You know this story. A year ago they announced, ""Largest plant in the world."" They were going to make cars, sell them into the United States and destroy Detroit, Michigan, and all of Michigan. They were going to make more cars in that one plant than all of Michigan makes as a whole. And I said, ""You're not going to do it."" And I said, ""You know what? I'm going to run for president and I'm going to put tariffs on that damn plant. And you're not going to do it."" And—[cheers and applause] I just heard last week they've abandoned the plant, because of Trump. Because they think we're going to get elected. And they say, ""If Trump gets elected, we're going to lose our ass. And we're not going to do it."" So they decided they're not going to build the plant.
But you know what? If she gets in, they'll start the plant like your—like your head will spin. And they'll be selling hundreds of thousands, millions of cars into our country with that big monstrous plant. There are a number of plants. They're all stopped. Every one of them. Because they think I'm going to come in impose 100, maybe 200 or do whatever's necessary. They're not going to have one car come into our country and destroy Michigan and South Carolina and Tennessee—[cheers and applause] and a little bit of North Carolina. But you know, South Carolina has been very big with that. But we're not going to let them destroy our country, our states that do the auto things. You do a little bit of it and sometimes a lot depending on your mood.
You have a lot of things in the state. You cover a lot of territory. Peter, they cover a lot of territory in this state. But the one that I liked best, I loved, and I really mean it, I loved what you did for furniture. Isn't that terrible? I had such a heart for furniture here. It's hard to come back. It's hard to come back. But we're going to bring it back. We're going to bring all of it back. More than you ever had before. [cheers and applause] We're going to bring it all back. We're going to bring it all back. And if she—if she comes—I'll tell you what, if she becomes president of this country, this country is finished. [booing] This country is finished. And I don't like to be that way. And I wasn't that way even with Crooked Hillary. I wasn't talking that way. This woman is a radical left lunatic who has no right even running. She doesn't deserve to be able to run. She came in last in the primary. Now she's running, because they want to be politically correct. I'm not going to let this happen.
Starting in January, we will give our companies the lowest taxes, the lowest energy cost, the lowest regulatory burdens, and free access to the best and biggest market in the planet. But if we keep going like this, we're not going to have the best market anymore. We're going to be like Venezuela on steroids, okay. That's what we're going to be. And I used to say that. And if I don't get elected, that's what's going to happen. You're going to end up in a 1929 style depression. If you look at what her policies are, she has no idea about business, she has no idea—Frankly, she has no idea about anything. She destroyed San Francisco, which was really the best city, I think maybe the best city in the country. She destroyed it. She helped destroy California along with Gavin Newscum [sic], who was one of the worst governors in the history of our country. But only if they make their products here, they're going to get these benefits. Only if they make their products here in America. And they hire American workers to do the job. [cheers and applause] It's very simple. And if these companies don't make their products here, then they will pay a quite stiff tariff. Nice tariff. We're taking a lot. You know how much China paid us during my time? Hundreds of billions of dollars. No other president got them to pay not 10 cents. Go through all these great presidents. Oh, they were so great. Not 10 cents. China didn't pay 10 cents. And they were ripping us left and right. That's why I got into politics, if you want to call it that. I don't feel I'm a politician, but what the hell? Call me whatever you want. But it really was trade. And you know what? It morphed from trade. And now I say most important thing to me, trade. Always trade with me. We're going to bring jobs back like nobody's ever seen. But the border, it's so horrible what they're doing to us on the border. To me, you know, if you look at the polls, it's the economy and it's inflation, and then it's the border. I think the border is the biggest.
CROWD: BUILD THE WALL! BUILD THE WALL! BUILD THE WALL!
TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you.
So I think the border has become—To me, it's the worst thing I've ever seen where we're allowing criminals to come in. Hundreds of thousands of criminals to pour into our country. They come from jails, they come from places unknown, from countries we've never even heard of. 181 countries were represented as of last night. Think of it, 180. To me, number one is our border. We don't want murderers. We don't want people from mental institutions coming in. We don't want people coming in who are terrorists. And I think it's number one. And then number two would be economy. And number three is inflation. Or you could put them together, do it any way you want. But I think that the border is the biggest threat to this country, other than of course some horrible, horrible radical left lunatic politicians that we have. That's a pretty big threat to our country also.
But I will never apologize for defending America. I will protect our workers. I will protect our jobs. I will protect our borders. [cheers and applause] I will protect our families. And I will protect the birthright of our children to live in the richest and most powerful nation on the face of the earth. And we'll have it back there very soon. We're going to have it back there very soon. With four more years of Kamala Harris, North Carolina will be an economic wasteland. That's what's going to happen. The rest of your companies are going to move out. Everybody knows that. The smart people know she's the only one that doesn't know it. Low IQ. She's a low IQ individual. And we've had that for four years. We don't need another four. No country could take that. Can you imagine what President Xi—you know, I got to know him very well. He's a fierce individual. The press, the fake news hates when I say that he's a brilliant man. He runs 1.4 billion people with an iron fist. If I say he's a brilliant man, they say, ""He called him a—"" Okay, he's not a smart man at all. These people are crazy back there, I'm telling you. Am I allowed to say he's smart? Is he smart? He's a smart man. He's a fierce man. I got along with him very well. Putin. These are people that are tough people. Kim Jong-Un, North Korea. Nuclear weapons all over the place. I said, ""You ever do anything else? Go to a game? Do something?"" He loves producing nuclear weapons. That's what he likes producing. And he's got a lot of them. And he has no respect for our leadership now.
And he doesn't respect—He didn't respect Obama. He thought Obama was a real jerk. A real jerk. And I think he's a real jerk, because I've watched him campaign over the last couple of days—Over the last couple of days, I watched him campaign. What a divider he is, right? What a divider he is. He divide [sic] this country. He couldn't care less, him and his little group of people. He was terrible. But I've watched what he's done. He's trying to campaign, because she's incapable of campaigning. So they send him in to try. He's not going to do it. You know who he helped? He helped Hillary Clinton. How did that work out? He came out for Hillary. [booing] So they sent out the same thing. But the fake news, they don't talk about that. They said, ""Oh, they're bringing out Barack Hussein Obama."" Oh, Barack—remember Rush? Barack Hussein Obama. Rush Limbaugh. We miss him, don't we? Don't we miss him, Peter. They're bringing out Obama. I say, ""Oh, they did that with Hillary. Clinton. Good, I'm glad they're bringing him out."" The reason they're bringing him out, he doesn't even want to do it.
I think he's exhausted. I watched him talking. I think the guy's exhausted. And I never say a guy's looking old, but he's looking a little bit older, isn't he? [laughing] There's nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong. But he's exhausted. He's exhausted. But the reason they bring him out, and other people, they're bringing out all these other people. Nobody goes to their rallies. Nobody goes there. So you know what they do? They bring in so-called stars. Stars that I've never even heard of. These are not stars to me. These are not stars to me. But they bring out some people. And what happens is the star comes in, they get a little bit of a crowd. They don't get crowds like this. And they have guitars, I don't, okay. I got nothing up here. And they bring him out and they get an audience. They perform for a couple of minutes. And then they leave. And then the candidate gets up. There's nobody in the room. They got to do it the other way around. Let her speak first.
But they bring him out because they need help, because she cannot talk for more than 15 minutes. And when the teleprompter goes out. Remember ""32, 32, 32 days."" [cheers and applause] 32—I said, ""What the hell is going on with her?"" I was watching. You always want to watch your opponent, right? I was watching her and she started doing that 32. She was just about gone. And then that sucker snapped back on. They go out—It's a dangerous business. If you're a teleprompter reader it could be dangerous, because no matter how good these guys—I have a great guy, but about 5% of the time you lose a teleprompter.
Sometimes it breaks down and snaps. We call it a snap back. It's gone. And now you're on your way and then you go ping and it's back. But no matter how good they are, you lose it 5% of the time. And I thought she lost it. And I just wanted to see a little bit longer. I just wanted to see, because she was over. But if you're—you'd like to go into politics, you got to be able to make a speech without reading a teleprompter. Because if you need a teleprompter like her, you're in trouble. [cheers and applause]
We got two of them, Biden, and her. How about Biden? She'd make his, ""Hello."" And then he could never find—I don't want to hit him too hard anymore though, because you know? I really want to keep it this way where he likes me better than her, because I think it's—[laughing]No, but think of it. They stole the presidency of the United States. They took it. I don't want to use the word coup. Nobody knows what the hell that means. It was a coup, but nobody knows. Here's simpler, they stole the presidency. They walked in, they said, ""You're getting out."" I mean, he didn't have to do that. And then they say, ""He was so brave in getting out. He was so brave. It was so wonderful that he got out. He's a great American hero."" They threw him out. They took him out.
Crazy Nancy Pelosi, she's crazy as—She did a nut job, by the way. And Schumer, I was with Schumer the other night at the big Catholic dinner. How did I do with that dinner? [cheers and applause] The Al Smith dinner, big dinner. 77 years, almost without fail every candidate goes to that out of respect to Catholics. And she said she's not going. It never happens. It hadn't happened in decades. And the last person—We know who that was. The last person lost—let's say he lost everything but one state. You know what state it was? Minnesota, the home of the worst, the stupidest man I've ever seen run for office. Is there something wrong with that guy? He's always bouncing. He's going with his heart. [gestures hitting his chest, leaning over] Yeah, I never got that. But there's something wrong with that guy, I'm telling you.
And you know, that should enter in—And I have somebody the exact opposite. A brilliant guy, J.D. Vance, who's really very solid, very solid. [cheers and applause] Kamala's inflation has already cost the typical family over $30,000 on higher prices. And now she wants to raise the typical family's taxes by nearly $3,000 a year. Take a look at this.
[start of video montage]
UNNAMED ANNOUNCER: Kamala Harris is going to significantly raise taxes.
HARRIS: Taxes are gonna have to go up.
UNNAMED ANNOUNCER: Kamala's plan will raise family's taxes by nearly $2,600 a year. Under Kamala, prices have already soared. Now, she'd make it worse with even higher taxes.
HARRIS: Taxes are gonna have to go up.
UNNAMED ANNOUNCER: President Trump will cut taxes again. No taxes on tips, overtime, or social security.
[cheers and applause]
TRUMP: I'm Donald J. Trump and I approved this message.
[end of video]
TRUMP: Thank you. Remember when I said no taxes on tips? And then like a month later, she goes, ""We will have no taxes on tips."" And the place was booing her. They said, ""A little bit late."" Anyway, and you never heard it. I haven't even heard her say it again after that, because that just shows you the kind of dedication they have to their statements. No, she's the taxing queen. And she's also demanding a shocking 33% tax hike in all domestic production along with the largest capital gains tax hike in history. This is going to be the largest tax anybody's ever had to pay. And every business is going to leave our country and go to another country. They don't have to stay here. They have a lot of opportunity. It used to be you'd go to a different state, now they go to a different country. They'll go to Asia, they'll go to Europe, they'll go to different countries.
And you've had that. And all you're doing is forcing them out and with them goes the jobs and the money. By contrast, I will massively cut taxes for workers and small businesses and do just as you saw, no tax on tips. [cheers and applause] No tax on overtime. And no tax on social security benefits. I will make—Here's something that I think is going to be great. Think of this. And I just made a decision to do it a little bit differently, because I'm only going to do it if they build that particular product, namely an automobile, in the United States. Listen to this. I will make interest on car loans fully tax deductible, because affording a car is essential to restoring the American dream. [cheers and applause]
So I had calls from the biggest people in Wall Street, ""Where did you come up with these ideas? The no tax on Tips. Who gave that to you?"" Actually, it was a waitress at Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. I didn't pay a consultant $5 million to come up with the idea. Waitress said, ""It's terrible the way they're treating us with tips."" And a lot of them, I mean a lot of people don't report those tips anyway, really? I guess it's a weird kind of a thing. ""How do you tax it?"" Somebody puts $5 in their pocket. Let's see. But she gave me the idea. But they said, ""How did you come up with this thing on deductibility of interest on automobiles?""
I said it was just an idea I had, but I had a better idea because here's what I'm doing. I want it to benefit—I don't want it to benefit other countries. I want it to benefit us, so its deductibility of interest is great, but only if the car is manufactured in the United States. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Is that a great idea? [cheers and applause] Why the hell would we give them taxes if they manufacture the car in China, or Japan, or lots of other places that stole our business over the years? Mexico is a very big threat. I'm telling you, it's a big threat. So, we're doing that now and I think that's going to be great for Detroit. And we're leading in Michigan, by the way, by good margin because of the brilliant mandate that next week you're going to be forced to drive all electric. Everybody's going to have an electric car. [booing]
They don't go far. They cost too much. And by the way, they're great. You know what? They're great. And Elon makes the best of them, as far as I'm concerned. [cheers and applause] And he'll be the first to admit it's a certain market and it's a certain market for certain things, but you have to have gasoline-powered—Here we have more gasoline, we have more oil and gas, we have more liquid gold than anybody in the world, and we're trying to go all electric. So, we want that. We want hybrids. We don't want hydrogen cars. We don't want hydrogen. Would anybody like a hydrogen car? You know what a hydrogen car [sic]? It's a great car. It's a wonderful car, except if it happens to explode, then you are unrecognizable.
They said they have it down, they don't think more than 10 or 20 will explode a year, but if it does, you're gonzo. So, we told them, ""Let's not spend a lot of money on that."" That's one of those things, no matter how good it is, you don't want it. But other than that, they said it works quite well. On day one of the Trump administration, I will terminate Kamala's insane electric vehicle mandate and we will end the Green New Scam once and for all. [cheers and applause] The Green New Scam, you know whose idea that was, right? AOC, young girl. Very nice person. [booing] She never even studied the environment in college. Average student at best. She was an average student.
She walked in one day, she said, ""We're going to all be dead in 12 years because the oceans are rising."" Well, it's been more than 12 years. What's going on? No, we have a much bigger threat. We have a threat called nuclear weapons and having stupid people running our country. And if you talk about global warming, that's the real global warming, not this nonsense of the ocean's going to rise over the next 400 years by one-eighth of an inch, and we're going to be wiped out. No, we have a threat right now. We better get smart because we're very close to World War III. If you take a look at what's going on, we're very close. So, we have a couple of different areas, but we'll have more than that.
And you can look at the side, look at the teams. They're already being divided up. You see what's going on with Iran, and Russia, and China, and now other countries are adding into that group, North Korea. No, no, no. We have very stupid people letting this happen. That should have never happened. Now they want to attack our dollar. They want to take our dollar away from us. They want to take our dollar and not have that be the standard any longer. And that would be like losing a world war, then we would be indeed third world status. And if I'm elected, they're not doing that. I guarantee you that. No chance. [cheers and applause]
Just like Russia would've never attacked Ukraine. Zero. By the way, even a Democrat congressman was on television, and many Democrats are saying that. And by the way, for four years, they didn't. So, it's not like, oh, gee, they won't. For four years, they didn't. I think what happened is when Putin saw how weak we were, how pathetic we were with the stupid Milley and these generals that aren't even generals as far as I was concerned. What a stupid group of people they were. Mattis, Milley. You know the real ones, the ones that I used to defeat ISIS? We defeated ISIS. They were the real generals. [cheers and applause] They were the real generals. They weren't the television generals. They weren't the dumb ones. They were the ones that were warriors.
But we'll quickly become energy independent, and we will frack, frack, frack, and we will drill, baby, drill. We're going to drill. [cheers and applause] And in 12 months from January 20, that's the day we take office, I will cut your energy prices by 50, 5-0% [sic], 50% within one year. And we can do it. [cheers and applause] No other country can say it. Very few countries can say it, but no other country can say that we have more liquid gold. We're going to drill. Your prices are going to come down. Then everything else is going to start coming down, too, because you're paying too much. You know what people tell me mostly? Groceries. A simple word, groceries. The overall effect of bacon, and lettuce, and all of this stuff is the biggest, the worst we've ever had. We've never had anything like it.
How about interest rates? When I was president—Think of this: When I was president, interest was 2.2%. Now it's 10% and you can't get any money, so it's much higher than 10%. And I have really good news, because I keep hearing people say, ""2.50, 2.25 a gallon."" So the other day I'm looking at some things and some statistics. So, we had $1.84 a gallon. That was the real price that you had. [cheers and applause] $1.84 compared to now it's about $4, but it was up to $5, and California was 7 and $8. We were at 1.84, and everybody was happy. It was nice to drive to Washington D.C. But the problem with Washington D.C., too dangerous. We're going to clean that city up, but we're going to make it greater. We're going to make it safe so you can go down and you can see the Washington Monument. [cheers and applause]
You can go see honest Abe and you can see Thomas Jefferson. They wanted to rip that down. Remember, they wanted to rip down the Thomas Jefferson? And I said, ""That's not going to happen."" Remember I passed that law, the old law that was—They came into town, they wanted to rip down our statues. And I said, ""Well, do they have a point?"" A couple of them were a little rough. Then I said, ""Well, now I heard they want to rip down honest Abe Lincoln."" That's—Now you're getting a little bit nasty. And I went out and we were tough. I said, ""Give me that law. I want to sign it immediately."" We took it. It was an old law from early 1900s.
And it basically said that if you so much as look at or touch any monument anywhere in the country, federal monument anywhere in the country, you get immediately 10 years in jail with no early getting out stuff. [cheers and applause] And I signed it with a news conference. Remember I said, ""Anybody that wants to play games with me, you can play games, but it's not going to work out well."" And we had a lot of people in Washington, they were having a lot of fun thinking about which statue they're going to take down. And as soon as I signed it, I watched the backs of those people, I don't want to use the word asses. I watched the backs of those people leaving town. They all left town very nicely. We had no problem.
But just recently, a month ago, they were in Washington and they're spray-painting beautiful limestone lions and doing tremendous damage, fighting with the police. And by the way, nothing happened to those people. You know, when you spray paint over limestone, you'll see it in 100 years from now because limestones are very poor. I was really good at real estate and building. Limestone's very poor, as poor stone. And that stuff goes right into that. You can't get it out unless you want to do it with a chisel and that's not going to work. And you're going to see that in 100 years from now—And it's very, very sad. And nothing happened to those people. Nothing.
I watched it very closely, and they did great destruction and they had fistfights with our cops. They had fistfights. They were rolling on the grass and fighting our police. Nothing happened to them. Under Kamala's economy, millions of Americans are suffering because of inflation. They're losing their jobs. They can't afford housing, groceries or a car, and yet Kamala is importing millions of illegals across our borders and giving them taxpayer benefits at your expense, [booing] while taking the jobs from African-Americans and from Hispanic Americans at levels that we have not seen. You're going to see reports coming out very soon. They're trying to hold it until after the election. Hopefully, it won't matter because we're going to win by so much. [cheers and applause]
But let them give you the reports of what's happening to our African-American population, our Hispanic population. They are taking the jobs of our African-Americans and Hispanic Americans, and it's tremendous numbers. And they're going to release these numbers sometime after the election, and everyone's going to be upset and nothing they could do. You're going to have to wait four more years. And I'm not sure we can wait four more years, because I don't know that we'll have a country in four more years. So they better—you ought to start looking at that to the fake news media. Show them what's happening to the Black population and to the Hispanic population, with these people that are coming into our country illegally.
You are witnessing the economic oppression of Americans to reward and enrich illegal aliens. You know, they come into hotels, and they stay in hotels, in luxury hotels paid for by the government. And they walk past our veterans who are sleeping on the street right in front of that hotel. [booing] But all of that stops two weeks from tonight. It all stops. [cheers and applause] For four straight years, Kamala Harris has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from prisons and jails, from insane asylums and mental institutions all around the world, from Venezuela to the Congo, not just South America. This is all over the world.
We're the dumping ground for the whole world to put their criminals into. And she has resettled them into your communities to prey upon innocent Americans. And that's what they're doing. You just take a look at what's going on in Colorado. Take a look at what's going on there. They're taking over. They're in the real estate business like I am. The only difference is I go out and borrow nice money from a bank. They do it with guns. You see what's going on in Aurora? But it's not just Aurora. It's hundreds of communities. They don't want to talk about it, because they don't want to destroy the reputation of the community. And they better start talking about it because they won't have a community.
When I win on November 5th, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins. It's going to begin. [cheers and applause]
[stepping away from podium, pointing to crowd member] Are you from yesterday? Is that you? Is that you from yesterday? Yesterday?
CROWD: TRUMP! TRUMP TRUMP!
TRUMP: One of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gang that Kamala has imported into our country. She's, ""Let him just come in."" Remember, she's a stupid person. [laughing] Open borders. Open borders. As soon as I saw it, I said, ""Well, wait a minute. I know the world."" I know many of the leaders of the world, other than the ones that were changed. Not that many. I know them. They're smart. They're street wise. Very street wise people. I said, ""Wait a minute, they're going to let all their prisoners out into our country."" When you have open borders, there's no check-in, there's no vetting.
And very importantly, border patrol, they're phenomenal. They endorsed me last week with the strongest endorsement that you've ever seen. [cheers and applause] Unanimous. Unanimous. And in the endorsement, they said, ""She's so bad, there's never been anybody bad."" That by itself should cause her—Thousands of people voted for me, unanimous endorsement of the border patrol, because we had the safest border—bring down my favorite chart. I love this chart. I sleep with this chart. I kiss this chart every night. I love it. I love this chart. I love that. Beautiful. Every night I roll it up and I kiss it, because I wouldn't be here right now without that chart.
I look to my right, ping [sic], and I said, ""What the hell happened?"" But look at that arrow on the bottom. That's when I left office. That's the day I left office right there. That's the lowest we've ever had. This was done by border patrol, by the way. And look what happened after I left. There was an explosion like one of Elon's rocket ships. Look at that. How good is Elon, by the way? Is he good? [cheers and applause] You know, here's a guy, when you talk about—He is so smart. We are inside beautiful place, beautiful arena packed, nice, probably 71 degrees. We finally have air conditioning. Some of these things don't have air conditioning. It's brutal.
Congratulations to the people who own this place, whoever the hell owns it. We appreciate the air con—but it's like 71 degrees. It's beautiful. Elon is right now in Pennsylvania politicking, because he thinks this is the most important election in history. And he says, ""We won't have a country."" How cool is that? [cheers and applause] And he's registering voters. He's an amazing guy. How cool was the rocket ship that landed the other day? [cheers and applause] I never saw it. I don't want to—if you heard it, just turn off your ears for a second. I'm talking to a very important guy and I have the no sound on the teller muted, and I'm looking at the teller and talking to this guy.
Very important, but quite boring to be honest with you. I hope he doesn't watch me say this ,because he'll be able to figure out who it is. But anyway, I said, ""Wait a minute, would you hold on please, just for a second?"" Because I'm looking at the screen. I'm seeing this 20-story, huge tube pouring down and you know, fire's pouring out of it. And it used to be white, but the heat is thousands of degrees coming down. They say thousands and thousands, so it's been beat up in that trip down. And I see this massive tube is coming down, and the fire's burning, and brights [inaudible] exploding all over the place. I said, ""Oh, my, this is terrible. It's going to crash. What the hell is it?"" I wasn't even sure. Maybe it was a movie.
But I'm looking, it's the news. And I see it and then all of a sudden it's going to hit the gantry, and a flame comes out of the left, and pushes it over like it was nothing. I say, ""What the hell?"" And then bwah [sic]—And then these two giant arms come. They envelop it like a beautiful—I won't say it. I get myself into too much trouble. [cheers and applause] When I say that stuff, it's so great. I'd like to, but I'm not going to because I'm going to be politically correct, if you don't mind. You know what Elon says? ""Like two giant chopsticks."" See, wouldn't I be better off if I said that? [laughing] Wouldn't that, Mr. Wall? This guy is the greatest guy. Stand up. I love this guy. [cheers and applause] Comes to so many of these.
And he's a very successful guy, but he likes these rallies. He's had a lot of them. And we have the ladies from North Carolina here too. Would you stand up? [cheers and applause] I call them the beautiful ladies from North Carolina. And you're not allowed to call ladies beautiful anymore. It's the end of your political career. If you say, ""Aren't they beautiful?"" That's the end of your political career, but who cares? You are beautiful. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. [cheers and applause] What number is this? 230 or 240 or something? And they're happily married, because I've met their husbands. Their husbands are really nice. I don't know how the hell they put up with this stuff, but at least here we're in North Carolina. How long a trip was this? Pretty short, right?
CROWD MEMBER: Two and a half hours.
TRUMP: Well, that's a long time, two and a half. That's like short compared to Texas, California. Thank you very much. It's a great honor. It's always nice to them. They're always so brightly dressed. They got plenty of cash. They're so brightly and beautifully dressed all the time. And quaffed, they're beautifully quaffed. Thank you very much. Great honor. Thank you. And we have our front road Jacks. We have our front row Jacks and Joes. Thank you very much. What happened? You're not in the front row. These must be very powerful people in the front. Look at these people. Who are these people? They kept the wall back there. Wow, we got to figure this out. That young man must be a very powerful guy, but we appreciate it.
We've had a lot of rallies and we're going to have our biggest of all at Madison Square Garden. [cheers and applause] We're going to make a play for New York. Hasn't been won in many, many decades. But with what's going on in New York between the illegal migrants and the crime they're causing, and hurting people so badly, and all of the problems in New York, we're going to give it a hell of a shot. So, we took Madison Square Garden. We filled it up. Think of this, sold out in three hours. Done. Can you imagine? [cheers and applause] If a normal politician—And I don't say this in any way, I just say if a politician—Take our best politician. After me, take our best politician. If you had 250, 300 people, you'd have 300 people in a ballroom or something.
Ronald Reagan would have 350 people, 400 people. We sell out these things 25,000 people at Madison Square Garden, because we use the floor, the basketball. So, we have the whole thing. Holds 18 or 19,000. We have the floor and it's sold out in three hours. So, that's a great honor. But we're going to do—do a big one in the Atlanta arena. We're trying to sign the Philadelphia arena. We had tremendous success in Long Island, where the ice hockey team plays, the Islanders. And we could have sold that thing out four times. It was incredible. So, we're doing them. And it's sad because we're sort of wrapping it up, you know that, right?
We've been doing this now for a long time. We had two unbelievable elections. We had two. No, no, well. But we are. I didn't even think of it. I was being interviewed by a very good person today, actually. And that person said, ""When you did Madison Square Garden, it's in a week."" They said, ""Is that sort of wrapping it all up, right?"" And I said, ""I never thought of it that way, but I guess you could."" We have a few days left after that, but we sort of are. When you think we've been doing it from 2015, and now we're where we are. So, we're talking about nine years, almost 10 years by the time we do it.
And there's something—and think of what we've done. This is the greatest movement in political history. [cheers and applause] I mean, there's never been anything like that. The greatest movement in political history. Oh, look, there's Uncle Sam back there. Look at that guy. He shook my hand. This guy's got the hardest handshake. My hand is still recovering from his handshake. Uncle Sam, how are you? And I have no idea who he is, I promise you. Somebody says, ""Oh, do you pay these people?"" I don't pay him. I don't pay the Wall, I don't pay Uncle Sam, but they're incredible patriots. And you know what? They're very smart people. They're incredible people. But this is like a football game to some. They come in, these guys, they're accountants. They head accounting firms, law firms, and they got the name of some football player in the back. I don't know if I could do that.
Well, maybe Lawrence Taylor, he's my friend. I'll come in with a Lawrence Taylor. [cheers and applause] These are all guys. We have a lot of endorsements from athletes, that I can tell you. But thank you, Uncle Sam. But it's sort of interesting. I never thought of it. We're wrapping it up. We're wrapping up something that has been incredible. There's never been anything like this, the rallies, the size of them, the enthusiasm. And we have more enthusiasm now than we did for 2016 or 2020. But we really started—we really started in 2015, about a year before, a little less than a year before. We started in 2015. And it's been really amazing. It's been great to be with you, and now we want to close it out with a beautiful bang. And we want to straighten out the country.
CROWD MEMBER: [inaudible] We pray for you.
TRUMP: Thank you, darling. I pray for you, too. Thank you. Thank you. [cheers and applause] But it's been like a movement of love. And—and you know, it's like—When we first started, there used to be some fights and there were problems where you have fight. Not much, but we had some. And I don't want to jinx it by saying, but it's been, it's been like love. It's been amazing. It is. And you know what? The people back there, when I say things, if I'm a little bit off, they'll go headlines, headlines. And I don't mean to be a little bit off, but this is the single-greatest political movement in the history of our country. There's never been anything like that. [cheers and applause]
And, and if it wasn't, if it were just slightly behind some other movement that nobody could even come close to talking about, they would have headlines. I have to be very careful when I say things. So, he said that. And he said, ""Is this wrapping it up?"" And I never thought of it. I didn't think of it that way. We're in the heart of battle and we have to win our country. And then we're going to have four great years. And that's a different kind of a battle. But for what we're doing for the campaigning, this would be pretty much—we're 14 days from wrapping it up. And we're going to have different kinds of get-togethers. And hopefully, it's going to be get-togethers of success. We're going to base it on success. We're going to have great success with this country. [cheers and applause]
We're going to bring back our businesses. We're going to stop crime in the streets. We're going to close up our borders. We're going to let people come in to our country, but we need people to take all these jobs that will—We're going to be creating a lot of jobs just by the very smart use of tariffs, taxes, and incentives, just like I told you. Just come up with one. And literally, I did it with a friend of mine who's a great businessperson. I said, ""What do you think of the idea, like the idea of the deduction for a car, interest deduction for a car?"" But then I said, ""But to get it, you have to build a car in the United States."" Who would think of that?
It sounds simple, like the paperclip. It's very simple. Somebody came up 129 years ago or something, they came up with a paperclip. And other people looked at it and they said, ""How the hell—Why didn't I think of this idea?"" And now you'll have everybody come out and say, ""We're going to deduct interest."" But you know what? It doesn't have the same ring. No, that's a big deal. We're going to make so many cars in Detroit with that. That's going to be so big. But I said, ""Wait a minute, if I do this, what are we going to do? Make more cars in China?"" You know, China, I put a tariff on Chinese. Cut 27.5%. And because of that, they're not flooding our country.
They're destroying Europe. They're just flooding Europe with cars. But we've kept our car companies, but it's a fraction of what it used to be. We had the glory days. We were making everybody's cars. The Cadillac was the most beautiful—To my father having a Cadillac, he'd get a Cadillac every two years. That was his definition of luxury. ""I just want a Cadillac every two years"" And today, you know, they don't talk so much about that.
CROWD MEMBER: What about our military? [inaudible]
TRUMP: We're going to take care of our military better. We're going to take care of our military better than anybody. [cheers and applause] You know, with our military, we took care of our veterans better than anybody has ever taken care. We took care of our veterans. We got a 92% approval rating, and now it's back down to 44 or 43. We did choice. We had choice. So, if a person had to wait of a—one of our great, because I call them heroes, one of our great heroes had to wait for a doctor. If they had to wait more than one day, they go out and they get a doctor, we pay the bill. And in the end, not only was it good for them, it was also even efficient because some of these people were dying.
They'd wait for four, five, six, seven months. And we have great doctors in the VA, but the problem was the administration. And our guys did a fantastic job. We did another thing in the VA. We got rid of all the sadists and the sickos or wackos. You couldn't farm, because the civil service laws. And I got this all passed. We got this all passed in Congress. It was an amazing thing, to get it passed in Congress. They've been trying for 58 years for one and for 54 years for the other. And it worked out great. And now I understand that as of like yesterday, they're trying to get rid of, they call it choice, where you have a choice of going outside, getting a doctor.
And I understand that they're trying to end that program. They don't like that program. That this group of people that have no idea what they're doing, don't like it, so they'll go back to waiting. But we'll get it back. We'll get it back so fast your head will spin. They want to end it. They don't like it for some reason. I don't know why, but they don't like it. People were getting instant care, and it wasn't very expensive. When you take into the fact that, and just take a look at this, you have a guy, he gets sicker, sicker, sicker, sicker, then he becomes terminally ill, and they have to take care. In the end, I think it's probably cost-effective, but I don't even care about the cost in that case. We take care of our people.
Who would want to wait months to get, in some cases, a simple pill or a simple shot? And it was a terrible thing. But we had a 92% approval rating, the highest ever. The people that I had there did a fantastic job. We're going to bring it all back. We're going to bring it back fast. [cheers and applause] And one other thing, I mean, isn't it nice to have a president that doesn't have to read these stupid teleprompters? Isn't it? [cheers and applause] Sort of interesting. I haven't looked at them in the last 15 minutes. It's interesting. But I just do what we have to do. But we did another program, Right to Try. It's the greatest thing. For 51 years, they've been trying to get it, because we have the best doctors, the best lab technicians, the best labs, the best everything. And nobody could get it done, where we'd have something that really looked good for a certain disease or problem.
It really looked good, but they couldn't do anything because the FDA wouldn't be able to approve it for years. I got that number way down, by the way, but they wouldn't be able to approve it for years, and what would happen was terrible. They would go to Asia. They'd go to Europe. They'd go all over if they had money. Most of them didn't have money. They'd go home and they'd die. They'd die. So I said, ""We got to do something about this."" And they've been trying for 50 years. They couldn't get it done because the doctors didn't want it because of the liability. The insurance companies certainly didn't want it. The labs didn't want it. Nobody wanted it, but nobody—everybody, they knew it was good, but they didn't want it.
I got everybody into a room, and I said, ""Listen, we're going to sign an agreement. There's not going to be any liability to anybody. If somebody's terminally ill, they're going to sign a document that they're not going to sue the insurance company, their family. They're not going to sue anybody. They're not going to sue the doctor, the lab. They're not going to sue anybody. Everything's going to be fine, and we're going to try it and see how it works.""
It's been so successful. We have saved thousands and thousands of lives with this new—with this new medicine. [cheers and applause] It's a new age. I call it new age medicine, but we've saved thousands of people. People don't write about it. It's called right to try. A lot of people don't—I hope nobody needs it, to be honest with you, but it's been so—I've never read anything about it. They don't want to write about it, and if they don't, that's okay. The fact is that thousands of people have been saved, their lives have been saved, and many were terminal, and now they're actually okay. They're not even terminal. It's not like they have to even go. It literally cured—
And even the doctors now and the medical companies, the labs, they're really happy they did it because when you can cure somebody when they're that sick, it really shows it worked. It sort of worked out the opposite. It really shows that it worked. So right to try. It's been a great thing and we're honored to have done it.
One of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gangs that Kamala has imported into our country, the savage Venezuelan prison gang they form in the Venezuelan prisons. It's called Tren de Aragua that's taking over apartment complexes and unleashing a violent terrorist spree in our country. Let's take a look. Take a look at this.
[start of video montage]

[end of video]
TRUMP: That's what's happening. These are the people we're letting in. And you remember where she was saying that they don't commit crimes like our people. Really? These are worse than anybody. We—They make our criminals look like they're nice people. These are rough, horrible people. They could not be allowed to stay in our country.
The United States is now an occupied country in effect, but on November 5th, 2024, we will have a thing called Liberation Day. We're going to have liberation Day. [cheers and applause] In the last year alone, over 70,000 illegal aliens from China have crossed our border. You know about that. Many of them military-aged men, 70,000 in a year. 70,000, that's getting to be army territory, and that's the equivalent of over 14 brigades or five army divisions of Chinese illegals that have penetrated our country. Again, these are military aged, mostly men, almost all men. Isn't that wonderful? Isn't that nice? Under Border Czar Harris—she has no idea. The woman doesn't have a clue. Again, she's sleeping now while I'm working my ass off. [cheers and applause]
Under Border Czar Harris, there have been at least two million gotaways. That's gotaways. They come through and nobody knows where the hell they're from. And that's by the way, nobody has any idea. If they think it's two million is probably five times that amount. Two million gotaways from all over the world who charged the border and disappeared into the United States. They could be living right next to you. North Carolina, lovely house, little cabin right next to you. More than the entire active-duty force of the United States military. This is the kind of numbers we're talking about. And they're rough. They're rough people.
Who would've allowed this to happen? The only good thing coming from this crime against our country is if you happen to be the person that's running against the idiots that allowed it to take place, that's me. I'm running against them. It's good to run against it, but I'd rather not be running against it, and I'd rather not have it happen. Immediately upon taking the oath of office, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. [cheers and applause] We have no idea. We have no choice. It's not sustainable.
I will rescue every town across America that's been invaded and conquered. They're conquering. They're conquering towns. And these fools, these fools, these stupid people back there, the media, they're going to say, ""Oh, he used the word, conquer."" You know the governor of Colorado, he's a radical left Democrat, he's petrified of—He doesn't know what to do. And we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in a jail or kick them the hell out of our country as fast as we can. [cheers and applause]
And to expedite removals of Tren de Aragua and other savage gangs, I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Think of that, 1798. You know why? That's when we had real politicians, real people, real people that knew what to do, not these weak woke fools. So I have to go back to 1798. Can you believe it? But it's a strong one. Think of it. Alien Enemies Act of 1798, and they used it to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil to make our people safe. And if they come back into our country, it's an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole. [cheers and applause] And I am hereby calling for the death penalty. And we have to do this. I'm calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or an enforcement law enforcement officer. [cheers and applause]
You kill an American citizen or a law enforcement officer, you get the death penalty and we'll get that approved too, because Congress is going to approve it. They're feeling the way you are. I will end catch and release. Thank you.
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: I have to ask this man in the black. Are you the man that I met yesterday or not?
CROWD MEMBER: No, you didn't meet me but I love you, man!
TRUMP: That's a pretty—You're just as good. I met some great people yesterday. I saw the devastation. It was incredible. He just said, ""No, you didn't meet me, but I love you, man."" Thank you. That's cool. You're very cool. You are very cool. Thank you.
CROWD MEMBER: [inaudible].
TRUMP: I will end—Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. I will end all migrant flights. They fly in by plane. They come in. We only learned that less than a year ago. They said, ""We're going to start closing up the border a little bit."" Well, all they have to do—She could walk into the White House, say, ""Wake Biden up. I want him to sign something."" And all he has to do is say, ""Close the border."" He doesn't need a bill. The bill was so horrible. He says, ""Donald Trump called the Senate and said, don't pass it."" It's wonderful. I wish I could do that. Okay, not that easy. But the truth is, I had nothing to do with it, and I would be proud to do it because it was such a bad bill. But he doesn't need a bill. I didn't have a bill. I closed the board. I had the safest border. You see it.
I had the safest border in the history of our country. We now have the worst border in the history of the world. Maybe in the history of the world. And again, it's the number one thing to campaign on. I mean, I think the inflation is horrible, the economy, everything. We have a lot of bad things. The number one, you see those killers, those guys that have military style weapons, I mean, people are saying, ""Where the hell do people coming out of Venezuela, young thugs that are tough as hell, by the way, where do they get this equipment?"" But I think it's the number one thing that we're going to have it fixed. You know, I fixed it in 2016. I fixed it. I did it so good. I couldn't talk about it for the next election. My people said, ""Sir, they don't want to hear about the border.""
I said, ""What do you mean you don't want to hear? I did such a great job. I fixed it. We had the best border."" But that border was 5% of what it is now. That border was bad. It was really bad, but it wasn't very tough for me to fix. That border was nothing compared to the mess you have now. We don't have a border. And I built hundreds of miles of wall. I built much more than I said I was going to build. Then we added 200 and they didn't want to put up the slats. And you know what they did? Many of them were sold for 5 cents on the dollar. It's just so sold. [booing] I will outlaw sanctuary cities immediately, and I will ban all welfare and federal benefits for illegals. [cheers and applause]
We are running against the most radical, most incompetent, most unfit vice president running for president. Can you believe it? In the history of our country. She's totally unfit for office. No one respects her. No one trusts her. No one takes her seriously. And something is clearly wrong with her. Something is wrong with her. Something's wrong with her, and something's wrong with his vice president. He is off. She can't put two sentences together. How about 60 Minutes was that the greatest? You know, we're probably going to sue them just for the hell of it. Listen, listen. 60 Minutes, she interviews. She was so bad. She gave an answer. This never happened to me. Why does it happen? She gave an answer that was so bad that they changed it. They took it out, threw it out. They didn't edit a little bit. Take a word out. No, no, no. They took the entire—It was a long stupid—She didn't know where the hell she was going. Does she drink? Is she on drugs? I don't know. I have no idea. She writes 60 Minutes, you know big 60 Minutes, CBS. You know they have to be licensed by the federal government. They should take their license away. What they did? CBS—And they're all bad. How about David Muir? How bad is he? [booing] How bad is he? I said, ""Crime is going up."" And he said, ""No, it's not. It's going down."" I said, ""It's going up."" He said, ""Crime is going down."" Next question. The next day they released the numbers crime's up 45% in our country. I don't watch him anymore. Pretty boy. Little pretty boy, he is. [laughing]
Think it. She gives this horrible answer. They take every word of it and they throw it away and they insert another answer. That's called election interference. And it's called fraud. And they should have their li—[sic] And you know, all the other guys back there are sticking up for them. You know why? Because they do the same thing, probably. They don't do it for me. You know what they do with me? They make my answer worse. They write—No, they take out, like if I give—I do the weave, you know the weave? I'll tell the story and I'll go from here being—It's actually genius, I have to say, fair and smart. People say it's total genius, but they say, ""Oh, he wandered."" I didn't wander. Wander is when you don't get back to the same point. Now, I give the weave. They don't do anything for me.
What they do with me is I give a beautiful paragraph and they'll take some of the primary sentences out. And that's terrible to do, but that you can sort of get away with. You know, I can even understand it. They want to make it a little shorter. They want a little more time. They don't pay anything for their license. They have a license that's worth billions of dollars. They don't pay anything. Neither does NBC fake news. And ABC fake news is really one of the worst. I will tell you, ABC. But this is CBS. They don't pay for—They use our airwaves. They don't pay anything. And then you hear that 60 Minutes, which is a news show. It's under their news division. So they're not allowed—This isn't an entertainment show. But they took the sentence—not the sentence. They took a whole paragraph, big paragraph, just word after word when that was like the 32 that I listened to.
You know—you know, 32 with a teleprompter where she basically choked and froze like a dog. But that was like the 32. They took it out and they inserted a new answer that was more rational, wasn't great, but it was at least you don't say, ""What's wrong with this person?"" Where did you ever hear them doing that? That's called election—This is an election. We're in the middle of an election. She gave a horrible answer on a new show that pays nothing for the airwaves that are worth billions of dollars. And the other networks stick up because they don't want it to happen to them either. They don't want to see a bidding contest for who's going to do the news, but there has to be some kind of justice in this country. You can't take her answer out, insert a new answer and say, ""This is called major election interference fraud."" [cheers and applause]
So we'll see what happens. I actually think it's the biggest scandal in broadcast history. I really believe that. I think it's the biggest scandal. Nobody's seen anything like it. And people are furious about it, and they all come out with some answer. Well, we did this because of that. They took the answer out. They put a new answer in. There's nothing. There's no justification. So we're probably going to take him to court. Should I take him to court? [cheers and applause] Okay, so we've asked them. We sent them a letter yesterday. We've asked for the entire transcript and we want to see, did they do it in other places too? And we'll see what happens but good. So I have your permission, right? [cheers and applause]
Who would think of these things? I mean, who would think? And it was a mistake. They made a mistake. That's how everybody found that they made a mistake. They put out the original answer. Somehow somebody saw the original answer, said that's not the answer she gave. And when they went back, they feel it was—They found out it was a fraud. It was a fraud on the American public, and they should pay a big price for it.
And if they do pay a big price, it won't happen anymore. She's an international joke and she's going to end up getting us into World War III and Kamala is in free fall. You know, she's in free fall with Arab and Muslim voters. Now in Michigan, did you notice that my poll numbers are very good with the Arab voters? Did you see that? My poll numbers are very good. I appreciate it. You know why? You know why? Because I want peace in the Middle East. I want peace. I did the Abraham Accords. I want peace in the Middle East. [cheers and applause]
So it's very simple. I want to see peace in the Middle East. But my poll numbers in Michigan are very good with the—I was supposed to be zero. She was supposed to be 100. Now I'm beating her because they see how bad she is. But they don't like or respect her. She's sent their overseas—I mean, you take a look. She's sent their jobs overseas. She's brought in crime to the cities. She's taken in all of this tremendous fire. She's okay with it. That took place in the Middle East. But you ask yourself, why would Muslims support lying Kamala Harris when she embraces Muslim hating and very dumb person Liz Cheney? A dumb person who by the way, lost for Congress in the biggest margin in the history of politics. She lost by almost 40 points. [cheers and applause]
The reason she has that honor is that most people, most people wouldn't have stayed in. A congressperson that's in that position normally retires before the election, which would've been a good idea for her to do. But Liz Cheney is a total loser. But her father brought years of war and death to the Middle East. He killed many, many Arabs and Muslims. And now lying Kamala has embraced Liz Cheney. She embraced her. And why would a Muslim or why would an Arab want to vote for somebody that has Liz Cheney as her hero? Liz Cheney is a failed—totally failed politician. Again, she set the worst record. I think it's a terrible mistake that she's made. I think it's a great insult to Muslims all over the world. And I think that she's going to do very bad in Michigan. I really do. I think she's going to do very badly. To do that was a bad thing. And I was very surprised to see it.
But in one way, I was happy because you have to understand, I'm competing against her. I'm competing against this stupid person. I think we are winning by a lot. I have a feeling we're winning by a lot. [cheers and applause]
But this person cannot be president. By the way, is there any place better to be than a Trump rally? [cheers and applause] And don't get used to this because it's only going to go on for another two weeks. It's really something. It's only going to go on to—In four years, you'll be having rallies of 100 people, 200 people. Mr. Wall will be doing other things. Front Row Joes are going to be doing—how these guys are boring as hell. We got two more weeks together with our big—We had 101,000 people in Butler. Think of that. We had 107,000 people in New Jersey. We're making a move for New Jersey too. [cheers and applause]
And two weeks ago in California, we had 109,000 people. So don't get too used to this. What are you going to do Mr. Wall when you come to a rally and there's like 150 people, what are you going to do?
""MR. WALL"": [inaudible] In four years, we'll be back for JD Vance. [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Oh. You like—Right? That's very good. That's good. Good man. I'll tell you that. When the people of North Carolina were stranded and drowning in Hurricane Helene, Kamala Harris was at a glitzy fundraiser in the city that she destroyed, San Francisco. [booing] She spent the last four years taking your money to provide shelter and benefits to illegal aliens. But when North Carolina needed help, Kamala Harris was nowhere to be found. [booing]
You know, they spent your money. They're going to probably have to call it an emergency meeting, a special session of Congress, because the illegal migrants, many of them killers, many of them drug dealers, many of them released from prison, have taken the money that they were supposed to spend in North Carolina and Georgia and Alabama and Tennessee and Florida and South Carolina.
The money was supposed to be spent in those states. And they don't have the money now. They don't have the money because they've spent hundreds—Think of it, hundreds of millions of dollars they've spent flying migrants into states all over the country and letting them go through your porous wall. Kamala Harris does not have the compassion, the smarts, or the strength to be president of the United States. She can't do the job. She's not mentally or physically able to do the job. And on top of all of it, she says she would not do anything differently. She would not do anything differently, she said. Then crooked Joe Biden, which is disqualifying. When you see this tape, you're going to say she's disqualified. He's the worst president. 85% wrong direction. What would you do differently? ""Well, I can't think of anything now."" Let's take a look.
[start of video montage]
INTERVIEWER: Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?
KAMALA HARRIS: There has not a thing that comes to mind.
NARRATOR: We stood there on the tarmac watching you check your watch.
NARRATOR: The chaotic and deadly US evacuation from Afghanistan, stunned Americans at the world and cost the lives of 13 US soldiers.
INTERVIEWER: Would you have done something differently?
HARRIS: There is not a thing that comes to mind.
NARRATOR: More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder and been caught at the board, and then released into the United States.
NARRATOR: An Afghan National is in custody today after being accused of plotting an election-day terrorist attack. The suspect entered the US on a special immigrant visa.
NARRATOR: Gut-wrenching new details in the murder of Georgia. Nursing student Laken Riley. The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuelan national who crossed the unsecured southern border back in 2022.
NARRATOR: Two investigators say are in the country illegally from Venezuela on charges of capital murder and the death of Jocelyn Nungaray.
NARRATOR: A fifth illegal immigrant accused of attacking two New York City police officers over the weekend showed no remorse or regret.
INTERVIEWER: Would you have done something differently?
HARRIS: There is not a thing that comes to mind.
NARRATOR: Only 18% said the economy is in excellent or good condition.
NARRATOR: US inflation has hit a new 40-year high, increasing by 9.1% over the financial year.
NARRATOR: The cost of homes have spiked. Home buyers need to earn 80% more than they did in 2020 to afford a house.
INTERVIEWER: Were you the last person in the room?
HARRIS [?]: Yes.
[end of video]
TRUMP: So North Carolina, if you want to end this disaster, you must go out. Just go out and vote. We got to win this. We got to get this thing. We're pleased to be joined tonight by some really great people, and one of them I'm very proud of. He's done a great job as your senator, Ted Budd. [cheers and applause] Where is Ted? Ted. Thank you, Ted. You're doing a great job. He's doing a great job. Proud of you. Ted, really good. Congresswoman Virginia Foxx, a warrior. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Virginia. Thank you. Congressman Dan Bishop. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Dan. Thank you, Dan. A man who's been really fantastic. All I know is they had more people show up in the last four days than in 2016 or 2020. And many of these people lost their homes. They lost everything. And we had more people. We set a record. Can you believe that? That shows enthusiasm. [cheers and applause]
That shows—North Carolina GOP Chair, Jason Simmons. Thank you, Jason. Great job. How are we doing, Jason? We're going to win the state big, I hope, three times in a row, right? Jason's great. A great friend of mine, and really a friend of my boy, Don, Addison McDowell. He's going to do a fantastic job. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Addison. Oh, you're looking better and better. Look at you. Looks like a real congressman. He is going to be fantastic. Somebody that I've got a lot of respect for, I have for a long time. From the day I met him, I respect him. He was a very successful businessman. He was a great senator. He is a very special guy. David Perdue. David? [cheers and applause] Thank you, David. Thanks.
One of the biggest and best developers around, a man who's made a lot of money and he's very generous, including with North Carolina. He writes a check for everything. He's just a great person, a very generous man. Steve Witkoff. [cheers and applause] Steve, thank you for the help. Thank you. And Peter Navarro, I hope you heard from him. [cheers and applause] This guy is great. They say threat to democracy. They're a threat to democracy. Nobody would've done what they did to him. Nobody would've done what they did to Peter Navarro. He fought for our country so hard. I was witness to it for four years. That guy fought harder than anybody I know. And then they did what they did to him. They're a bunch of bad people. [booing]
They weaponized the Justice Department. They weaponized the FBI. And I've had more investigations than any human being, including Alphonse Capone, the meanest, the Scarface. I've been investigated more than Alphonse Capone. They even raided my house, little place on the beach called Mar-a-Lago. No, but think of it. They raided my house. Can you believe—this is the scum that we have to deal with? This is the scum. What they did to him and other of our friends and friends of the people in this room. It's a disgrace. And Peter, you're going to go down as a hero. You watch. You watch. [cheers and applause] Thank you. And we also have former Democrat Congresswoman and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, a woman that everybody loves. I watched her years ago where she just had so much common sense. We're the party of common sense. I like to say it because it's true. We don't want men playing in women's sports. We want to have borders. We want to have fair elections. Little things like that. Common sense, right? But she's here tonight, and I'm going to just ask her to come up and say a couple of words. Tulsi Gabbard. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: TULSI! TULSI! TULSI
TULSI GABBARD: Thank you very much. Aloha.
CROWD: ALOHA!
GABBARD: You know, I was a Democrat for over 20 years. Today's Democrat—Thank you. Today's Democrat party is completely unrecognizable, which points to the clear choice that we have in this election today. When you look at the party of Kamala Harris, for example, she is anti-freedom, she is pro-censorship, she is pro-open borders, and she is pro-war, without even pretending to care about peace. As President Trump talked about, she has shamelessly embraced the endorsement and support of warmongers like Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney, and others who care more about power and feeding the military industrial complex than they care about you, the American people, and peace.
President Trump has pledged to end wars, not start them. [cheers and applause] And this is why in the eyes of the Kamala Harris Dick Cheney Democrat party, they will do everything possible to try to destroy him. You'll see how they have weaponized the federal government. They have weaponized law enforcement, the Department of Justice. They have done everything possible to try to silence him, to try to remove him from the ballot so we the people don't even have the choice to who we want to vote for. Why have they done this? Because this man has the courage to take them on and root out the deep rot of corruption in the swamp in Washington. [cheers and applause] Now, voters have made their voices heard loud and clear, not once, not twice, but three times in the last three presidential elections, nominating this man to be the Republican nominee for president because of his commitment to these fundamental American principles of freedom and peace and prosperity. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
GABBARD: USA.
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
GABBARD: Now, to those of you here, or those watching at home, who are independent-minded people like myself who love our country and are committed to the constitution and to freedom, the Democrat party has no home for people like us. But we do have a home in the Republican Party where we are welcomed with open arms by President Trump and so many of you who love our country. [cheers and applause] And it is because of my love for our country, and specifically because of the leadership that President Trump has brought to transform the Republican Party and bring it back to the party of the people and the party of peace, that I'm proud to stand here with you today, President Trump, and announce that I'm joining the Republican Party. [cheers and applause]
I am joining the party of the people, the party of equality, the party that was founded to fight against and end slavery in this country. It is the party of common sense and the party that is led by a president who has the courage and strength to fight for peace. [cheers and applause] So as we stand here today, we have 14 days until the most historic election of our lives. And my message to my fellow Americans, regardless of your political affiliation, now is the time for us to stand together to save our country. [cheers and applause] There is nothing less than that. That's on the line.
A vote for President Trump is a vote for a big open tent party that welcomes people from all backgrounds in all walks of life. [cheers and applause] A vote for President Trump is a vote to express our deep love for our country and our appreciation for our God-given rights and freedoms enshrined in the Constitution. [cheers and applause] A vote for President Trump is a vote for secure borders and safe communities. And a vote for President Trump is a vote for peace here in America and around the world. [cheers and applause] I am looking forward to casting my vote for President Trump because you are our best and only hope in this election to lead our country toward a future where every one of us can live in a truly free, peaceful, and prosperous nation. [cheers and applause] Every single vote will count. This is our opportunity to vote for freedom, to vote for peace, to vote for America, and vote for President Trump to go back to the White House and make America great again. Thank you so much. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: TULSI! TULSI! TULSI!
TRUMP: Wow, I didn't know that. I didn't know that. Thank you very much. Tulsi, that's great. Wow. That was a surprise. That was really—She's been independent for a long time. That's a great thing, a great honor. Thank you very much, Tulsi. [cheers and applause] And what a beautiful speech she made, right? Wasn't that beautiful? I'd like to also honor somebody who really has gone through a lot, and I hope he's going to really be helping us a lot. He's got some tremendous ideas for making us healthy and well, and that's RFK Jr. [cheers and applause] He's a very special guy and I just want to thank him because he came in at the same time as Tulsi, and he's got some incredible thing on your health, on women's health, and all of the different elements. I may have to fight him a little bit on the environment, because we have to run this country so well, but that's okay. But he's really an outstanding guy and it was not an easy decision for him, certainly. But RFK Jr. thank you very much. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.
So here are the facts on Kamala, just in wrapping it up. Oh, you thought he was here? No he wasn't. I just wondered. No. In spirit, I can guarantee you he's here. I'll bring him to the next one, but you won't be here. No, he's great. He's got some really incredible ideas and he's so committed, it's incredible, so thank you very much to Bobby.
But here are the facts on Kamala Harris. She's a radical left Marxist, rated even worse than crazy Bernie Sanders or Pocahontas. She destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of Defund the Police movement, and anybody who wants to defund the police, even for a day or a week, is not worthy of being President of the United States. Can't be. [cheers and applause] Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE. ICE, these are great, powerful people, strong people, because that's their job. They have to get some of the worst gang members and drug dealers and everything else out of our country. I know a lot of great tough people right here, but they don't want that job. But she wants to get rid of them. She wants to take them out. We're not taking them out. We're going to make them bigger and stronger because we have a lot of work to do in cleaning up our country and making our country safe.
She vowed repeatedly to ban fracking as California Attorney General. You know this. As California Attorney General, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon, and rape of an unconscious person as a totally nonviolent crime. Think of that. And she pledged—She's so far left. She pledged to confiscate your guns and endorsed a total ban on handgun ownership. [booing] You know that—you know that as soon as that comes up, she will guaranteed confiscate your guns. And she even called for free sex changes for illegal aliens in detention, all at taxpayer expense. And as you know, we had a little trip to McDonald's a couple of days ago—[cheers and applause] and she lied about working at McDonald's. It was a part of her story. ""I worked over the French fries,"" so I decided to see what it was like.
And those French fries were good. They were right out of whatever the hell they may come out of. No, but think of it. And the press refuses to acknowledge it. They refuse to cover it. They have tried. McDonald's denies it. And she never worked there. She never worked there. Some people went and really did spend a lot of time on it. No, she lied and she's a liar. And on top of all of this, Kamala turned our military as woke as it can be, which is not woke because they are great. What they did for me with ISIS was—These are not woke people. But take a look.

[cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Thank you. You got to remember, we won two world wars. We won a lot of things. Well, most recently we did defeat ISIS and they said that couldn't be done. It was going to take five years. It took four weeks. We have a great military and they're not woke. Some of the stupid people up top are woke, but they're not woke. You couldn't make them woke if you tried. You couldn't make them. You could put them in what's called a woke cage for two years and they'd come out fighting, believe me. So in conclusion, with your vote this November, we are going to fire Kamala Harris and we are going to save America. [cheers and applause] With your support, we will cut your taxes and inflation slash your prices, raise your wages and bring thousands of factories back to America and back to North Carolina. They're coming back. [cheers and applause]
We will build American, we will buy American, and we will hire American again. I will end the war in Ukraine very quickly. I will stop the chaos in the Middle East and I will prevent World War III from happening. We're so close. The biggest risk is this number of months before January 20th. We will crush the violent crime that's plaguing our cities and give our police the support, protection, resources and respect they so dearly deserve. They will stop the crime. [cheers and applause] We will strengthen and modernize our military. We rebuilt the entire military, and then a lot of our military was given to Afghanistan. Isn't that nice? Think of that. How about that? That was the most embarrassing moment in the history. 13 dead soldiers, many, many horrifically wounded with arms and legs obliterated. They gave billions of dollars of equipment. They didn't take Bagram, the air base. They should have kept Bagram. It's an hour away from where China makes its nuclear missiles. Isn't that nice? They didn't take it.
And we left people behind. We left Americans behind. They moved the military out first. A child. You know, I had one of the rallies and I had his little five or six-year-old boy in the front row. And I called him up to the stage. His mother was horrified. I understand that. But he was up here, little kid. And I said—I gave him the facts in about two minutes. I said, ""Would you move the military out first or last?"" ""I'd move the military out last, sir."" These stupid people moved the military out first. And you know, I didn't lose one soldier in 18 months. [cheers and applause] I had a talk with Abdul, who was the head of the Taliban. Abdul. Still there. He's still the head. And we had a talk because they were killing a lot of our soldiers with sniper fire and other things, and a lot of them with Obama and Biden, but basically Obama. I don't think Biden knew where the hell he was then either. So they were killing our soldiers. And I told them, I don't have to get into the conversation, for 18 months we didn't lose one soldier.
Then we had a tragic election. Tragic. Think of our country. We wouldn't have had inflation. Least importantly, we wouldn't have had inflation, but we wouldn't have had Russia going into Ukraine. Zero chance. Zero. Wouldn't have ever happened. And it didn't happen for four years. Even the Democrats, most of them agreed, the honest ones, which there aren't too many of them. But even they say wouldn't have happened. And October 7th with Israel would've never happened. They wouldn't have killed all those people. Those people were killed. And the hostages, now they're waiting for the hostages. There won't be many hostages. They're not going to be a lot of hostages. Those people are probably long gone. I've been saying that for a long time. That's part of the problem. The other side doesn't know what to do because they don't have the hostages. It's a very sad situation. That would've never happened. All these things would've never happened.
Think of the difference in the world. Viktor Orban, the head of Hungary, Prime Minister of Hungary, very powerful guy. He said—They asked him, they said to him, ""What's going on in the world? It's blowing up in the Middle East. It's blowing up with Russia, Ukraine. What's going on? You didn't have any of this stuff when Trump was here. What is going on?"" He said, ""The problem is you don't have Trump. You put Trump back, it's all going to be better. They would've never done this with Trump as president."" It's interesting. [cheers and applause] Right? Peter knows. Right, Peter? We will build a missile defense shield all around our country. [cheers and applause]We're going to be safe. We're going to be made in the USA. It's going to be made in North Carolina, partially. We'll land an American astronaut on Mars and we'll call Elon. Let's get going. We want to do that, but we really want to.
And as part of that, we were in big trouble in space. China was lapping us, and Russia was lapping us. And I created Space Force. And now we're lapping the whole world with Space Force. They've done a great job. [applause] Part of that whole thing is about military and military protection. It's going to be a very important. It's going to be one of the really best decisions we ever made, doing Space Force. We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington, D.C., making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. We will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. [cheers and applause]
And we're going to go to Congress and ask very strongly, because that little riot that they had three months ago, they were burning American flags all over the place. We're going to ask Congress to—They say it's unconstitutional. I disagree. To give a one-year prison sentence for anybody burning the American flag. [cheers and applause] Early on. That's right. That's very nice. Very good. You came prepared. Look at you. We will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools. [cheers and applause] And we will keep men out of women's sports. [cheers and applause] I will defend religious liberty, I will restore free speech, and I will defend the right to keep and bear arms, our Second Amendment. [cheers and applause] After years of building up foreign nations, defending foreign borders and protecting foreign lands, we are finally going to build up our country and defend our borders and protect our citizens. [cheers and applause] And we will stop illegal immigration once and for all and it will be stopped. And again, we're going to let people into our country, but they're going to come into our country legally. [cheers and applause] We will not be invaded. We will not be occupied. We will not be conquered. We will be a free and proud nation once again. Everyone will prosper. Every family will thrive and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left lunatic agenda. And we have to have a landslide of an election that's too big to rig. [cheers and applause] You have to get out. You got to get out. Early. Voting is underway. So get everyone, get your friends, get your family. Get Alice to get her husband who just will not get off that couch.
""Come on, Jack. Let's go. Jack, you got to do it, Jack. You can do it. Turn off the television just for an hour. We'll be right back. Jack. Turn off that football game. It doesn't really mean anything, Jack."" Especially with the new kickoff return. Did you ever see anything so stupid in your life? [laughing] They have to ruin things at work. Is that the most ridiculous thing you've ever seen?
After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of our country. With your help now until election day, we will redeem America's promise. We will put America first and we will take back the nation that we love. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And we will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. And we will never, ever, ever, ever surrender. [cheers and applause] Together, we will fight, fight, fight and win, win, win. [cheers and applause] November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country. And together, we will make America powerful again, make America wealthy again, make America healthy again. Come on, Bobby. Bobby's going to do it. Bobby. Let's go, Bobby. You're going to make us healthy, Bobby. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. [cheers and applause] Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. God bless you. God bless you.

    Interview on ""The Joe Rogan Experience""
  


  

  
    October 25, 2024  

  
    ROGAN: All right, we're rolling.
TRUMP: Let's go.
ROGAN: Good to see you. Here we go. One of the things I wanted to talk to you about, I wanted to play this, but we decided we shouldn't play it because it could get copyright strike and we don't want to get the episode—We don't want anybody to have any sort of way to get it down.
TRUMP: Sure.
ROGAN: But it was the episode of you when you were on The Vies, and I think it was 2015 or 2016, like when you were running for President and you got introduced as, ""Our friend, Donald Trump.""
TRUMP: That's right.
ROGAN: Whoopi Goldberg gives you a big hug and a kiss. Joy Behar gives you a big hug. Barbara Walters gives you a big hug. They all loved you. They were all talking about how your—you might be conservative in your financial positions, but you're very liberal socially. They were talking about you in such a favorable light. The audience was cheering and then you actually started winning in the polls and then the machine started working towards you.
TRUMP: Yeah.
ROGAN: But it's, there's probably no one in history that I've ever seen that's been attacked the way you've been attacked and the way they've done it so coordinated and systematically and when you see those same people in the past very favorable to you, like Oprah when you were on Oprah's Show.
TRUMP: Very.
ROGAN: She was encouraging you to be President.
TRUMP: Last week, I did one of her last shows. I think maybe Thursday or Friday. That was a big deal being on Oprah's Show, the last one. And I was like one of the last shows in that final week and I said, ""Boy, we've come a long since that.""
ROGAN: What was it like?
TRUMP: Well, the concept, it was really like two different lives. I had a very wonderful life, but I wanted to do this. The Apprentice was still going very strong. We had 12 seasons and we had actually 14 seasons, 12 years over—They had a couple of them—
ROGAN: Well, they canceled the Apprentice when you were running for President, correct?
TRUMP: No, they had Arnold Schwarzenegger do it. I was involved in that and I had enough of it and we did great. It was doing great, but they wanted me to stay. They all came to see me. They said, ""We're gonna give you a contract."" They wanted to extend my contract. Mark Burnett is a great guy. Then they wanted to extend the contract. Mark said, ""You're crazy. Don't run, don't run. Nobody gives up prime time,"" they said. It's one of those little things, which is probably true for the most—
ROGAN: Nobody gives up prime time though for being President?
TRUMP: Well, for running against 20 some odd people. You know, turned out to be 18 professional people, mostly politicians. They said, ""Who would do this? I mean, it's a long shot."" Actually the heads of NBC came over, Paul Telegdy, all top people came over to see me, try and talk me out of it 'cause they wanted to have me extend. The Apprentice was doing well, so it was 14 seasons, it was 12 years. We had one, two seasons where we had a double, which rarely happens. It was just a hot show, and I said, ""I want to do this."" What happened is previously, like three years, four years before that they did a poll. They had Mitt Romney and somehow they put me in a poll and I blew everybody away. I blew him away, which isn't that hard frankly. But I blew everybody away and I said, ""That's interesting, 'cause I never really gave it that much real thought.""
I thought about it, but never real thought. But I saw these polls were very good and so I was thinking about doing it then, but I had a contract with The Apprentice, plus I was building two big buildings at the time and I wanted to make sure they got finished up properly and it was one of those things. The kids were just sort of getting involved. They're very capable kids, but they were getting involved early on. So I did that. I got them done. I had some very good successes and I came on and then I thought about it for the next one after the Romney disaster and I ran, and I won against Hillary and it was quite an experience, but it was a different life because you're right, The Vies, I was on The Vies many, many times and they loved me.
ROGAN: Just the way people would talk. I mean, even if people had criticisms about you, people that didn't like you, there was always feuds and stuff like that, but the reality was the thing turned on you when they found out that you were gonna be President. It was very coordinated and some people are catching on to that now. There's a lot of people that were longtime Democrats like Elon and Bill Ackman and all these different very intelligent people.
TRUMP: And they support me now. Bill Ackman—
ROGAN: And they support you now.
TRUMP:—supports me.
ROGAN: Yes.
TRUMP: He's been very supportive too.
ROGAN: This is what I wanted to ask you. What was it like when you actually got in? 'Cause nobody really can prepare you for that when you're running for President, you don't really know what it's gonna be like when you actually get into office. What was, what did you think it was gonna be like?
TRUMP: Do you mean in office or when I decided to run?
ROGAN: No, when you got in.
TRUMP: Oh, when I was.
ROGAN: When you got in.
TRUMP: So when I was in and won and was in The White House essentially.
ROGAN: Yes.
TRUMP: Well, first of all it was very surreal. It's very interesting. When I got shot, it wasn't surreal. That should have been surreal. When I was laying on the ground, I knew exactly what was going on. I knew exactly where I was hit. They were saying you were hit all over the place because there was so much blood from the ear. You would know that better than anyone. When they get the ear torn up, it's a—
ROGAN: Ears bleed a lot, yeah.
TRUMP: Anyway. So, and I was thinking the other day—when that happened, I really knew where I was. I knew exactly what happened. I said, I wasn't hit anywhere else. With the presidency, it was a very surreal experience, okay.
ROGAN: What's day one like? You win, you get inaugurated. ""Holy shit, I'm the President.""
TRUMP: Yeah, that's what happened. So I'm driving down Pennsylvania Avenue. I had just built a building on Pennsyl—you know, the hotel, the old post office it was. We called it Trump National Hotel and we sold it to the Waldorf Astoria, and it was a wonderful thing. But I'm driving down, I'm passing the hotel. You've never seen so many motorcycles, police, military, you know, it was a major thing. I got off, really the first time I used Air Force One, landed and we're coming down and it was very beauti—I mean, it was incredible. And we're going down Pennsylvania Avenue in the opposite direction. Normally you're used to going one way and all of a sudden you're going the other way. The street was loaded up and I wanted to go out and I wanted to wave to everybody, but that wasn't smart. You know, the kids, little bit dangerous when you watch like Kennedy and some others, but I really felt, I don't know, the love was so crazy.
And so I did get out of the car for a brief, you know, just for a very short walk. I thought it was very important to do. And Melania got out with a beautiful dress on that became sort of a staple. It was, uh, people loved it and Barron and we're walking down the street. But where it really got amazing, we get to The White House and now it's a little bit before dark, beautiful. And we went up to the President's quarters, they call them the Presidential quarters and I'm standing in this beautiful hallway. It's funny. Nobody ever talks about The White House as being beautiful inside. You think it's all, everything's gonna all metal doors and stuff. It's not. It's so beautiful. I made my money largely on luxury. The hallway is like 25 feet wide. The ceiling heights are, everythin—It's so beautiful. But I was standing there and I said to the guys, ""I want to see the Lincoln bedroom.""
I had never seen the Lincoln bedroom. I'd heard about the Lincoln bedroom. And I was standing with my wife. I said, ""Do you believe it? This is the Lincoln bedroom."" I mean, it was, like, it was amazing because it's, look, if you love the country, but here you are, the Lincoln bedroom. And the bed, you know he was very tall. He was six foot six, which then would be like, like Barron. Would be like Barron Trump. He's 6'9, but six foot six, he was very tall. Then on top of that, he wore—
ROGAN: There it is.
TRUMP:—that. Yeah, there it is. It's a long bed, elongated bed. And because people were shorter then. You see, some of the chairs are very, very low to the ground actually. But he had the long bed and they had, uh you had the Gettysburg Address right on that, right under that. You can't see it here, but right there, the original version of the Gettysburg Address, and this is the original, and I'm looking and I just looked around. I said, ""Do you believe this?"" Because I was never a pol—First of all, even if you were a politician. But I was never a politician. I sort of just started, right.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: And all of a sudden I'm standing in The White House. And it was uh, very very surreal. That room was so beautiful to me, much more beautiful than it actually is. You know, to me, when I looked at the bed, and the bed, you could see it was a little bit longer, had to be a little bit longer. Uh, he lost his son and the two of them suffered from melancholia. They didn't call it depression, they called it melancholia and they suffered from it. He was a very depressed guy and she was a very depressed woman, more so than him. And on top of that, they lost their son whose name was Tad. Tad. And uh, and just seeing it, and the little picture. There's a little tiny picture.
I mean, you can't see the details there, little, tiny—everything the way it was—a little tiny picture of Tad who he lost, and it was devastating. And he was in a war and he was having a hard time because he couldn't beat Robert E. Lee. Robert E. Lee won like 13 battles in a row. And he was getting a phobia, like a fighter. You know a lot about the fight stuff, but like I went to a UFC fight and it was a champion who was 14 and 1 about a year ago, you would know the names, 14 and 1, and the only guy he lost to was this one guy. But the guy that he was fighting was like, almost just an average fighter. He lost numerous times, but he beat this one guy. So I said, ""Okay-""
ROGAN: I really don't know who you're talking about. I'm trying to—
TRUMP: I will figure it out.
ROGAN: Okay.
TRUMP: But about a year ago—But the point is that he lost. He wasn't nearly the fighter as the one—But the one who was not nearly the fighter had beaten, he's the only guy that beat the champ like five years before. And then he said, ""I'll take the guy that won the other fight."" And that's what happened. He beat him a second time.
ROGAN: Sometimes psychological advantages.
TRUMP: Yeah. What is this crazy thing? Lincoln had a—uh, I don't know, I've never read this. I heard it from people in The White House who really understand what was going on with the whole life of The White House. But Lincoln had the yips, about, in a way, as the golfers would say. He had a phobia about Robert E. Lee. He said, ""I can't beat Robert,"" because Robert E. Lee won many battles in a row. He was just beating the hell out of—They tried to get Robert E. Lee to be on the North, but he said, ""No, I have to be with my state.""
The state was his whole thing and he went to the South. And, he was, uh I've had generals tell me—We have some great generals. The real generals, not the ones you see on television. The ones that beat Isis, with me. We defeated Isis in record time. It was supposed to take years and we did it in a matter of weeks. These are great generals. These are tough guys. These are not woke guys. But their favorite general in terms of genius was Robert E. Lee. He took a war—
ROGAN: In terms of strategy, you mean?
TRUMP: Strategically. He took a war that should have been over in a few days and it was, you know, years of hell, a vicious war. And so here I am standing there, and again, I had never really done this before. I ran, I ran a number of months before I won. I probably, uh, I guess if you figured, max it out, it would be a year, something like that. So I had never run for office. And I did well. I mean I, I went into debates. We had 18 people including me, and then slowly but surely they started to disappear. We had debates, good debates.
ROGAN: Everyone's aware of all this stuff. But what I want to get to is what was the experience once you got inside?
TRUMP: It was just—
ROGAN: Like, what did you think it was gonna be like in terms of your ability to govern? This is your first experience governing anything. You've never been a governor, you've never been a mayor—
TRUMP: Yeah.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: Private stuff.
ROGAN: Business.
TRUMP: Yeah.
ROGAN: But now all of a sudden you're inside The White House.
TRUMP: The biggest thing was just that first moment of being in this hallowed—It was really a hallowed place to me. It was—
ROGAN: Surreal.
TRUMP:—beyond—To me, that was the experience. It was a surreal experience. And then with time that wears off. With time, it becomes your place where you stay.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: And I was doing a lot of—I had two things that I really focused on, governing the country and survival. Because from the moment I won, before I got to office, all of a sudden—I mean, they came down. I mean, nobody has ever been treated that way. And, and you see that, I mean, you see we're in The Washington Post very early on. They said, ""Well now the impeachment stuff starts."" And it did. I mean it literally started from the beginning. So I had survival and run the nation. I had a combination. Most people don't have the survival, they get in.
ROGAN: What did you expect though, in terms of once you got inside you had to appoint all these people? How many appointments did you have to make with a very short amount of time?
TRUMP: You have actually 10,000 appointments. Now, they're different. You have big ones and then they appoint 100 people and 200 people. But the President really is involved with approximately 10,000 appointments. So you'll appoint a Secretary of State and he, he or she will appoint a lot of people. So it's a lot. But in terms of major ones, you probably have like 100, but they're big ones. Treasury, State, military.
ROGAN: And how did you know who to appoint?
TRUMP: Well, I didn't. I had no experience—
ROGAN: You didn't.
TRUMP: You have to understand, Joe—
ROGAN: Right. So are you going—
TRUMP: I was there 17 times in Washington and I never stayed over. According to the press, which I think is probably right. Over the years I was only there 17 times. I never stayed over. So now I'm sitting there, I'm saying, ""This place is gorgeous, but, you know, I don't know anybody."" It's like you, you go to certain areas and other areas, they may be great. Washington was great. Washington's not so great now, we got to fix it, we're gonna make it better. A very dangerous place, very badly maintained place. We're gonna make it great. We're gonna make it better. We're gonna bring it back. But I wasn't a Washington guy. I was a New York guy. I was a New York builder and I built buildings in New York and I knew that whole world, but I didn't know the Washington world too well. And all of a sudden you're supposed to be appointing top people. So—
ROGAN: What did you think it was gonna be like? Did you have any ideas of what it was gonna be like and what was different?
TRUMP: Well, I was always involved in politics, but usually from the standpoint of a donor.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: I was a donor. I was a big donor. I gave money to politicians. I enjoyed politicians—
ROGAN: Mostly Democrats, right?
TRUMP: Both, really. Pretty much both. I have actually pictures of Ronald Reagan and me when I was very young.
ROGAN: Well, you were a Democrat until what year?
TRUMP: I was a Democrat, um, I could get you the exact, but the early nineties. The early nineties. I switched over eventually. Actually they had a Reform Party. I was thinking about doing that for a little while, but then fortunately I didn't because it's very hard. You know, it's a two-party system. And anytime you hear third party, I know you like RFK Jr. and so do I, he's a fantastic guy.
ROGAN: I do. But—
TRUMP: But that whole thing is very tough.
ROGAN:—I thought that thing, being an independent was nonsense.
TRUMP: It doesn't work because even if you do great, you're not gonna get Congress. In other words, you need now to say, ""Okay, now I'll get half of Congress."" They're never gonna vote for you. So even if you got there, which is very hard, and I know how you feel about Bobby and I feel the same way, and he's now with us. But doesn't w—it's pure and simple. It's a two-party system. And somebody, I won't mention his name, but somebody spent $250 million trying to get the nomination as a Reform Party candidate or whatever, and they got just nowhere. You get eaten, just get eaten. The system eats you alive.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: So, uh, it was really somebody that not only was new to Washington, but was new to politics. So in the office of the presidency, over the years, all those Presidents you've had 92% were politicians and 8% were Generals, General Eisenhower, General Washington, right. General George Washington. You had Generals. So it's 8% Generals, no Admirals. 8% Generals and 92% politicians. You know, they're politicians and they go on. So they never had a business guy or they never had a guy that wasn't elected to an office. They were all, like, Ronald Reagan was really, he was a movie actor, but he became the Governor of California for, I think, two terms, and then he ran. So you'd never had a thing like this. But I uh, in terms of me, and sometimes I'd use it as an excuse, and I don't like having excuses actually, but I'd use it as an excuse. I had to rely on people that I respected or liked, but that I didn't know that well because I didn't know them that well.
Some of those people I campaigned against 'cause when you have 18 people, we had mostly politicians running in the election, you know, running in the primaries, and they got knocked out one by one. But I got to like some of them, some of them I didn't like at all. I don't like them now. And I'd rely on them and I'd rely on other people. So all of a sudden people would come in, I'd like to recommend so-and-so to be Secretary of State, and I'd have three, four people recommend—One thing I can tell you, Joe, everybody wants the position.
ROGAN: Of course.
TRUMP: No, no. But sometimes they'll hear, ""A lot of people don't want to work with Trump because Trump is tough to work with, et cetera."" Let me tell you, everybody wants to be any one of these positions. They'd die for it.
ROGAN: Of course.
TRUMP: Now they don't want to be known. I mean, there's a particular guy in New York, primarily. Very big, very big, very successful, very strong, very political, although he is not a politician. He'd give anything to be Secretary of State. But if they ask him, ""No, I don't think I would do it."" But in the meantime, begging for it. Okay, begging.
ROGAN: I believe you.
TRUMP: Look, everybody wants it.
ROGAN: But what I wanted to get to—
TRUMP: And by the way, no matter what you do—But it's very dangerous to pick somebody outside of a politician because a politician has been basically vetted for years. You pick a business guy and they've never been vetted at all, and they're you know, the head of a big company or something, but they've never been vetted, you know nothing about his personal life, you know nothing about where he's been. When you put him in, it's a little bit dangerous because all of a sudden they get checked up and you hear things that you say, ""Wow, this is not gonna work out too well."" So it's very dangerous. Picking people that are outside of politics is somewhat dangerous.
ROGAN: So you're kind of stuck in a position where you have to pick established people. Then the problem with established people is established people are already indoctrinated into the system.
TRUMP: And they're stiffs in many cases.
ROGAN: Stiffs.
TRUMP: Stiffs. They're survivors. I find that uh, you know—
ROGAN: What do you mean by stiffs? When you say stiffs—
TRUMP: A stiff. They don't have—They have nothing. Or they're smart and survivor—One little thing. So there was a congressman years before I ran, and I was very close to him and I needed a license on something and he was very important in getting the license. But it was a little bit controversial, the license, this particular thing that was being licensed. But I was close to this guy and helped him and everything else, and I went to him. I said, ""I'd like to have you help."" And he said, ""Let me take a look at it."" I said, ""Ooh, that's not too good, but I really hope you're gonna help."" Anyway, he tapped me along for a long period of time and ultimately didn't do it. And I said, ""You are a stiff. You could have done this thing so easy,"" et cetera. But it was controversial. He was in Congress for many years, like 28 years. And, you know, there's a reason when somebody's there for 28 years, you got to be sort of smart.
ROGAN: Right. A survivor.
TRUMP: You have all the scandals. And I realized he was a survivor.
ROGAN: And so they never do anything controversial.
TRUMP: Well, they don't do—
ROGAN: They never take any chances or speak—
TRUMP: Yeah, they don't take—
ROGAN:—their opinion. It's outside of the—
TRUMP: Yeah, yeah.
ROGAN: Yeah.
TRUMP: And yet I don't disrespect him for it. I actually respected the guy more in a certain way. I said—
ROGAN: 'Cause he did survive.
TRUMP:—""You know what, he's been there for 28 years and he made it through."" A lot of people don't make it through. They don't last long.""
ROGAN: It's a good way for non-exceptional people to survive.
TRUMP: Well, it is. It certainly is.
ROGAN: So you're in there, you have 10,000 appointments you have to make. Like, so you're getting advice from people. And, at what point in time—did you have a moment in time where you realized, like uh, these are bad choices, like, ""Some of these people I shouldn't have had in there""?
TRUMP: Oh, yeah. I think—so the one question that you'll ask me, that I think you'll ask me that people seem to ask, and I always come up with the same answer. Ahh, if—the one mistake, 'cause I had a lot of success, great economy, great everything. Everything was great. The military, we rebuilt it. Biggest tax cuts in history, all the stuff we did—We had a great presidency. Three Supreme Court justices. Most people get none. You know, you pick them young, this way they're there for 50 years, right.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: So, even if a President is there for eight years, oftentimes they never have a chance. I had three. It was sort of the luck of the draw, but I will say that it always comes back to the same answer. The biggest mistake I made was I picked some people. I picked some great people, you know, but you don't think about that. I picked some people that I shouldn't have picked. I picked a few people that I shouldn't have picked and—
ROGAN: Neocons?
TRUMP: Neocons or bad people or disloyal people or—
ROGAN: People that were just bad—
TRUMP:—people that were into the—You got the—
ROGAN: You got bad advice?
TRUMP: Yeah, I mean, look, you're reading about them a little bit today, A guy like Kelly who was a bully, a bully but a weak person. You know more about bullies than anybody probably around 'cause you deal in a certain sport where the bullies are exposed very quickly. But, you know, he's bad. Bolton was an idiot, but he was great for me because I'd go in with a guy like a John Bolton. You know John Bolton?
ROGAN: Mm-hmm.
TRUMP: A friend of mine called me up. I was picking Bolton, and he's a very smart guy. His name is Phil Ruffin. He's a very rich guy from Las Vegas. One of the—he's a great card player. He doesn't play cards, but he's a great play—He's just a natural, got poker sense, right. The good old poker sense. And Phil Ruffin is a very, very wise kind of a guy and very, one of the richest people around, and has had great success and understands people, so, it was in that I was picking Bolton or I picked Bolton, he called up, he said, ""Don't pick him."" ""Why?"" ""He's a bad guy."" Now, he wasn't in politics at all. He's in various businesses. He said, ""He's a bad guy. He's just—It always works out bad with that guy.""
I said, ""Oh man, I wish you told me this two weeks ago. I already hired him. He's here."" And, and he was right. But he was good in a certain way. He's a nut job. And every time I had to deal with a country, when they saw this whack job standing behind me, they said, ""Oh man, Trump's gonna go to war with us. He was with Bush when they went stupidly into the Middle East, they shoulda never done it. I used to say it as a civilian. So I always got more publicity than other people. And it wasn't like I was trying. In fact, I don't know exactly why. Maybe you can tell me why.
ROGAN: Oh, I could definitely tell you. You said a lot of wild shit.
TRUMP: Maybe. Maybe I did.
ROGAN: You said a lot of wild shit.
TRUMP: Maybe that's it.
ROGAN: And then CNN in all their brilliance by highlighting your wild shit made you much more popular.
TRUMP: Yeah, yeah.
ROGAN: And they boosted you in the polls 'cause people were tired of someone talking in this bullshit pre-prepared politician lingo. And even if they didn't agree with you, they at least knew, ""Whoever that guy is. That's him. That's really him."" When you see certain people talk, certain people in the public eye, you don't know who they are. You have no idea who they are. It's very difficult to know. You see them in conversations, they have these pre-planned answers. They say everything. It's very rehearsed. You never get to the meat of it.
One of the beautiful things about you is that you freeball, you get out and you do these huge events and you're just talking and you're making—We've highlighted you on the show many times when you did this Biden impression where he's walking around and he doesn't know what he's doing—
TRUMP: It scares—
ROGAN: It's stand up. It's funny stuff, but it's like you—And you were making fun of Elon one time. You were doing an Elon impression. It's great. You have, like, comedic instincts. Like when you said to Hillary, ""You'd be in jail."" That's great timing.
TRUMP: Yeah.
ROGAN: But it's like that kind of stuff was unheard of as a politician. Like, no one had done that. And I think—
TRUMP: It's funny, you need at least the attitude of a comedian when you're doing this business. This is a very dangerous business first of all. It's a very tough business. When—
ROGAN: It's the most dangerous business.
TRUMP: Yeah. It's the most—well, for a job?
ROGAN: Yes. I mean, other than—
TRUMP: This is the far—
ROGAN:—going to war and being a firefighter or being a cop, it's the most dangerous business because—
TRUMP: It's the most dangerous. Being President is the most dangerous—
ROGAN: Especially you. I mean—
TRUMP: I'm much more [inaudible]—
ROGAN: You haven't even got to the election, there's been two assassination attempts. And they've brushed those out of the news like it was nothing.
TRUMP: Yeah, they'd rather not talk about them.
ROGAN: Imagine if there was assassination attempts on Biden, how hard people would be attacking the right. How they would be trying to get guns taken away from people, they would try to ramp up gun laws. They would try to figure out some way to blame you. If there was a tax on—if Biden got shot in the ear, we would've never heard the end of it.
TRUMP: But I think he's in good shape because it's only consequential Presidents. If you take a look at what's happened, look, I'm for having countries pay us billions and billions and trillions even, dollars. I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China. Nobody took in 10 cents. Not one other President. I do things that make it, I mean don't necessarily make me so popular. I just do what's right. And when you do that, you know, you're more—Look at Iran. Iran—we would've never had the attack on Israel at all. Iran was broke. I told China, ""If you buy, you can't do business in the United States under any circum—"" We we're gonna go cold Turkey with China. Some people think that would've been a good idea anyway. But, ""If you buy any oil, one barrel of oil from them, you're not doing business."" I said that to many countries. Iran was broke. They had no money for Hezbollah. They had no money for Hamas. They had no mon—But I make myself—you know, I mean, I understand what I'm doing. You make yourself a target and it's a very dangerous business. But, if you just look at statistically, so I, I sort of think, I don't know if it's right, but one-tenth of 1% for a race car driver, it's a pretty dangerous business, right.
ROGAN: Yeah.
TRUMP: One tenth of 1% for a bull rider. I tell you to me, I—
ROGAN: You talking death?
TRUMP: These guys that ride the bulls is worse than UFC.
ROGAN: Yeah.
TRUMP: These guys. You see these big monster bulls and you see it in slow motion where the foot is like an inch away from the head. If it hits them, the guy's gone. But they die. They die.
ROGAN: So one tenth of 1% die, is that what you're saying?
TRUMP: Yeah, yeah. One tenth of 1% die.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: And they certainly get hurt badly. Really, I mean, they can't walk after a certain period of time. But with a President, if you look at the assassination—
ROGAN: The amount of assassination attempts—
TRUMP:—and attempts too. And attempts. No, it's a very dangerous position. I never thought of that, by the way, when I did it. You know, you don't tend to—I don't think of—
ROGAN: Did you just assume because people loved you on the Apprentice, they were gonna love you as a President?
TRUMP: Well, I think it would be so easy. You know, it was very interesting—
ROGAN: Well, it probably would have been if the media didn't attack you the way they did. If they didn't conflate you with Hitler. I mean, even today, like, Kamala was talking about you and Hitler. You, they're gonna take what you said about Robert E. Lee. ""Oh, Donald Trump wishes the South won.""
TRUMP: ""Oh, he loves Robert E. Lee."" That's right. ""He loves Robert E. Lee.""
ROGAN: They love to take things out of context and distort things.
TRUMP: Well, they don't even have to take them out. They make them up entirely.
ROGAN: They do that too.
TRUMP: But you know, it's interesting when you mentioned—I was very popular and, and all those people love me. I mean, this uh, some of these women, they're, they're so stupid—And Joy, she would, every time she'd see me, I'd be in the theater or something and she goes, ""You have to be on the show again. Come on, come on, let's go. We have to.""
ROGAN: She loved you.
TRUMP: Loved me.
ROGAN: That episode where—
TRUMP: By the way—
ROGAN: People should watch that episode just to see what we're talking about. Like I said, we don't want to get a copyright strike, so we're not gonna put it up, but—
TRUMP: It's okay.
ROGAN:—if you watch the episode, it's bananas. It's like an alternative universe. And it's only—
TRUMP: But Whoopi loved me.
ROGAN:—nine years ago.
TRUMP: Whoopi loved me.
ROGAN: Loved you. Gives you a hug and a kiss.
TRUMP: And how about that other one, the new one on there, the one from my Administration? She writes me a letter, ""You're the greatest President."" She leaves. She worked as an Assistant Press Secretary. I hardly knew her, but she leaves and she writes me this gorgeous letter. What's her name? She was—I don't even know. You know, anyway, she was in the Administration, she's on now currently, sits in the far right-hand side, whatever the hell her name is, and she writes a letter, the most beautiful letter—she's quoted in the paper, ""He's a consequential, he was the greatest President, ba, ba, ba."" Then all of a sudden she goes on The View, she started hitting the hell out of me because they won't hire her unless. I've had many people go on CNN and they called and said, ""I don't know what to do. They want to pay me a lot, but I have to be negative on you."" I said, ""Be negative. That's okay."" There were guys on like CNN, they won't hire them. Sean Duffy is a, you know, congressman and he retired. He got a good job with CNN, but he was only positive about Trump. So they kept him, but they would never put him on. I mean, I respect what he did. He could have gone, you know, negative. I tell people, go negative. Let my friends make the money. It's so crooked. The press is so crooked.
ROGAN: It's crooked, but it's also, they're diminishing themselves.
TRUMP: They're hurting themselves.
ROGAN: They're killing all their credibility and it's opening up their credibility to new media. It's opening up their credibility to independent media. All these—
TRUMP: The worst I've ever seen though, and I've seen the worst. I mean, I've been a part of it. I've been—I've seen the worst. Kamala goes on 60 Minutes, gave an answer that a child wouldn't give. It was so bad. And 60 Minutes took the answer out. They took the whole and they put another answer in—
ROGAN: They edited it deceptively.
TRUMP:—which didn't make sense either, but it was better. They took the—Well, it wasn't editing, it was fraud. This was not editing. Editing is where I'll give an answer and they'll take a couple of words and change it around. Or they might even take a sentence or two off, which is very bad, but, that, it's sort of bad. I'd give an answer, which was a very good answer. I always talk about, you know, I like to give along the weave. I like to—
ROGAN: Yeah, you like to weave things in.
TRUMP: Yeah. But when you do the weaves, and you have to be very smart to do weaves, when you do the weave—look at this. Just in this one thing we're talking about little pieces [inaudible] but it always ends up—
ROGAN: Uh-huh. Got to get it back to home.
TRUMP: No, no. It comes back home for the right people. For the wrong people, it doesn't come back home and they end up in the wilderness, right? But, but they can take my answer. And you know what? They may take a little piece of it out or something and they use the term, yes, we want to save time. Well, it's not it but I've never heard—I think it's the biggest scandal in broadcast history what happened to CNS—CBS. So you have CBS 60 Minutes. That's a news program. It's not an entertainment program. It's under their news. It's the head of their news thing. She gives an answer that was, that shows that she's essentially incompetent and they took the answer. Could you imagine them doing that for me?
ROGAN: We can show it if you want people to see it. Can we show it?
TRUMP: Go ahead, sure.
ROGAN: No. We'll get in trouble. We'll get copyright strike.
ROGAN STAFF [inaudible]
ROGAN: Okay.
TRUMP: I'll indemnify.
ROGAN: Listen, anyone can find it but it's drastic. But what was interesting was the other full version was available initially. It was like a preview.
TRUMP: Somebody made a big mistake.
ROGAN: Somebody put that preview out there and then—
TRUMP: Some kid put the preview out.
ROGAN: Exactly.
TRUMP: And then the bosses did this or that and then all of a sudden said, ""We got a problem.""
ROGAN: Exactly. And then it became—
TRUMP: They got caught by mistake. But don't you think that's a—To me, and don't forget, this is election interference and fraud and it's 60 Minutes. It's their news division. So—
ROGAN: It's a big deal.
TRUMP: They give those licenses out, Joe, for free. They should pay a fortune. They're worth a fortune. They give them out for free because they're using the public airwaves. With cable, you don't have that. Cable's different, but, you know, it's just a different deal. But with the networks, they give those license. They're worth billions of dollars. They give them out free but you have to be honest and all, that was bad.
I think that David Muir and that woman that was aside, I never even heard of her, but they kept interrupting me. It was like I said, ""How many people am I debating here? I got this one and I got you two."" But he went after me 11 different times. You know, it's interesting. I always thought he was a nice guy, but he's just like the rest of them, you know?
ROGAN: Well, that's his job, unfortunately. And I'm sure what they want—
TRUMP: No, but not when they're wrong.
ROGAN: You're right. Well, the problem was they fact-checked you and they didn't fact-check her.
TRUMP: Not at and all.
ROGAN: One of the most egregious examples of that was when she said that there is—there are no troops right now deployed in war zones. There's a very famous viral video that went online of troops in a war zone saying, ""Well, what the fuck are we then?"" Because there's thousands of them. Dan Crenshaw, the congressman posted on his Instagram all of the various examples of—
TRUMP: Too many.
ROGAN:—troops that are deployed, thousands and thousands of troops that are currently deployed.
TRUMP: Stupidly deployed.
ROGAN: But the point is, if this is gonna be an actual real debate and not a propaganda exercise, if it's gonna be a real debate, you have to fact-check everybody. Like, if someone says maybe she thought there was no, which is also a problem. So it's one of two things. It's either it was not true. It was a lie on purpose, which is terrible. Or it was the opposite. It was ignorance, which is also terrible.
TRUMP: Well, Joe, when I said crime is soaring, he said, ""No, no crime has gone down."" I said, ""Where did you hear that one, crime has gone down?"" I mean, I'm debating with this guy, but I've had that.
ROGAN: Well, there was amended FBI statistics that came out after that, that showed that crime had gone up substantially.
TRUMP: And by the way, the statistics were fraud because when they put out the statistics, they didn't include some of the worst places. They didn't include some of the worst cities, some of the most deadly places.
ROGAN: Then there is also a problem—
TRUMP: But when the real numbers came out, I turned out to be right. But I haven't gotten—
ROGAN: You turn out to be right but then there's another problem. Unreported crime is way up because people have lost—Look, the morale that the police department has, in a lot of these cities what they've done is defund the police, bullshit. These, the morale of these poor cops, it's fucking horrible. It's the dumbest idea of all time.
TRUMP: So bad. So bad.
ROGAN: But what they've done is they've, they've made these cops feel terrible, like good cops. I think cops are just like everybody else. Most of them are great. It's like everybody else. But if you run into one carpenter and he does a shitty job in your house, you say ""Carpenters fucking suck."" But they don't suck. Most of them are great.
TRUMP: Police have been—
ROGAN: And that's the key thing with cops. But the point is they, they did all of these things in this very foolish way. And these cops are suffering the consequences of it. And so subsequently, what happens is a lot of crime is unreported. A lot of crime, like you call the cops. They're too busy. They can't even get to you. ""Oh, your house got broken into. Sorry."" You know, it, it doesn't even make a report. There's a lot of people that they just give up.
TRUMP: It's so sad what's happened. And I'll tell you what. I go to police funerals. And we went to one in Long Island. I visited the family in Long Island. A very big deal. It's so dangerous. People don't realize—the car, dark windows, pull over. He's a gentleman. ""Please pull over."" Door opens. Guy comes out firing. Even if they were allowed to pull out their gun, which they're not, they can't pull out the—
ROGAN: Doing time, yeah.
TRUMP: They still wouldn't have time.
ROGAN: It's every cop's first nightmare.
TRUMP: They open a door and he was killed and his partner was hurt. He was killed. And you don't, I mean, you don't even have an eighth of a second to think. And it is such a dangerous job. That in particular, think of it. You go up to a car. You don't know who's sitting there with a gun. And if they have a gun, you really don't have a chance. You're not allowed to have your gun out, by the way. There're very strict rules.
So, number one, they're in it. But even if you could have your gun out, the door opens and a guy and bullets start firing out, and especially where they have the dark windows, darkened windows. It is such a dangerous profession. And it's very hard to get cops now because they're not given any backup. And you're right. You know, they have like an eighth of a second to make a decision that's gonna change their life. If they make the wrong decision, they're gonna end up on the front page of every newspaper in the country and they're gonna lose their house and their pension and their job and their wife is gonna be gone and everything is gonna be gone.
ROGAN: Absolutely. And here's another thing that people don't talk about. How many of them have PTSD? Probably most of them. These guys are seeing people shot all the time. You know, I've talked to a ton of cops about it and a lot of cops commit suicide. A lot of cops are deeply depressed. A lot of cops have seen—
TRUMP: But we have to give them back their dignity. We have to, we can't—we just have to give them back—You said it so good. You never hear anybody say that—You're never gonna have it perfect, you're gonna have a bad apple.
ROGAN: In everything, in every profession.
TRUMP: But every time there's a bad apple, that gets massive publicity and it, it taints everybody also.
ROGAN: But it's also this very irresponsible thing where people say defund the police, get rid of the police. Even Kamala Harris was a part of that, that it's a, it's a very stupid way to look at it. What you should do is fund the police. You should have better training. You should have cops that feel more appreciated. You should have some something that helps mitigate this PTSD that all of them suffer through.
TRUMP: Right. She was uh, a big part of defund the police. That was a big thing for her, defund the police, always defund the police.
ROGAN: Well, it's a political idea.
TRUMP: Yeah. But anybody with that political thought, I don't think should be running for President. And I think people are getting wise to it. you know, We're doing pretty well now. I don't know. Maybe in a week from now, say sorry about that. I was wrong.
But we're leading everything. And I think we're gonna have a very good election. But I tell people—because people are starting to get to know her. But she was defund the police. She was all these trans-gender operations. If you wanted a sex change and you were in detention and you demanded a sex change, they would give you a sex change.
ROGAN: Well, the wildest one is this idea of giving free sex change to illegal immigrants.
TRUMP: That's right, in detention.
ROGAN: That is the wildest thing. Is that the biggest problem you have? You just walked here from Guatemala. You need to become a girl.
TRUMP: That's right. But she was in favor of it.
ROGAN: Yes.
TRUMP: So, so, think of it. Now she changed. She's changed 15 policies. In fact, I'm gonna send her a MAGA cap.
ROGAN: She stole your idea about no tax for tips.
TRUMP: I came up with this idea that honestly, nobody ever heard of. And now it took her two months. But you know what? All of us—
ROGAN: Well, it caught fire.
TRUMP: And she just put it into a little speech.
ROGAN: Yep, it became popular.
TRUMP: Well, I think we still have that issue. I think that issue is a good one for us. And then we have a lot of good issues. you know, We had the other day. Think of how simple some of these things are. We're trying to get cars built in the United States. Detroit has been really tough. It's been a disaster. They have a huge factory, a huge car auto plant being built by China in Mexico. Make cars, sell them in the United States, put everybody out of business. Here we go again.
I said, ""If that plant is there when I'm President, I will put 100 or 200 percent tariffs on every car."" They'll be unsellable in the United States. And they just announced they're not gonna build the plant because they think I'm gonna win. Think of it. They're not gonna build the plant. This was their biggest plant in the world. More than all of Michigan makes. That's how big. you know, This is what we're getting to. And I said, ""If that plan goes up, I want them to understand if I win, I'm gonna tax those cars at the rate of 100 or 200 percent apiece so that you won't be able to sell them in the United States."" They just announced they're not gonna build the plant.
ROGAN: Yeah, I read that.
TRUMP: And they did a big favor for our country by doing that. And I'm not even there yet. To me, the most beautiful word, and I've said this for the last couple of weeks, in the dictionary today, and any, is the word tariff. It's more beautiful than love. It's more beautiful than anything. It's the most beautiful word. This country can become rich with the use, the proper use of tariffs. It will keep—
ROGAN: Did you just float out the idea of getting rid of income taxes and replacing it with tariffs?
TRUMP: Well, okay.
ROGAN: Were you serious about that?
TRUMP: Yeah, sure, why not? Because we—Ready? Our country was the richest in the, relatively, in the 1880s and 1890s. A President who was assassinated named McKinley, he was the tariff king. He spoke beautifully of tariffs. His language was really beautiful. uh, ""We will not allow the enemy to come in and take our jobs and take our factories and take our workers and take our families unless they pay a big price.""
And the big price is tariffs. And he'd speak like that. But he was right. And then around, in the early 1900s, they switched over stupidly to, frankly, an income tax. And you know why? Because countries were putting a lot of pressure on America. ""We don't want to pay tariffs. Please don't."" you know, Believe me. They control our politicians. If you look at the kind of numbers that these guys make, then and now. But we had a commission meeting in the uh, I think it was 1887.
Think of this problem. We were so rich. We had so much money. We didn't know what to do. So they set up a blue ribbon commission on tariffs. And the sole purpose is what to do with all the money we had. We were so rich because we were taxing other people for coming in and taking our jobs. And China does it. That's what China did. If you want to open a factory and sell cars, if you build a factory here or have a factory, they don't take our cars. They wouldn't take our cars. But if you build a plant in China, you can do that. Elon did that. By the way, Elon is great. That guy is such a great guy. I think you're a fan of Elon.
ROGAN: I love him.
TRUMP: He is from a different planet. He's the greatest guy. That rocket coming in. I'm, I'm, I told the story once or twice, so you may have heard it because his speeches have been good. Did you see the one last night?
ROGAN: Yeah.
TRUMP: 29,000 people. That was it. And the one the night before was the same thing. We are, we are rocking and rolling. But Elon, and I'm talking to this very important guy, I said, ""Wait a minute, I'm looking at something."" The television's unmuted, right/
And I see this rocket. It's all brown from the heat, you know, 10,000 degrees pouring down at thousands of miles an hour. And I see this thing. you know, It's like a 20-story building.
ROGAN: And it catches it.
TRUMP: And I say to this guy, he's an important guy, ""Wait a minute. uh, Let me just put you to hold. I got to see this."" And I see this and, and it's gonna crash. I said, ""It's gonna crash into the gantry."" They call it a gantry. I said, ""Oh man, that's gonna be a disaster"" because it's starting to get very close. And then all of a sudden you see the flames in the bottom, rrrrr and then boom. And then you see the two arms grab it.
ROGAN: Crazy.
TRUMP: And I forgot the guy. I had him on the phone. I forgot. No, I said, ""The hell with it."" No, I called Elon. I said, ""Was that you?"" He said, ""That was me."" And I said, ""Who else can do that?"" He said, ""Nobody. Russia can't do it. The United States. Nobody can do it.""
You know, I set up Space Force. That was me. And that's the first time in 82 years that we opened another branch since the Air Force. And that's gonna be one of our most important things. But think of what Elon does. And he did one other thing that I never heard of it. It's uh, Starlink. I went down to North Carolina, Georgia, the different places, right?
I followed it right down. And they had no communication. The poles were all knocked down. Every—and one of the guys in North Carolina said, ""Could you do me a favor? Do you know Elon Musk?"" ""Yes. He endorsed me."" By the way, he gave me the nicest endorsement, to the tough—he said, ""The country is gonna fail and you should do the same thing, Joe, because you cannot be voting for Kamala."" Kamala. You're not a Kamala person. I know you. I've watched you. I know him better than he is. You know what? Without speaking to you, I think I know you maybe almost as well as your wife. I have watched you for so many years. You're not a Kamala person. You're a Khabib person, but you're not a Kamala person. Nobody's gonna know who Khabib is. [Khabib Nurmagomedov, mixed martial arts fighter]
ROGAN: They know who Khabib is.
TRUMP: But he was not bad, right?
ROGAN: Oh, he was phenomenal.
TRUMP: But that's your kind of person.
ROGAN: Your weave is getting wide. We're getting wide with this weave.
TRUMP: No, no. My weave but is it much better?
ROGAN: I want to bring it back to tariffs.
TRUMP: But wait. One second. Before we finish with tariffs. So they said, they said, ""Could you get him? We need Starlink."" And I called Elon. He got it for him so fast, saved so many lives. And I said, ""How was it?"" They said, ""Better than the wires."" You know, they couldn't put them in. They were all gone. So getting back to tariffs.
ROGAN: I've used it recently in Utah in the mountains.
TRUMP: That's great. Did you find it good?
ROGAN: Oh, it's phenomenal. It's the size of an iPad. You just set it down on the ground, you get high speed internet. It's incredible.
TRUMP: We're spending—Just to show you. We're spending a trillion dollars to get cables all over the country, right? Up to upstate areas where you have, like, two farms and they're spending millions of dollars to advocate. Elon can do it for nothing.
ROGAN: Well, talk about the $42 billion that was wasted on this internet access program. That the United States—they didn't get anybody access to internet.
TRUMP: They haven't hooked up one person yet.
ROGAN: Not one person.
TRUMP: That's right.
ROGAN: They spent $42 billion. They could have gotten Starlinks to everybody with that kind of money.
TRUMP: For almost nothing.
ROGAN: Yeah.
TRUMP: For a monthly charge.
ROGAN: And it would have been incredible. And it's high speed internet everywhere you want to go.
TRUMP: And he wanted to do that.
ROGAN: And he wanted to do it.
TRUMP: How about this? They built uh, the charger stations, right? In the Midwist—in the Midwest. They built eight of them. They cost $9 billion. That's like a gas pump, right? They built nine gas pumps, except electricity comes out. They spent $9 billion. Three of them don't work. The whole thing. There's so much waste. I could, I could sit here and tell you about things that, that there's so much waste, abuse, and fraud.
ROGAN: Oh! Yeah. I'm sure. I mean, I think everybody's aware of that now.
TRUMP: Likes get back to tariffs.
ROGAN: When you're talking about—One of the criticisms of your Administration was with tax cuts and with tariffs, you increased the deficit.
TRUMP: Yeah.
ROGAN: So was—what was the strategy behind that? And did you think it was gonna increase the deficit by a substantial amount?
TRUMP: Okay. We were ready to rock. It was all—You know, I had a bad system. We had horrible tax policy. I made it great. With a much lower tax rate. So I took it from almost 40% down to 21%. Now I'm bringing it from 21% down to 15%. But only if you make your product in the United States, which is great. People call me. They said, ""What a great idea."" Nobody ever heard of that before. I don't care if they make the product in Japan. Why should I give up? So it's a 21.
That—at 21, in the first year, we took in much more revenue than we did at almost 40. Think of that. It inspired—Now we had other things, too. We were able to get people to bring back their money. You couldn't—you couldn't bring back your money. If you had money in Europe, like Apple, Apple had many billions of dollars outside. They couldn't bring it. There was no way to bring it back in. uh, The bureaucracy, the documents, the whole thing. And also the tax was too high. They wanted like half of it or something.
Nobody's gonna do that. So they leave their money in Japan and they spend their money there. That was part of what I did. The money came pouring back in. Apple took in hundreds of billions of dollars. They brought it back from overseas. They brought it in.
ROGAN: So how does the deficit increase because of that?
TRUMP: So what happened is this. We were ready to rock and roll. And then we had the COVID thing and we had to focus on that. And if we didn't give some businesses a hand, they would have all—you would have had a depression like in 1929. But we were ready to start. We were going to—we would have very shortly been paying off debt.
You know, we have $35 trillion in debt. And I'll never forget it. We were—it was talking about from, you know, the standpoint of being in office. I'm in the Oval Office and I have John McLaughlin and Fabrizio, the two very good pollsters probably. I don't know. I would say the two best. Who knows? But very good pollsters. And we're starting to think about running for a second term. And we had the greatest economy in history. Never has there been an economy like that.
ROGAN: And you attribute that to lowering taxes and tariffs.
TRUMP: Yeah. A lot of—Two things. And also, I cut regulations more than anybody else. And if—I asked many of the businessmen, you know, from the big companies, you know, the guys running the big companies, I'd say, ""So if you had your choice, you've had it now for a long time. What's more important to you? The tax cuts, you paid less tax, or the regulation cuts?"" Every one of them said the regulation cuts meant more.
Who would think that? Right? Because you don't equate it to dollars, but it actually is more dollars. uh, We had it going and then we just hadta focus on something else. But they were sitting—
ROGAN: So you think—
TRUMP: These two pollsters were sitting there and they said, ""Sir, if George Washington came back and Abraham Lincoln was his VP, as opposed to Walz,"" how bad is he, by the way? But if Abraham Lincoln was his VP, they couldn't beat you. You have a—and I'll never forget it. The following day, they said, ""Something's happening in China, sir. Could we meet?"" I said, ""What's happening?"" ""People are dying."" And it was all around the Wuhan lab, by the way. There are pictures with little lines, they're body bags, all around the Wuhan lab. And I always said that from the beginning, Joe, was, you know, they tried to say, first they said it was France and you know, they blamed everybody.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: But then they say it was bats from a cave 2,000 miles away. So we got hit with that. And despite that, we had the best economy. And when I gave it over, the stock market was higher than it was pre-COVID. I mean, nobody could even believe it. But we saved it. And we were helping businesses. They were dying. You know, they were dying.
ROGAN: So it's your belief that if you had a second term, given the policies in place, the way the economy was booming, that you would have been able to pay off a lot of the debt. And that was the strategy.
TRUMP: If we didn't have COVID, we would have been paying off debt. And we would have had—and don't forget, by growth, the word growth is actually more important in a way, because you could have the same debt. But if you doubled your growth, all of a sudden you're under levered. But still, we should pay off debt. You know, if you viewed this uh, $35 trillion right now, it's a lot.
But if you look at the asset value, if you looked at it purely as an asset value, we have oil underground, we have water, we have mountains, we have—I mean, the assets are so enormous. But regardless of that, we've got $35 trillion in debt, we should pay it off. And we would've started paying off debt and probably even giving further, given further tax reductions.
I want to get it down to 15%. We're gonna do more business. But when you get hit with a COVID, everything stops, and you have to keep these businesses alive. The businesses were dying. I mean, they were just dying. This whole place, this country was gonna die.
ROGAN: Are there influences uh, outside of environmental that keep people from wanting to drill for oil and frack and do those sorts of things? Outside of the environmental concerns, which are legitimate, of course.
TRUMP: Yeah, no.
ROGAN: But are there other influences that maybe over-accentuate or over-exaggerate these environmental effects? Are, are people being influenced in a way where they're trying to keep us from producing American oil?
TRUMP: Yeah. Yeah.
ROGAN: Yeah?
TRUMP: So the environmental is the biggest tool for stopping growth, the biggest tool. The other is regulation. And if you speak to Elon, he said the regulation now to send a rocket up to anywhere, even if you do everything, it's almost, it's becoming impossible. But they use environmental in order to get people not to do anything. And sometimes I say, you know, I look at some of the, I know the environmental stuff better because I had to build buildings in New York.
I had to build, I had to do environmental impact studies. And I would see some of these guys that I'd hire for a lot of money, environmentalists that would get you through the process. And they'd be up in Albany, that's the capital of New York, and they're up there trying to make it tougher for guys like me that were builders because they'd get paid more money. In other words, I, I had one guy, uh, highly recommended, all, you know, I was good at getting permits. I was one of the kings of, I was always very good. But the environmental stuff was always horrible. They could slow a project down 10 years, 15 years. I had a project in Louisiana, built—big LNG plant. It was, uh, for 14 years, it was gonna cost $18 million—$18 billion, one of the biggest, like the Empire State Building, laying down on its side, times four, massive, on the coast, on the Gulf Coast. And they said, ""Sir, they're gonna give it up."" I said, ""They shouldn't give it up. What's the problem?"".
""They can't get their environmental."" They had environmental permits that would fill this whole room up to the ceiling. And they said there was one mistake on one little line, they wanted 'em do it all over again. I said, ""It's not gonna happen."" And I got them their permit instantly. And they built the plant, it's massive.
ROGAN: So when you're saying that—
TRUMP: The weapon.
ROGAN: So there's people that are making money by making it difficult. Are you talking about lawyers? Because they're dragging out—
TRUMP: No, I'm talking about environmental—
ROGAN: the process?
TRUMP:—consultants and lawyers.
ROGAN: Environmental consultants, profit off of dragging out the process.
TRUMP: Absolutely.
ROGAN: And how do they profit?
TRUMP: They make the process worst.
ROGAN: How do they profit off of it?
TRUMP: And I'd probably do the same thing if I were them, to be honest with you, you know?
ROGAN: That's business, men.
TRUMP: I want to be honest with you.
ROGAN: How do they do that? How do they make it?
TRUMP: They go, let's say New York, they go to Albany.
ROGAN: Okay.
TRUMP: And they convince people that if you have a certain type of plant on the ground that's this big, and in theory valueless, that it's a rare plant, and you cannot ever—even touch it, you can't go near it, you can't put a building on it, you can't do anything. Or there's a little puddle, and they call it a lake, and you have to go by the standards of a lake. I said, ""No, no, that's a puddle."" Oh, you have no idea. Guys are filling a little puddle. You have no idea what they do. And they use it as a way to stop you.
ROGAN: They use it as a way to stop you and also as a way to generate money.
TRUMP: It's a weapon.
ROGAN: I'm curious at how are they generating money that way, though?
TRUMP: Well, they get fees.
ROGAN: They get fees?
TRUMP: Massive fees. And you pay these guys.
ROGAN: And people rely on them as experts, because they're the people that they go to when they have to run these studies in the first place?
TRUMP: Yeah, but some of them are just bad guys, and they're trying to make it more and more difficult.
ROGAN: And they have a lot of power?
TRUMP: Yeah, ah, I, I think they maybe had more. They didn't have as much with me, because I would get through them, and I understood it. Look, I've had, I've done so many, they call it environmental impact study. I did so much. To build a building. To build a building in New York is very tough. You've got to deal with, think of it, financing, unions, uh, all the municipal stuff, environmental. Of all of it, to me, the toughest thing was the environmental, because they could stop you cold with the environmental impact study stuff. And, and you hire a so-called expert, and they say, ""Sir, he's the one guy who can get you through the morass."" It's a morass. It's horrible. They use it as a weapon. They use it all over the country.
ROGAN: Right. But there are legitimate concerns about environmental impact, correct?
TRUMP: There are. There are but.
ROGAN: Like, look about the BP oil spill.
TRUMP: Sure.
ROGAN: There's a lot of things that do happen that are environmentally devastating.
TRUMP: Sure, yeah.
ROGAN: And you want to mitigate that as much as possible.
TRUMP: You do. You do. Look, I had—during our four years, we had the cleanest air and the cleanest water. I view it differently. I say air and water. Remember this. It costs much more to do things environmentally clean. China doesn't do anything.
ROGAN: Right.
When Kerry goes to see uh, President Xi at China, which he probably doesn't even get to see him, but they look at him, ""Oh, yes, yes, we will do, oh, yes, yes, we're gonna do that. No more coal, no more coal. Just—"" And then they approve 58 coal plants for the next, you know, every, they build a coal plant a week, okay.
ROGAN: They built a lot of coal plants. We've covered that.
TRUMP: But let me just tell you, though, so here we are cleaning and scrubbing everything and everything's got to—and the air's got to be pure. But in 3.8 days, that stuff floating over China is right over the top of us.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: Same thing with the oceans. They dump their garbage into the Pacific Ocean. If you take a little cork and put it there, in about a week and a half, it'll be in front of Los Angeles. We're picking up their garbage. So, nobody ever talks about that. But in a way, the bigger one is even—the air. It's the currents. It's an amazing thing. It's been flowing that way for a million years, long before we were there.
ROGAN: We share air with the whole world. Yeah.
TRUMP: No. If we're cleaning—
ROGAN: We get the Sahara dust clouds over here.
TRUMP: Absolutely.
ROGAN: We get dust clouds in Austin from the Sahara Desert.
TRUMP: But we get the China, uh, you know, they call it the China curse. We get the China curse, they're bad, and their air is dirty. You know, when I went there, uh, I had a great relationship with President Xi. We got along very well. And they treated me better than anybody's ever been treated. Same thing with Saudi Arabia, a number of them. But they laid it out. And I said, ""This air is good."" Do you know, they closed every factory one week before I got there, from within 200 miles.
ROGAN: That's like what Gavin Newsom did when Xi Jinping came to San Francisco.
TRUMP: He cleaned it up.
ROGAN: He cleaned it up. He got rid of all the homeless people.
TRUMP: Isn't that terrible in a way? To think, you know, he cleaned it up, and then it became a pigsty.
ROGAN: Well, the dumbest thing is, he said, ""When your friends come by, when you have visitors, you clean up your house."" Like, how about just keep your fucking house clean?
TRUMP: Can you imagine?
ROGAN: That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard anybody say, ever, as a Governor, as to excuse to why you finally cleaned up your homeless problem.
TRUMP: And the day he left.
ROGAN: Right back to it.
TRUMP: It went right back.
ROGAN: Yeah.
TRUMP: But in a way, that was a bad thing that he did. Because he showed—
ROGAN: He showed it could be done.
TRUMP: What a disgrace that was. What a disgrace.
ROGAN: Well, this is the thing that, like, shows you how foolish a lot of these people that are running these cities think, and a lot of these people that are running these states think. It's foolish. like You're insulting the intelligence of the people that live in that city that are impacted by these people just camping, and needles, and human feces. There's uh, an app that you can buy. There's an app that you can get, rather, that will show you where the human feces has been documented in San Francisco.
It's a poo app. And it's just everywhere. It's just bum crap. Everywhere.
TRUMP: But let me give you one that you may not know, which I think you know everything, actually.
ROGAN: That's not true.
TRUMP: As a student of yours. But water. you know, In—
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP:—Los Angeles, you can't get proper amounts of water and it's unbelievably expensive, and you might have a house in Beverly Hills, and they're actually thinking about rationing water. Can you believe it?
ROGAN: I could believe it. I used to live there.
TRUMP: I was, I was in the farm country with some of the congressmen. We're driving up a highway and I say, ""How come all this land is so barren?"" It's farmland and it looked terrible. It was just brown and bad. I said, ""But there's always that little corner that's so green and beautiful."" They said, ""We have no water."" I said, ""Do you have a drought?"" ""No, we don't have a drought."" I said, ""Why don't you have no water?"" Because the water isn't allowed to flow down. It's got a natural flow from Canada all the way up north of water, more water than they could ever use. And in order to protect a tiny little fish, the water up north gets routed into the Pacific Ocean. Millions and millions of gallons of water gets poured.
You gotta see this. We're driving up and I had never seen it before. It's the most—it's like Iowa. It's the most fertile land. Iowa's blessed with great land. Idaho for a potato, right?
ROGAN: Yeah.
TRUMP: But, they're just—by the way, some land is good for a potato. Some land is good for corn. It's the craziest thing. I love the farmers. They're great. They're the greatest. And by the way, they're getting killed right now.
ROGAN: They are.
TRUMP: They're getting killed because of this stupid Administration. But, so I see this and I said, ""You got to be kidding."" I said, ""You mean you have water?"" And I looked at it, it's like a valve in your sink, except it's massive. The thing's five times taller than your ceiling.
ROGAN: Did you know the center of California was a giant lake?
TRUMP: They have so much water.
ROGAN: You ever see what it looks like before they rerouted it?
TRUMP: No, I never saw that. No.
ROGAN: The center of California, what is it, 200 years ago? How long ago did they do that, Jamie?
JAMIE One second.
ROGAN: The center of California had a fucking enormous lake in the middle of California.
TRUMP: So they dumped it into the Pacific.
ROGAN: Who knows what they did. But whatever foolishness that they did led to the situation they're in now.
TRUMP: Think of those dry forests that burned down all over. You know, the head of Austria said—
ROGAN: Here it is. Tulare Lake or Tache Lake. It's a freshwater lake in the southern San Joaquin Valley, United States. Historically, Tulare Lake was one of the largest freshwater lakes west of the Mississippi. Show a photo of what it looked like back then.
TRUMP: That's a great system.
ROGAN: So that's what it looked like. Look at that image. Now the one—Go to the one on the third from the right.
TRUMP: Yeah.
ROGAN: Yeah. That was an enormous lake in the middle of California.
TRUMP: What a beautiful thing.
ROGAN: Imagine that.
TRUMP: That'd be much more valuable property.
ROGAN: How crazy is that? But how crazy is that's what it used to look like and human beings screwed that up.
TRUMP: No, they let it go into the Pacific and then they did something.
ROGAN: I don't know what they did. What did they do? How did it go missing?
TRUMP: Wow.
JAMIE They said they drained it in '83.
TRUMP: Yeah, they drained it.
ROGAN: 1983. Oh my God.
JAMIE It went dry a handful of times.
ROGAN: Oh, it went dry a handful of times. Well, lakes do go dry, but that's a big one.
TRUMP: But think of it—
ROGAN: That's a big one to go dry.
TRUMP: You could have all of the water you need, all of that land would have more water. The whole thing could be like that little patch. Literally, literally I'd say—I was with Devin Nunes, a congressman and other congressmen, we were going up. I was visiting them because they asked me to go up and visit their territory and I did. But I kept saying, ""Look at this land. It's beautiful, but it's so dry."" And I thought they were going through like a desert like a drought. They said, ""No, we have water, but it gets—"" So I looked into it.
ROGAN: What is the fish?
TRUMP: And I got it done. I got it done. I could have water for all of that land, water for your forests. you know, Your forests are dry as a bone, okay?
ROGAN: Yeah. Dangerous.
TRUMP: That water could be routed. you know, You could have everything. Not only dangerous, billions of dollars a year they spend on forest fires. And you know, there's a case with the environment. They're not allowed to rake their forests because you're not allowed to touch it. When a tree falls down, after 18 months it becomes very dry. It's like you know, real firewood. It's bad.
A tree that's up, these are all things I learned the hard way, the easy way. But when a tree is up, it sucks water. It's wet. I went to, that, they had a couple of horrible forest fires in California and I went. I said, ""You got a lot of trees standing."" ""They were healthy trees, sir."" I said, with this intense heat that you could see they were charred a little bit on the bottom, but they were gonna be all right because they're soaking wet because they suck up the water, right?
But when they fall, they're like—it's like lighting a match and you got to be able to clean. They call maintain your forest. So I was with the head of Austria. He said, ""You know what? It's a shame. I see all those forest fires in California and all they have to do is clean their forest,"" meaning rake it up, get rid of the leaves, you know, get rid of leaves that are sitting there for five years and—
ROGAN: Well certainly get rid of the dead fall.
TRUMP: And get rid of the trees that have fallen that are like —So many things, this country, by the way, I had it all—
ROGAN: Could you really rake the whole forest though? I don't think you could rake the whole forest. I think you can get rid of the dead fall, but raking all the leaves—
TRUMP: You could certainly get rid of the dead, okay?
ROGAN: Yeah, I think that's the real issue is the dead fall.
TRUMP: Environmentally, they don't want to do that. They said no no, it's got to be nature and all this stuff. But in the meantime, this is exactly—But you could have—So it was the Department of Commerce that needed the approvals, but Gavin Newsom had to sign them. I got it all done. Nobody could believe it. It was all done. I said, ""I got it."" You got so much water. All you have to do is sign. And that guy didn't wanna sign.
ROGAN: Did he not want to sign because that would be a political victory for you?
TRUMP: I think, no, he didn't. No, I don't think so. He used to say he's a great President, and we got along. We did. We actually got along at that point. But I think somebody said, "" uh, You just can't continue to call him a great President."" you know, They do say that. But we had it all done. He didn't sign. And then we got onto other things. And I said—every time I go to California, I said, ""You have so much water."" They don't know it. I'm telling you, people living in Beverly Hills, they turn off their water. Same thing with the electric. They want to go to all electric cars, but they have brownouts every weekend you know.
ROGAN: Well, right after they made the announcement that as of 2035, you're not gonna be able to buy an internal combustion engine in California. like Within a month they had some announcement asking people to not charge their Tesla's because the grid couldn't handle it. Well, how are you gonna handle—
TRUMP: I'll terminate the mandate immediately, this mandate.
ROGAN: Good. Thank you.
TRUMP: That will be done, I would say in my first day, maybe two days, because it's a little bit busy.
ROGAN: Let me ask you about nuclear. One, one of the things that when I've talked to people that have a real understanding of nuclear power, they, what their position is, it's probably the cleanest, safest form of electricity that we could generate and that the fears of nuclear power are really about a few disasters. The Fukushima, Three Mile Island, uh, these are old systems and they—they're much more capable now and they're capable of making even better systems. But it's a difficult political issue because you think nuclear power, you think Chernobyl, that's what everybody does. They have this connection in their heads that the potential—
TRUMP: Or Fukushima where you're not supposed to enter the land for 3,000 years or something. It's crazy.
ROGAN: I think it's worse than that. I think that area is like gonna be radioactive for probably longer than you could imagine. But, the, the point is they're better at it now and that they could do it now. And you can generate power in a way that you don't have to worry about these—one of the most ridiculous things is electric cars being powered by coal- fired plants. It's a ridiculous thing.
TRUMP: It's what's happening.
ROGAN: Yeah, it is what's happening.
TRUMP: That's what's happening.
ROGAN: And people want to think they're being green, but it's—
TRUMP: Well, if you look at the way the battery is made. But here's the other thing. We don't have—well, we do actually. It's being held. We have certain areas where we have great raw earth material and we're not allowed to use it because of the environment. And we have areas in California that have incredible raw earth and they're not allowing, and I'm gonna open it up. I'm gonna let 'em use it. China—
ROGAN: But how do you do that and protect the environment?
TRUMP: Because the environment's gonna be protected. You can do it. You can make a lake out of it, okay? We'll put back a lake. I mean, something nice about lakes. You can do things magnificently—
ROGAN: You just have to do it carefully and responsibly.
TRUMP: Absolutely. You have to do it carefully. But the problem, you know, China has all of those areas, most of those areas, and yet when they say go electric with the cars, China's gonna be the one that gives us the cars. All of those guys in Detroit are gonna be out of business. You're gonna make your electric cars over there.
We have a thing called gasoline, and we have more oil and gas under our feet than any other nation. you know, I had in Alaska, there's a find, it's called ANWR. I got it approved. Reagan couldn't get it. Nobody could get it. I got it all done. It was amazing. They were getting ready to start drilling, the equivalent, they think, of Saudi Arabia, one of the biggest finds in the world. It was all set to go and Biden comes in, his, one of his first orders were, we're not gonna use it. It would've been so good for the—We could have supplied all of Asia with oil and gas.
ROGAN: What was the negative about it?
TRUMP: And you talk about money—
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: The negative was politically, they didn't think it was good for them. That's all.
ROGAN: That's all it was. So you don't think that it's environmentally dangerous?
TRUMP: No. Taking it from way down deep in the earth. Environmentally would've been fine.
ROGAN: So it can be done responsibly?
TRUMP: Absolutely. Or otherwise—
ROGAN: To the point where it protects the environment.
TRUMP: Well, I think windmills—Okay, so they talk about windmills.
ROGAN: It's a good point.
TRUMP: I think windmills are really disruptive. When you talk about the environment, they kill the birds. You want to see a bird cemetery, go under a windmill someday that hasn't been cleaned out with all the bird carcasses. You, it's like massive amounts of birds.
ROGAN: They're also a massive eyesore.
TRUMP: Oh, they're horrible.
ROGAN: I went to a ranch in south Texas. We had to drive past this enormous windmill farm, and it's gross. It's dystopian. You're looking in the left and the right and all you see is these big spinning machines that aren't even that effective at generating electricity.
TRUMP: Correct. Most expensive form of electricity is a windmill, and then they start to rust and rot.
ROGAN: And you have to replace them.
TRUMP: And then they get abandoned by the people that built them because—
ROGAN: Well, you have to get rid of all that material too. When you replace those blades, now you have a problem because you have to dispose.
TRUMP: You can't bury them.
ROGAN: Right. You have to dispose these enormous windmills. And how do you dispose of them?
TRUMP: By the way, they say you can't bury them. So, I even questioned that, but I'm not gonna get into it. But they say you can't bury them. So you have the blades and you can't bury the blades. You can bury the blades. It's not gonna matter. You can bury. You'll find areas you can bury. But they come up, this is what I mean, they come up with this, but the environmentalist dream is windmills everywhere. You know what happens to them? After five years, they start to rot. After 10 years, you have to replace them. Did you ever look at certain parts of California where they have heavy windmills and they've been abandoned and they're all different manufacturers and all different companies and they all—
ROGAN: I haven't seen that.
TRUMP: It is the ugliest thing. It looks like a graveyard almost, a graveyard of windmills.
ROGAN: It's pollution.
TRUMP: It's so bad. And the oceans—
ROGAN: It's no different than leaving garbage on the ground.
TRUMP: How about in New Jersey? Off the coast of New Jersey, they wanna build, the people are going crazy not to build them. But where you have them, the whales are washing up on shore. So in 50 years they had one whale come ashore. Now they had like 18 come in the last year.
ROGAN: What is happening with the whales? I've read about this.
TRUMP: Well, they say that the wind drives them crazy. It's a vibration because you have those—those things are 50 story buildings some of them. Fifty!
ROGAN: Right. And they're super sensitive to vibrations and sounds.
TRUMP: The wind is rushing, the things are blowing. It's a vibration and it makes noise. You know what it is? I want to be a whale psychiatrist. It drives the whales frickin' crazy and something happens with them. But for whatever reason, they're getting washed up on shore. And yet the environmentalists—
ROGAN: Conveniently ignored by the environmental people.
TRUMP: But the environmentalists, they don't talk about it. I think there's nothing uglier. I see it Scotland. I see it all over the world. You have this beautiful valley. It's been there for, in civilization, thousands of years, but millions of years, and all of a sudden you have these ugly windmills up.
ROGAN: Would your plan to be replace that with nuclear? What would you do?
TRUMP: Well, nuclear is better. I, I think there's a little danger, nuclear, but we had some really bad nuclear. They did one in Alabama. They did one in, I think, South Carolina. They do them wrong. They build these massive things. Then the environmentalists get in—I don't want to go into a long story because it's too long for the show. This show is too valuable to talk about concrete, but they have hardened concrete. It's number 12 concrete. It's the hardest. It's harder than steel. It's incredible. They put up a wall and an inspector comes along those—""Nope, nope. You're a quarter of an inch too—"" The wall might be eight feet wide. You're a quarter of an inch too short. I'm sorry. You got to rip down the wall. You got to—Because it's got to be poured contiguously. You're one quarter of an inch—I'm sorry, rip down. You can't rip it down. This stuff, you can't put a hammer through it. It's incredible. Concrete technology is unbelievable what's you know, what's happened. You think of concrete—
ROGAN: So you think that's an example of over-regulation, pointless over-regulation?
TRUMP: Well, you have an inspector that comes along and he says, ""Take down a 25 zillion dollar wall."" These things ended up costing 25 billion dollars. And they, one of them never got opened. But here's the story. So—France does it. France is largely nuclear, and they build small little compact plants, and if they need more, they build the same thing and they hook it up and they hook it up because they get too big and too complex and too expensive. And it is very clean. They say it's it's absolutely—you know, My uncle, I had a great uncle who was a great genius, just like other members of my family, but he was a professor at MIT for I think 41 years. He was the longest—When I was in the White House, the head of MIT, Princeton and Harvard came down to meet me, and the MIT person said, ""I have a book on your uncle Dr. John Trump. He was our longest serving professor. He was a great genius, sir. Do you know how—""
And uh, he knew everything about nuclear. From math to chemistry to nuclear, he knew it. And he said, ""Someday it's got to be the way to go."" But the problem is it's so dangerous in terms of war. He said, ""Donald, someday,""—this was a long time, Uncle John, Dr. John Trump, he said, ""Someday you'll have a little satchel at your side and you'll go into a building and you'll be able to blow up New York City."" I said, ""Uncle John, that'll never happen."" He's right. you know, He's right.
ROGAN: Well, that was part of the problem—
TRUMP: The power is so great.
ROGAN:—with giving nuclear power to other countries, right? That was the problem that happened with India and Pakistan. They got nuclear power and then they were able to weaponize it.
TRUMP: The biggest problem in the world today is not global warming. It's nuclear warming. And we have idiots that are negotiating for us. We have a guy that doesn't make it past four o'clock, and it's not because of age. you know, I know so many guys in their late 80s, and they're better than—I said to one guy the other day, ""I think you're smarter than you were 25 years ago."" I've known him a long time. He's 89 years old. He's sharp as—I mean, he's great. Biden gives people a bad name because that's not an old—that's not an age. I think they say it because I'm three or four years younger. you know, I think that's why they say it. They say his age. It's not his age. He's got a problem.
ROGAN: Had two major brain surgeries.
TRUMP: Operations, yeah. He did. He did. Those are not good operations.
ROGAN: And did you see what he did today? He went running towards the camera and made some apology to Nav—Native Americans, and uh, he said that's why he is headed out west. like He's off the reservation, so to speak, for lack of a better term.
TRUMP: It's interesting because during the debate, I was uh, looking over him saying, ""This is strange."" Sort of strange things were happening.
ROGAN: Yeah. Well, he couldn't keep it together. But do you think they knew he couldn't keep it together?
TRUMP: I think so.
ROGAN: Do you think that they wanted—Is that why, like historically, that debate was earlier than they've been in the past, right?
TRUMP: I think they wanted to get—Well, there's a lot of theories. A lot of people said, do the debate now and we'll get him out.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: I think that maybe could be.
ROGAN: Well, that is what happened. So it's logical to assume that's the one.
TRUMP: It is what happened. I think they also said do the debate now and get it over with.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: I don't think anybody thought he was gonna get out, really.
ROGAN: It didn't make any sense.
TRUMP: The debate got him out, but I think it's very unfair. Look, you have a bad debate, his numbers went down, but I think she's not doing very well right now, and I think she looks—
ROGAN: Well, I want to get to that too, because it's hard to know. like The whole poll thing is very bizarre for most people because most people don't answer polls. So they read the polls, then like, who's getting polled? I've never been polled. If I did, I'd hang up.
TRUMP: I was never called by a pollster.
ROGAN: If I did, I wouldn't answer. I'm busy.
TRUMP: You know how polls are done? Oh, I'm gonna get myself in trouble.
ROGAN: Please.
TRUMP: So I really don't believe too much in 'em.
ROGAN: Well, 2016 taught a lot of people about the ineffective use of polls.
TRUMP: Well, they were very ineffective because I thought I was doing well. I'd go to a place and I'd have 30, 40,000 people. Hillary would go, they have 500 people. And they tell me I'm gonna lose. I said, ""Why am I gonna lose?"" I had 40,000 people. She had 200 people. But you know, I have a theory, these pollsters, they charge you a lot of money too. you know, They charge you half a million bucks to do some stupid poll and they interview like 251 people. I don't think they interview them in many cases. I don't want to get myself in too much trouble.
ROGAN: Do you think it's bullshit?
TRUMP: No. I think they sit there, they make a deal, they get a half a million bucks, and they say, ""Trump's leading 51 to 49."" They announce it and everybody says, ""Oh, oh."" Do you understand?
ROGAN: Yeah. So you think—
TRUMP: I think in a lot—Look, I'm a very common sense person. I think that they probably don't always poll. Some of them probably never poll. uh, What's the difference between 49 to 51 and 47 and a half?
ROGAN: Well, it's also a tiny percentage of the population. I don't think it's representative of the overall population. I just don't think it is.
TRUMP: I don't know of one person in my whole life that ever got called by a pollster.
ROGAN: Exactly. That's my point. So, here, here's my question—
TRUMP: But I shouldn't say that because I'm doing very, you know, really well in the polls.
ROGAN: But I think that's—
TRUMP: So this week I happen to believe in the numbers. I only believe them if they're good. No, I like them this month. But no, I honestly believe that there's probably a lot of fraud. I had a poll, Washington Post, ABC in the Hillary thing, on Wisconsin. They had me down 17 points the day before the election. I knew it was wrong because I had a rally, I had 29,000 people at a racetrack, and it was like zero degrees, Wisconsin, and they had me down 17 points. In other words, you had no chance. And I won.
And I called up my pollster, good guy, good guy. And I believe he's legitimate. And you know, some of them are, and some of them are. I said, ""Tell me, why did they have me down so much?"" I mean, nobody's gonna believe them the next time. They said they don't care. When you're down 17 points, people are gonna stay home. They're not gonna vote because they're gonna say, ""I love Trump, but I'm not gonna waste my time. It's cold out."" I said, ""But what if they make it four or five?"" He said, ""At four or five, they're gonna go and vote. At 17, they're not gonna go and vote."" But think of it, this is the Washington Post, ABC poll. I was down 17 points in Wisconsin and I won. It's crooked stuff.
ROGAN: There's a lot of crooked stuff, and I wanted to talk about that too, because one of the things that people uh, talk about with you is uh, the denial of the results. And I think JD Vance did a brilliant job the other day when he was being interviewed uh, and they asked him, ""Did Trump lose the 2020 election?"" And he turned it around and said, ""Was there legitimate election interference in suppressing the Hunter Biden laptop story on social media and was that a concerted effort?""
TRUMP: Well, they say it made 10 point difference, and I lost by one, one tenth of a point. They say it was 22,000 votes. But look, it was much more than that. And I appreciate JD Vance saying that. And by the way, I think he was a great pick. Do you like JD?
ROGAN: I like him a lot. Yeah.
TRUMP: You're allowed to say that.
ROGAN: No, I do. I like him a lot.
TRUMP: No, I think he's good.
ROGAN: I think he's a brilliant guy and I think his ability to talk like a normal human being—You did my friend Theo Von's podcast and he [Vance] just did it.
TRUMP: How did he do with it?
ROGAN: He did great. He just talks like a normal human being.
TRUMP: Is that why you called me to do this?
ROGAN: No, no.
TRUMP: I'm only kidding. He was a nice guy.
ROGAN: Once they shot you, I was like, ""He's got to come in here."" It's all about timing. It's all about the timing.
TRUMP: Timing is good.
ROGAN: Timing's perfect. Do you have even have a scar on your ear? You got anything on there?
TRUMP: I do.
ROGAN: Let me see. Let me see what you've got there.
TRUMP: So right over here—
ROGAN: It's a tiny little mark.
TRUMP: It zicked right there.
ROGAN: It healed up pretty fucking good.
TRUMP: Yeah, it's pretty good. Yeah, it's a little—it's not like some of the wrestlers, some of the UFC fighters.
ROGAN: No, you didn't cauliflower ear.
TRUMP: No, no. It got me, was sort of like a top shot. The point of the bullet was [inaudible], but you see the things take it off a little bit, but uh, it makes me a tougher guy. you know, The fighters, the fighters love their—You know Bo Nickal [mixed martial arts fighter]? He is a great fighter.
ROGAN: Yeah, I love Bo Nickals.
TRUMP: How's he gonna do? I think he's terrific.
ROGAN: He's great. He's a fantastic fighter.
TRUMP: He was almost undefeated in college.
ROGAN: Yeah, he's a fantastic wrestler and one of the best mixed martial artists.
TRUMP: When is he fighting again? I want to—
ROGAN: He's fighting in Madison Square Garden in November.
TRUMP: Oh, that's gonna be interes—after the election.
ROGAN: Yep.
TRUMP: So I'll either go as President or I'll be depressed and I won't bother going. I think they're having a fight right after.
ROGAN: One of the things that was fascinating also was the denial of the election results is, is a pretty common thing. Hillary Clinton famously denied that—She called you an illegitimate President and she said that Russia put you in place.
TRUMP: Even though she conceded.
ROGAN: Yes.
TRUMP: you know, She conceded the night of the election because she was beaten.
ROGAN: Yes. And it was a thing that was pretty common for people, especially Democrats, to deny the elections. uh, uh, There's been many of them. The Bush Administration, the you know, the dangling Chads, all that stuff.
TRUMP: Well, look at these guys in Congress. All these sleazebags in Congress that are Democrats, they're still denying 2016, but now they don't so much because you know, they try and pin it on me. You don't hear them say—
ROGAN: But here's my point.
TRUMP:—but they denied it right up until the end.
ROGAN: My point is this idea of election fraud is a forbidden topic, and you get labeled an election denier. It's like being labeled an anti-vaxer if you question some of the health consequences that people have had from the COVID-19 shots. ""Oh my God, you're anti—an anti-vaxer."" If you say, and what I say publicly, and I've said this a lot, it's not 0%. So if you ask me what is the amount of election fraud in this country? Is it 0%? No one thinks it's 0%. I've never met one person, not a, a, a super liberal, progressive, far-left person or a right-wing conservative, not one person thinks it's 0%. They think when you have human beings, and also you have a lot of weirdness that was going on during the 2020 elections, particularly with mail-in ballots.
TRUMP: And you had legislatures that had to approve and they didn't approve and they went out and did it anyway, and you had ballot—you had old-fashioned ballot screwing. I mean, you had people going up and dropping in phony votes. You had unsigned ballots, et cetera, et cetera.
ROGAN: There's certain people that think that they have—And the rhetoric is also that you're Hitler and that in order to stop Hitler, you have to do whatever it takes.
TRUMP: That was okay. Yeah.
ROGAN: Yeah. And you're hearing this now, Kamala compared you to—Said your love of Hitler yesterday.
TRUMP: you know, Kamala is a very low IQ person. She's a very low IQ. I'm for taking tests too. I think anybody that runs for President should take—they should give 'em tests. And it's not an age thing, it's not based—If you look back on history, '70s and '80s, your greatest—some of your greatest leaders in the world, world history, long time, world history, they were in their 70s and their 80s. But I think you should take cognitive tests. I think everybody—they say it's unconstitutional, but I think—
ROGAN: That's ridiculous.
TRUMP: I think Kamala should have a test because there's something missing. There's something wrong with her.
ROGAN: Well, I think it's pressure. I think the pressure and the scrutiny. You've been a celebrity for a long time and you understand what this is like, but for someone who's in her late 40s, who becomes the vice President, who runs for President, becomes the vice President, and then all of a sudden the weight of the world is on your shoulders and there's all these people paying attention. A lot of people clam up.
TRUMP: But you either have it or you don't.
ROGAN: Correct.
TRUMP: Look, this is an interview. You, we've covered a lot of territory right, and it's fine, I don't care. I want to. I think it's much more interesting. She, to do an interview with uh, Anderson Cooper, a softball, crazy softball interview. She took two days off and she studied and studied all day long and then she comes out with a result that was a real embarrassment. That was a really bad interview. She couldn't answer a question. And every question's not answered. I mean, like, ""What would you do your first day in office?"" Okay, I'll build a wall. I won't build a wall. There's a hundred things you can say. Just say anything. uh, There's something off with her.
ROGAN: Well, I also think—
TRUMP: Joe, we're dealing with the smartest people. They hate when I say—When the press, when I call President Xi, they said he called President Xi brilliant. Well, he's a brilliant guy. He controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist. I mean, he's a brilliant guy whether you like it or not, and they go crazy and say, ""Oh—""
ROGAN: Right. It doesn't mean he's not evil or it doesn't mean he's not dangerous.
TRUMP: Yeah, of course not. But actually, we have evil people in our country.
ROGAN: Yes.
TRUMP: If you have a smart President, he can deal with Russia. He can deal with all of it. I had a, I had a—Russia would've never gone into Ukraine if I were President.
ROGAN: How would you have stopped it?
TRUMP: Automatic. Two things. I told him. I said, ""Vladimir, you're not going in."" I used to talk to him all the time. ""You're not going in."" I can't tell you what I told him because I think it would be inappropriate. But someday he'll tell you. But he would've never gone in. But you know why else he wouldn't have gone in? Oil prices at $40 a barrel wouldn't have allowed him, wouldn't have given him the money to prosecute that war. Wouldn't have given him the money.
I said it with President—I was with President Xi. I said—It was almost the same conversation. With Vladimir, it was Moscow. With President Xi, it was Beijing. It was almost the exact same conversation. I said, ""Don't do it."" He would've never done it.
The day I left, they flew 28 bombers over the middle of Taiwan, 28 bombers. And it's the apple of his eye. And the same thing with Russia. It's the apple. Ukraine is the apple of his eye. I used to talk to him. I had a very good relationship with him. He wouldn't have done it. He would've never done it.
But he also wouldn't have done it because of the oil. You know, one of the reasons that what happened is, number one, he doesn't respect Biden at all. Not even a little bit. And who the hell would? But he doesn't respect him. But when he saw what happened in Afghanistan, how horribly that was handled, number one, you take the soldiers out last, not first, okay? That was their big mistake. And we had that thing charted out and they weren't obeying us. They weren't—uh, Abdul is the head of the Taliban. Boom, boom, he had to do all these things. Some he didn't do. I said, ""Nope, you're not do—you gotta do them all.""
This guy, he immediately took all—He left the equipment behind. 13 soldiers dead. But he took everybody out. He took his soldiers out before. A child would know—that's where Milley was so stupid. He was such a stupid guy, Milley. Okay, those generals should have all been fired, the Afghan. The people that were involved with Afghanistan should have all been fired. Then they'd be writing books about him, how stupid he was and bad he was. But you take your soldiers out last.
I had a, a big rally and I saw a child in the front row uh, about a year and a half ago, and I called the child up. I said, ""Do you mind if I borrow your child?"" ""Oh, yes, please."" And they came up. Kids five years—I gave them quick details. I said, ""We want to get out of this place, and we have this, and we have this, and we have the equipment."" I gave him a little thing. I said, ""Do you take your soldiers out first or last after everything's done?"" ""You take them out last, sir."" A child would know that. We took our soldiers out first.
ROGAN: What was your plan—
TRUMP: And we left Bagram.
ROGAN: Well, not only that, we left billions of dollars worth of equipment and military vehicles that they use for parades now.
TRUMP: The best, the best equipment yet, to embarrass us, the best equipment in the world.
ROGAN: The Taliban parade where they got tanks rolling down the streets and Blackhawks flying is the craziest thing I've ever seen.
TRUMP: We left—
ROGAN: The fact that we left all that stuff there.
TRUMP:—the best equipment in the world behind.
ROGAN: What would you have done differently?
TRUMP: Well, number one, we would've taken it out. Just so you—Go back a little bit further. I had a couple of conversations with Abdul, and from the time I had those conversations, because they were shooting our soldiers with the sniper stuff. They were shooting, they were shooting a lot of them. They were shooting a lot with Obama, much less with me, but they were shooting 'em. And I said, ""Get this guy on the phone."" The press went nuts when they heard this. I had a great conversation with—It was a tough conversation.
Eighteen months later, there wasn't one soldier that was ever shot at, and even Biden admitted it in a moment of stupidity because he shouldn't admit it. His people went nuts. He said, ""Yeah, well, I will admit no soldier—"" We didn't have a soldier killed in 18 months in Afghanistan. Not one soldier was killed because he understood what was gonna happen if that happened. I didn't have one soldier.
So then when I left, after having gotten more votes than any sitting President in the history of the country, and much more votes than I got in 2016, when I left, they started shooting our soldiers. But more importantly, what they did is they did that whole thing with you know, leaving. He shouldn't have left. Number one, should have left from Bagram because Bagram's this massive base, it's got tremendous acreage around it, tremendous. It's a very big—It was built many years ago and part of the reason you wouldn't have taken that is because it goes to China, one hour from where China makes its nuclear missiles. You should have never left Bagram, number one. They should have left from Bagram. They should have left last. They shoulda got—you know, we have Americans that are still there. They should have taken all their equipment out, everything, every plane, every screw should have been taken out, every tent. And I said that. That's when I realized that Milley was a dummy. I said, ""We're leaving, but I want to get everything out."" ""Sir, it's cheaper to leave it."" I said, ""What do you mean leave it?""
ROGAN: It's cheaper to leave it?
TRUMP: Yeah, he said it's cheaper to leave it. That was his—
ROGAN: Cheaper?
TRUMP: Cheaper. He said, it's cheaper. ""Sir—
ROGAN: Not more dangerous?
TRUMP: He just said cheaper. I said, ""I want every plane. I want every tank. I want the goggles."" They have night goggles. They have all this stuff that these guys now have. He said, ""Sir, it's cheaper to get out and leave it."" I said, ""So you think it's cheaper to leave $150 million brand new airplane in there than it is to fly it out with a tank of jet fuel and put it in Pakistan or just fly it directly back?"" ""It's cheaper to leave it."" I said, ""This guy's nuts."" I'm telling you, he was so stupid. He was so unwise. He was like an unwise man. And there were a number of them.
But I defeated ISIS with the greatest generals. I had a guy who was so great. I flew to Iraq and I met the real generals, not these idiots that we deal with. And we knocked out—you know, I defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate. They said it would take five years. I did it in a matter of a few—literally a few weeks. And we hit them hard. And he said, ""Sir, we're gonna hit them here. We're gonna hit them there. We're gonna hit him here, there."" And I said, ""This guy's great. I like this guy."" I was told it would take five years. That's why I went. I said, ""How could it take five years? We have brand new fighters, we have the best planes, the best weapons, the best guns, the best bombs. How could it possibly take that long?""
And I flew to, I flew in, left at three o'clock in the morning. Nobody knew I was going. I got on Air Force One and we started flying, and when we reached about half an hour away from Iraq, that was where the airport was, big airport, about a half an hour away, they said, ""Sir, I'm sorry, you'll have to turn off all your lights."" ""Why?"" ""We're getting close to our site, our land."" I said, ""We spent $8 trillion that we can't leave the lights."" Think of this, 20 years, $8 trillion that we can't leave the lights on in a plane. I said, ""That's okay. Turn the lights off. I'm not gonna fight them this one.""
ROGAN: This is because it's too dangerous?
TRUMP: Yeah, too dangerous because they see the light up in the air.
ROGAN: They shoot at it.
TRUMP: They'll shoot at it. So, uh, I said, ""Turn the lights off."" Then they said, sir, we're gonna also pull your shades if that's okay."" Said, ""That's okay."" The plane pitch black. All the lights outside, the blinking they call them the blinking reds. They were all turned off. And I like to sit with pilots a lot of times, and these guys are specimens. I always say they're better looking than Tom Cruise. And they're even taller, like perfect specimens. These guys, like for a fighter, you have some guys that are perfect specimens, these guys. you know, They pick the best pilots in the United States Air Force to fly Air Force One.
And I get up there and I'm sitting—I'm feeling my way up. It's up high because 747s you go through the stairs. But I sort of knew my way up. There wasn't a light in the plane. I'm saying, ""Can you imagine? We spent trillions of dollars and we're trying to fly in blind."" But I got into the plane. The cockpit is dark black, little, tiny light, you could see the pilot, a perfect looking human being. His copilot, everybody was perfect. They were all like movie stars. you know, I could have cast a movie with these guys and nobody would believe it because they were too good-looking. So I said, ""How are we doing, Captain?"" ""Sir, we'll be landing in 10 minutes."" And I look outside, there's not a light. And I'm sitting—you know, I've landed a lot of planes and you see little lights at least. There's nothing. It's just pure desert. And I said, ""Okay, Captain, good."" But I'm looking. Now we're—you've been to many planes where it has the computer sign saying 1,000 feet.
It goes, ""1,000, 900, 800."" It's a computer voice but it sounds like—But it's an incredible voice. ""700."" I say, ""Captain, are we okay?"" I'm looking. ""Are we okay, Captain? uh, There's no lights."" And I'm looking—normally when you land—Because I sit with pilots a lot. I think it's great. I think it's a great profession, everything. They're incredible. These machines are incredible. He said, ""Sir, we're fine. No problem, sir."" I said—I'm going, ""I don't see any lights up there, Captain. Sure we're okay?"" So, I'm exaggerating a little bit. Problem with exaggerating, they'll tell the story, they'll say, ""Trump was a coward."" So I'm sitting with him. He goes, ""500"" And I'm telling you, there wasn't a light on the runway, nothing. And we're going in. ""You okay, Captain? Everything good?"" ""Yes, sir. No problem. We'll be down in about one minute, sir."" And I'm telling you, Joe, you know, there's always a light. There's not a little pin.
And all of a sudden, pssh and you hear it, bah, bah, perfect landing like glass. That's how good—These guys between the equipment and—it's genius. It's pure—it was so dark, you couldn't see a thing. There was no runway. You wouldn't know where the hell you are. You're in the middle of a desert. And then I got out of the plane, I said, ""Thank you, Captain. It's a great job."" And then I got out of the plane and I'm going down and I see a general and another general, and I see a staff sergeant, a drill sergeant and various guys, all central casting. Central casting. They said, ""Sir, would you like to rest?"" I said, ""I don't want to rest. I want to figure out what the hell are we doing with ISIS? I'm hearing, we can't—it's gonna take years."" ""No sir. We can do it very quickly, sir.""
And, anyway, we go into the room. Biden would've taken a nap for four days and then left without a meeting. So we go into the room and they have these guys. I say, "" How long can you do it? How long?"" ""We can do it in a couple of weeks, sir."" I said, ""Wait a minute. They told me five years."" ""We can do it in—"" I don't know. He gave me a number like oohh [gestures], like in no time. I said, ""Why haven't you done it?"" ""Because the orders came in from Washington, sir. And they would come here and tell us what to do."" ""Don't you challenge those or—?"" ""We're not allowed to do that, sir. That's not the military way. They tell us what to do and we have to respect them. I just—
ROGAN: So do you think that it was incompetence why they didn't go after ISIS? Do you—
TRUMP: I think it's a bad system. When Mattis goes there or when Milley goes there, who's stupid, and they tell these guys that are actually smart what to do, and the guys that are smart are saying, ""We don't like what they're doing."" But they're not allowed to, sort of, counteract. Plus the guys that went there are arrogant. you know, They're arrogant fools. They're stupid fools. uh, the way they pulled out, you know as an example, the way they pulled out of Afghanistan with the people falling off the planes—
ROGAN: It was a disgrace.
TRUMP: It was worse than Vietnam with the helicopters falling. It was so bad. There was no reason for it. Anyway, so we knocked them out and we have great military, we have great people, but not the television guys. And I rebuilt the military and then they gave a chunk of it—I have to tell you, as much as it is, it's a tiny little piece. Believe it or not. We have an unbelievable—I rebuilt the military. I rebuilt our nuclear, and in a way I hated to redo it, but I got to realize how powerful that nuclear is. Joe, one bomb, Israel is gone. But forget. One bomb could take out the entire East Coast. It's so bad.
And I watched these poor fools talking about our oceans will rise one-eighth of an inch over the next 500 years. I mean, we have people, we have countries, right now you have five countries. And don't underestimate, North, North Korea, if you take a look at North Korea, their nuc—I was there. I was with Kim Jong. I got along great rel—I got along great with him. you know, The press is, ""He got along good."" That's a good thing. It's not a bad thing. It's a great thing. Obama thought we were gonna go to war with North Korea. When I met with Obama just prior to the takeover, you know, you meet, you have sort of a ceremonial meeting, but it lasted a long time, a lot longer than it was supposed to last. I said, ""What's the biggest problem?"" He said, ""North Korea."" By the time I finished, I was, we had no problem with North Korea. We were really—It was a little tough at the beginning, remember?
ROGAN: Mm-hmm.
TRUMP: He said, ""I have a red button on my desk."" I said, ""I have a red button also, but mine's bigger than yours and mine works.""
ROGAN: I liked how you called them Little Rocket Man.
TRUMP: Yeah, Little Rocket—I said, ""Little Rocket Man, you're gonna burn in hell."" And it was a rough—Oh, so rough that people were worried. This is crazy. And then one day I got a call, sort of like a fight. I got a call. You ever see one of them pounding fight? And then all of a sudden, but I got a call and it was from him, meaning his people, they wanted to meet. They wouldn't meet Obama. He tried to meet. They wouldn't even talk to him about it. And I think he expected to go to war. I actually do. I believe he expected to go. And we checked their nuclear stockpile. It is substantial. I mean it's, I said—I got to know him very well. I got to know him better than anybody. Anybody. And I said, ""Do you ever do anything else? Why don't you go take it easy and relax? Go to the beach. You have beautiful beach, nice beachfront property."" you know, Kiddingly. I said, ""You're always building nuclear, just relax. You don't have to do it. Let's build some condos on your shoreline."" They actually have gorgeous stuff.
And he said, "" uh, I just have to do it because I need it for my safety et cetera."" I got to know him very well. We had no problem with him. If you have a smart problem—If you have a smart, really the right President, the smart President, you're not gonna have a problem. And I say it to people, we have a bigger problem, in my opinion, with the enemy from within. And it drives 'em crazy when I use that term. But we have an enemy from within. We have people that are really bad people that I really think want to make this country unsuccessful. When you look at what's happening at our border, Joe, when you have people coming in that—When other countries are allowed to empty their prisons into our country with murderers—We had 13,099 murderers dropped in our country over the last three years.
ROGAN: And 15,000 rapists, convicted.
TRUMP: Rapists, drug dealers, drug lords, terrorists.
ROGAN: And that's just the ones that have been accounted for.
TRUMP: Correct. People from mental institutions.
ROGAN: What do you think the strategy is?
TRUMP: Hundreds to hundreds of thousands of major criminals, tougher and worse than anybody we have. These are—
ROGAN: Well, we're seeing the consequences of it in San Antonio. They've taken over apartment buildings in Aurora, Colorado. They've taken over—
TRUMP: That's right.
ROGAN: Apartment buildings, these Venezuelan gangs.
TRUMP: Just the beginning.
ROGAN: What do you think the strategy is? you know, One of the things that they've said is that you stopped a bill from being passed. But didn't that bill also include amnesty for the people that are already here?
TRUMP: This is years after the fact. The damage was already done.
ROGAN: But what was the bill? What was the problem with the bill?
TRUMP: And the bill was nothing. It allowed two million people in, they were gonna get amnesty. It was a horrible bill. It didn't protect us at all.
ROGAN: But we should just tell people what the strategy is. So one of the things that's—
TRUMP: Well, [inaudible] what their strategy was.
ROGAN: Their strategy, one of the things that's been very clear is that they've moved a large percentage of these uh, migrants that are coming across the border illegally, they've moved them to swing states. This is what's going on with Springfield, Ohio, right?
TRUMP: They're in swing states. Well, that's not a swing state. I'm gonna win Ohio by a lot. So that's not a swing, but it's called Springfield, Ohio to be exact. And Springfield, Ohio is this very nice community of 52,000 people that just had 32,000 migrants that don't speak the language dropped into their community. You can't get into a hospital. You can't get into a school. It's gone from a beautiful little place to a horror show. And the mayor is a nice guy. And the mayor says, ""We're looking for interpreters."" I said, ""No, you've got to remove them and bring them back to their country."" Mostly Haitians in this case. But they speak no, they speak no language. They speak no English.
ROGAN: No English you mean.
TRUMP: In fact, even the language, they do speak, I mean they can't get interpreters. They can't do anything. And the mayor's trying to be politically correct. They're all trying to be. In Aurora, Colorado, you have the, the probably the worst gang—MS-13 might even be—you know, those two are the worst gangs. These are Venezuelan gangs. They have taken over apartment complexes and they're gonna want to take over the whole thing. And you have a weak Governor, pathetic Governor, uh, who's a radical left Democrat. He doesn't know what the hell to do. But you have it in many other communities, but they don't like to talk about it because you know, it's bad for the community to talk about it. These people have been let in here by this imbecile. She's—and I mean it, she's a low IQ person. Low IQ.
ROGAN: But also, it's obviously not just her. There's a strategy that's involved in letting these people in.
TRUMP: Well, she was in charge of the border.
ROGAN: Well, she's in charge of the border, but they also, they, they utilize that app. The app that used to be used—
TRUMP: Sure.
ROGAN: It used to be used, I think essentially, wasn't it for shipping? Wasn't it when people were in this country—
TRUMP: It was used for shipping and now it's used to deal with the cartels. The cartel, heads of the cartel, rich people by the way, these are loaded, these people have so much money. They would call up—think of this: They call up the app and the app tells them where they should take their load of illegal migrants from the Congo. We have a lot from the Congo, prisons in the Congo. uh, I made a little bit of a sarcastic joke. A man named Dana White [CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship], who you love, who I love, I assume you love him. I—
ROGAN: Love that dude.
TRUMP: I think he's in a class by him—He's—
ROGAN: He's probably the reason why you're here.
TRUMP: I, I, I don't know. Maybe.
ROGAN: He's one of the big ones.
TRUMP: He is the greatest guy.
ROGAN: I love him to death.
TRUMP: I always say nobody's indispensable. Everybody can be replaced. Maybe you can't be. You might not be. But they know I truly, I don't think—you know the thing, they sold it for four billion. I said, ""Wha the hell, who the hell is gonna pay four billion?"" And they made like a great deal.
ROGAN: It's worth a lot more than that now.
TRUMP: Because of him. Take him out, I think it's whole different ball game but—
ROGAN: No, he's the best fight promoter of all time.
TRUMP: He's also the greatest guy. He spoke my, at the whole thing with I had just been shot and he got up and he spoke so, better than anybody. I mean, who would be better to introduce you? I asked, of all the people, and I know the biggest people in the world, and they all would've loved to have done it. I said, ""Dana, would you do it?"" you know, It was interesting. He was away. And he said to the people, one of my guys called, said, ""I won't be able to do it. She had just left with my wife and family, I won't."" I said, ""Ooh."" He said, ""No, yeah.""
I was a little surprised, even though I knew he was very far away. He was in some place some—you know, And he deserved it with his family, you know, the whole thing. And then I said, ""All right. That's—"" So we're looking at who are we gonna get. And all of a sudden she comes in, ""Sir, Dana White just said he's going to do it. And he's coming back in tonight. He's taking it."" But, you know, The guy is just an incredible guy. And, he's like a tough champion, but loyal. Yeah, he's got to be one of your favorite people. He's one of my favorite people.
ROGAN: [inaudible]. I love me to death. I've been friends with him for 23 years. I love him to death.
TRUMP: So would you have—uh, Because what you're doing here is incredible. I mean, everybody tells me. All I know is today I'm going—""You're on Joe Rogan today."" People are telling me like that's—. I say, ""How the hell do you know that?"" But, its uh, it's what you've done here is amazing. Where would you be if you didn't do the UFC stuff? Would you have this show, do you think?
ROGAN: Yeah, I would still be doing it for sure. Yeah, I'm doing it—
TRUMP: Would it be at the same level?
ROGAN: I don't know.
TRUMP: But you would have the show?
ROGAN: It's hard to know. I think you know, one of the things that works for this show, I guess, is that I am involved in so many different things. you know, Stand-up, comedy, the UFC and all the interests that I have that lead to the podcast.
TRUMP: Will you always want to do—First of all, you love UFC?
ROGAN: I love it. Yeah.
TRUMP: You love the fights. I watch you. You are loving it. They could pay you nothing, you'd be very—
ROGAN: They didn't pay me anything. For the first 13 shows, I did it for free because they were hemorrhaging money. And I became friends with Dana, and uh, my position was, ""You're gonna give me the best seat in the house. I get to sit cage side for the fights."" I go, ""I'll do it."" And I wanted to help. I was like, ""I think these are the guys that we had always hoped for.""
TRUMP: He's an amazing guy.
ROGAN: In the early days of the sport, I started working for the company in 1997, I was before the UFC was purchased by Zuffa, which Dana worked for.
TRUMP: Oh, wow. Wow.
ROGAN: So I was a part of the previous owners, and I only did it for a couple of years. It was just too much and I was losing money. And it was banned from cable because of uh, Budweiser and John McCain, and you could only get it on Direct TV. And so—
TRUMP: And then I came along and I gave him the sites.
ROGAN: You did. And he loves you for that.
TRUMP: And he never forgot it.
ROGAN: He loves you for that. He talks about it all the time.
TRUMP: Just to interrupt you for one sec. So, they couldn't get a site because it was too dangerous and everybody was against it and they couldn't get licensed. And I gave him the first two or three sites. And they were great. And by the way, I went to the first fight. I said, ""I never saw anything like this."" It was crazy. It was so good. Take the best fight you've ever—It was like that fight. It was so good that I gave it to him again, and again. And all of a sudden it caught on.
But you know, when I wasn't in vogue, I've had time, you probably never had a time, but I had times when I wasn't exactly in vogue. Dana, they called him, he said, ""He's the greatest guy. There's nobody like him."" He said, ""I'll never say anything bad about that guy because when I needed—"" Because they were having a hard time at the beginning, they almost pulled the plug a couple of times, right? He said, ""He stood up and he gave us stuff that nobody else gave us, and nobody wanted anything to do."" And he said, ""I will never—"" And there was a time where it would've been very popular for him to say bad stuff about me. He said the greatest stuff about me. He said, ""You're gonna try and get me to say bad stuff about Trump but I'm never doing it."" So he's—
ROGAN: He's a very, very, very loyal guy.
TRUMP: An unusual guy.
ROGAN: Very unusual guy.
TRUMP: He's a fantastic guy.
ROGAN: A perfect guy to be at the helm of something so controversial as the UFC.
TRUMP: Less controversial, I mean, now certainly.
ROGAN: Well, now it's huge. Well, this was always the thing that I would hope that it would be. I always knew that it was unbelievably entertaining, but I just didn't know if maybe I was crazy. Maybe I loved it because I've had this long history of being involved in martial arts and maybe like other people who just think it's too violent. But—
TRUMP: Can boxing make it?
ROGAN: Yeah. Boxing's still a great sport. I love boxing.
TRUMP: But it seems to be—so unimportant now by comparison to UFC, don't you think?
ROGAN: I think—Well, you know, Dana is working with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They're, they're gonna start promoting boxing now.
TRUMP: [inaudible].
ROGAN: And with Dana at the helm of it, I think boxing could return, because the thing is, they want to make fights that other peop—maybe other promoters don't want to make because they want to protect their fighter. Controversial fights where it's dangerous. You don't know, this guy could lose. And so the Saudis, they're smart. They just offer a tremendous amount of money, and they're putting together fighters, fights that no one else can put together. They're doing that in boxing.
TRUMP: If Dana's involved, he'll probably make it good.
ROGAN: He'll make it good.
TRUMP: The amazing thing though, the, the, in fighting, no UFC fighter they say has ever died, and it looks to me much more violent than boxing. Many boxers have died. Isn't it interesting? And Dana tells me because they take so many shots to the face.
ROGAN: Yes and there's also no other options to preserve yourself, to protect yourself. So if you get hit in a UFC fight, you can clinch, you can try to take the fight to the ground. You got options. Also, you don't get allowed to get knocked down and then get back up. When you get knocked down, you're concussed. And generally, if a guy's really hurt, they could be finished in, on the ground and the fight's over. If it's boxing, you have 10 seconds to get up. You get up, your head kind of clears, but you're still in real bad trouble, and then you can run away and survive until the bell rings. They're only three minute rounds, and then you start again. So you're getting repeated punishment to the head.
And then there's also the issue of guys weight cutting, which is a problem with the UFC as well. But weight cutting and boxing has led to—if you look at deaths in boxing, there's very few of them in the heavyweight division. Most of the deaths in boxing are the lighter weight divisions.
TRUMP: Wow, oh, that's interesting.
ROGAN: Because when guys dehydrate themselves to lose weight, to make weight, their brain is the last thing that gets rehydrated. like It's very difficult to completely rehydate, rehydrate your brain quickly. And you only have 24 hours between the weigh-in and the fight. And it used to be, the weigh-ins were the day of the fight. Like when ""Boom Boom"" Mancini had a fight with Duck Koo Kim and killed him in the ring, which is one of the last ones on television that we've seen—
TRUMP: That's right.
ROGAN: That was a crazy event for people and heartbreaking. And it led to a bunch of different changes. And one of them is day before weigh-ins to allow people to rehydrate better. And the other one is they dropped it from 15 rounds down to 12.
TRUMP: Which, look, they should do that. you know, I'm not, I'm not the fighter, but those 15 round fights were unbelievable.
ROGAN: They were unbelievable.
TRUMP: They were unbelievable. In terms of—
ROGAN: You go back to the golden age—
TRUMP: In terms of entertainment, those were the championship reps. Those were the greatest fights ever.
ROGAN: Those last three rounds were crazy.
TRUMP: That was brutal.
ROGAN: It's such a war of attrition. you know, A lot of people think even a five-round UFC fight, the, the UFC is five-minute rounds, it's so much energy you're burning out. And those last couple of rounds, those five round fights, the fourth and the fifth round, unbelievably brutal.
TRUMP: Who's the greatest UFC fighter, in your—are you allowed to say, in your opinion? It's tough for you to say because you do this, but who do you think is the greatest of the fighters?
ROGAN: There's, there's a lot of arguments for who's the greatest of all time. you know, Jon Jones, most people would say is the greatest of all time. Never lost. uh, It's, there's certainly a really good argument for that. There's another argument for Georges St-Pierre. I always leave in B.J. Penn in his prime, Anderson Silva in his prime. uh, Mighty Mouse, people forget about Mighty Mouse because unfortunately he's a smaller guy. He's a 125 pounds flyweight champion. He's one of the greatest expressions—
TRUMP: [inaudible].
ROGAN: Of mixed martial arts I've ever seen. I think to this day he's probably—
TRUMP: And Khabib. What about Khabib?
ROGAN: Khabib is fantastic. But if you looked at accomplishments in terms of championship fights, Khabib retired 29-0, but he didn't have as many world championship fights.
TRUMP: And probably never lost a round. They say he—
ROGAN: He might've lost to Gleison Tibau. He might've lost to him.
TRUMP: A round.
ROGAN: He might've lost a round. And that was a controversial fight where people think that Gleison Tibau could have even got the decision in that fight. I'd have to go back and watch it again to make a decision. But—
TRUMP: They're, great athletes, though.
ROGAN: Oh, the best athletes in the world, and the, the, the most dangerous sport in terms of like—I always call it high level problem solving with dire physical consequences.
TRUMP: Yes. It's just brutal.
ROGAN: That's what fighting is.
TRUMP: I'll never forget, so there was a fighter named James Toney.
ROGAN: Oh, yeah. I love James Toney. ""Lights Out.""
TRUMP: He fought as a very light fighter and he ended up as a heavyweight. This guy went through everything. He was almost like a lightweight.
ROGAN: He went from middleweight all the way up to heavyweight.
TRUMP: And, and, and, I've never seen that.
ROGAN: Even Evander Holyfield is a heavyweight.
TRUMP: And he was a real fighter.
ROGAN: Oh, yeah.
TRUMP: So James Toney and I think it was uh, St. George—
ROGAN: George St-Pierre.
TRUMP: St-Pierre. I think was him. Who did he fight? James Toney—
ROGAN: No, James Toney didn't fight Georges St-Pierre.
TRUMP: He fought a UFC fighter.
ROGAN: Yeah, Randy Couture fought James Toney.
TRUMP: Was it Randy Couture? Maybe.
ROGAN: That was an easy fight. That was a very easy fight. Randy Couture just took him down and strangled him.
TRUMP: It was the most—And he's half the size. And he just, once he got to the ankles—In fact, the announcer said, ""It's over."" And he put him to sleep.
ROGAN: He ankle picked him, took him down, mounted him, strangled him. It was pretty quick.
TRUMP: And James, he was a nice guy, but he was talking big because he was much bigger. He was a pretty big guy.
ROGAN: I think James just wanted to make some money in that fight.
TRUMP: You think so?
ROGAN: Yeah.
TRUMP: But I never forgot it.
ROGAN: [inaudible].
TRUMP: It was over very quickly. And he's lying, sleeping on the mat and he was talking, he was doing the Muhammad Ali stuff, but it didn't work out. But I remember—
ROGAN: He sold the fight.
TRUMP: Yeah, that was Couture probably, wasn't it?
ROGAN: Yeah, it was Couture. George never fought a boxer in an MMA fight. If he did, he would kill them. George—
TRUMP: Was he, was he one of the greatest?
ROGAN: Yes, unquestionably. The argument, there's a handful of guys you can make the argument is the greatest of all time. People forget about Anderson Silva. In his prime, he was unstoppable. But that's the thing is—
TRUMP: Anderson Silva.
ROGAN: And then there's Fedor Emelianenko who fought Pride. In his prime he was unstoppable. There's this—
TRUMP: And you have a couple now that are pretty good.
ROGAN: Yes. Oh, we've got so many now. Alex Pereira.
TRUMP: Correct.
ROGAN: There's an argument that he's the top pound for pound fighter in the world right now.
TRUMP: He's looking very good.
ROGAN: He's unbelievable. But it's like, fighters can only compete at that level for so many years. And so in my opinion, you have to judge them at their very peak. You can't judge them when they're hanging on and still fighting. You can't judge them when they're coming up. You got to judge them in that championship peak and that championship peak, there's a handful of guys that you would consider at the very top.
TRUMP: If they stopped a little bit sooner, some of them would've had—you know, There are a couple of that you just mentioned without mentioning names, if they stopped, they had the perfect—they were unbelievable. And then at a certain age, they start getting knocked out, right?
ROGAN: Yes, it's unfortunate. But the thing is, that same belief in themselves that lets them become a champion makes—
TRUMP: It's okay.
ROGAN: Them think that they can do it long past the time that they actually can.
TRUMP: Well, Anderson Silva was essentially unbeatable and then he lost a close one. Then all of a sudden he had—
ROGAN: No, he got knocked out. He got knocked out by Chris Weidman. He was kind of clowning in that fight famously. And Chris Weidman had a vicious left hook, knocked him out, and then they fought a second time and he broke his leg on Chris Weidman.
TRUMP: Right, that's right.
ROGAN: And after that fight, he was kind of never the same because that that leg break injury, which Conor McGregor had, there's quite a few fighters that—
TRUMP: That was a bad one.
ROGAN: Weidman actually wound up having the same injury, ironically. There's only been like four of these.
TRUMP: You're never the same because you can't kick.
ROGAN: You're never the same. Well, you can. Weidman is still kicking with that leg. You can but, psychologically, when you throw a kick and your leg snaps in half and you're in agony for a year, right, you have to get surgery, you have to get bolts and plates to keep your leg together, and then it takes forever for it to heal.
TRUMP: It always amazed me how the kicker—I mean, you have those cases—but the kicker will do tremendous damage to somebody's leg, but their leg doesn't seem to get damaged. Isn't it sort of amazing?
ROGAN: It does get damaged. It hurts.
TRUMP: More than you think.
ROGAN: Your shin, you, you, you shin gets very numb after a while. And guys that are really good kickers, they're kicking the thigh and they're kicking the calf.
TRUMP: They're kicking that.
ROGAN: They're kicking soft areas and they're slamming this hard numb shin. Their shin gets all these like micro fractures all over the shin and it calcifies.
TRUMP: Oh, wow.
ROGAN: These guys can kick baseball bats. You ever seen them break baseball bats with their shins?
TRUMP: I've never seen.
ROGAN: It's crazy. Some guys can do two baseball bats. Some will hold the baseball bat and they just kick right through them. But their shins almost get numb.
TRUMP: But see, I watch your enthusiasm now, right?
ROGAN: Yeah.
TRUMP: And it's like, that's why you're good at what—nobody does this better. Without the enthusiasm, forget it.
ROGAN: Well, it has to be authentic. The only reason why I do MMA commentary is because I am very interested in it for real. I don't have to manufacture it. I'm very interested. So I think that's why—
TRUMP: And you love going in there after the fight, and they're sweating all over you. They're slopping all over you. You're beautiful.
ROGAN: They bleed on me.
TRUMP: They're bleeding on—
ROGAN: Sometimes their nose is bleeding—
TRUMP: Does that bother you a little bit?
ROGAN: No.
TRUMP: Like two weeks ago when the guy was—I never saw it.
ROGAN: Khalil Rountree.
TRUMP: He—more stuff came out of his nose.
ROGAN: Yes. It was pretty nasty. But no, I'm very used to it. I just wanted him to be able to—
TRUMP: That's great.
ROGAN: —express himself.
TRUMP: You've done a great job.
ROGAN: Thank you.
TRUMP: You've done a great job.
ROGAN: So back to you and back to—what are you—and, first of all, I love this idea of you teaming up with Robert Kennedy, and I love this make America healthy again idea. Because there are chemicals and ingredients that are in our food that are illegal in other countries because they've been shown to be toxic. There's pesticides and herbicides and there's a lot of shit that's been sprayed on our food that really is unnecessary. And there's a lot of health consequences that people are suffering from a lot of these things.
TRUMP: I brought this chart for you.
ROGAN: Beautiful.
TRUMP: Because I had a feeling you'd be asking me.
ROGAN: Thank you.
TRUMP: Look at this chart. These are healthier countries. Look where the United States is. I'm gonna send this to R.F.K Jr. Look at that.
ROGAN: So this is—well, something along the lines—I was actually talking to R.F.K today and he told me that more than 70% of young men are ineligible for the military because of their health.
TRUMP: I could see it. A lot of it's—
ROGAN: That's crazy.
TRUMP: A lot of it's obesity.
ROGAN: So here's the life expectancy versus health expenditure.
TRUMP: Same chart. Did you see that?
ROGAN: USA.
TRUMP: Wow, that's pretty good. Jamie's the best.
He's very good.
ROGAN: He's the best.
TRUMP: No, but look at that. Look where the USA is.
ROGAN: It's not good. And that's our food. That's our diet. That's sedentary lifestyle. That's our diet. That's the chemicals we ingest. That's what that is.
TRUMP: But R.F.K is gonna be very—you know, I think he's a great guy. I think he's great.
ROGAN: I love the fact that you guys teamed up. And are you guys, are you completely—
TRUMP: It's a good combination.
ROGAN: —committed to have him a part of your Administration?
TRUMP: Oh, I am. But the only thing I want to be a little careful about with him is the environmental, because you know, he doesn't like oil. I love oil and gas. I think you know, it's—
ROGAN: Just keep him out of that.
TRUMP: —the fire. So I'm gonna keep him out of a little. I said, ""Focus on health, focus, you can do whatever you want."" But I uh, got to be a little bit careful with the liquid gold, you know.
ROGAN: I understand. But listen, there's plenty of good work that could be done if you focus on health.
TRUMP: Here's the one, here's the one that my all-time favorite though.
ROGAN: What is that?
TRUMP: See the arrow right here. That's when I left. The day I left.
ROGAN: Do you have anyone that is pressuring you to not work with him? Have there been people that have reached—
TRUMP: To not work with who?
ROGAN: R.F.K. Jr.
TRUMP: Yes.
ROGAN: Yes? I would imagine. Because financially he could put a dent—
TRUMP: I would say that—and you know, I think in many ways they've done a good job, in many ways they've done a bad job. But I would say that the uh, big pharma wasn't thrilled when they heard that, you know I have a—I've actually always gotten along very well with him. I've known him a long time. He's a different kind of a guy. He's very smart, great guy, and he's very sincere about this. I mean, he really is. He thinks we spend a fortune on pesticides, on all this stuff, and then you end up at—that chart is a terrible chart, the one previous. It's such a bad chart when you look at where we are compared to other countries that don't spend 10 cents. So, and you save a lot of money. But yeah, we've, I've had some people that aren't exactly thrilled. You can imagine, right?
ROGAN: Sure.
TRUMP: It's a good question actually.
ROGAN: Well, uh, certainly if there have been—
TRUMP: It doesn't affect me.
ROGAN:—some pharmaceutical drugs that have been prescribed that have negative consequences that these people have been profiting off of, and then you have a guy, RFK Junior, who spends an enormous amount of time highlighting those things, you could see how they'd be very reluctant to have you support him.
TRUMP: I would say that's an understatement, yes.
ROGAN: Yeah. So what do you do to stop that from getting in the way?
TRUMP: Well look, they've come up with some amazing things. I mean, I don't know how you feel. I know you're against the vaccines, certain vaccines. But like the polio vaccine, people had polio, they were, it was like a disaster. And they came up, Dr. Salk, and he came up with a vaccine, and there's no polio. Now, uh, very interesting there hasn't been polio, but now in the Gaza Strip—can you believe that? Have you heard that? There's been a big strain of polio coming out in the Gaza Strip?
ROGAN: Is it vaccine-derived polio? Because there's a strain of polio that comes directly from the vaccine. Because unfortunately, sometimes when you vaccinate—
TRUMP: I don't know.
ROGAN:—people for polio, you have to give them polio.
TRUMP: Oh, I see. See, I haven't heard that. Yeah.
ROGAN: Yeah.
TRUMP: I mean, all I can do is I sit down and I listen to him, and—and I'll give it total—I would love him to be right, because it's, if he's right, it's a lot less expensive, generally speaking.
ROGAN: There's two things that people point to when they point to uh, the dangers of uh, the pharmaceutical drug industry. One thing is when pharmaceutical drugs were allowed to advertise on television. We're only one of two countries in the world that allow pharmaceutical drugs to advertise on TV. The other one's New Zealand, but they're more restrictive than we are. People are worried—
TRUMP: But those ads, when you hear, you know, ""Take a certain drug""—
ROGAN: And then you hear all the consequences.
TRUMP:—and then you say, ""It causes cancer and baldness,"" we don't like baldness here.
ROGAN: Suicidal ideation.
TRUMP: And this, and that, and eyesight, and you can lose your vision. And you know, I actually asked one of these guys, ""I would never take—"" I mean, it causes things that are so bad, they go through a whole list. I guess they save some liability, but, man. I said, ""Does that affect the purchase?"" They say it really does. When they, there's something you have and you read, and then they go through the list of—
ROGAN: Side effects.
TRUMP:—the potential side—it's not even—the potential side effects. I mean, a lot of people are just—I asked that question. People hear that. When I hear it, I, I am gonna take a pass. It says, ""May affect your vision, may cause blindness, may this—""
ROGAN: Yes. Well, I know you're aware of Calley and Casey Means, right?
TRUMP: Yes.
ROGAN: Well, one of the things that they pointed out, and this is a very important thing for people to understand, is what a lot of these drugs do is they, they act to somehow or another mitigate the effects of poor metabolic health. But most of these problems that these people are suffering from wouldn't exist if we put an emphasis on metabolic health. If people got healthier, they started eating nutritious food, taking vitamins, a whole host of these problems that people are having would go away. And the problem with that from the pharmaceutical drug standpoint is they wouldn't be able to sell drugs to these people. And this is a fear that a lot of people have.
TRUMP: And the pesticides and things like that on the plants. What do you think of that?
ROGAN: It's terrible. Well, I think regenerative agriculture, unfortunately, is very difficult to scale to a point where you got a Jack-in-the-Box on every corner.
TRUMP: Right. That's right. That's right.
ROGAN: If everybody wants food, and we have food deserts, and we have places like Los Angeles where no one's growing anything and everything has to be shipped in, it's very difficult to feed that many people. We've created this incredible society where we have these enormous cities, but it's very difficult to get food to these people. And then for a lot of these people in low-income areas, the only food that's available is cheap, unhealthy food. And we could fix that. That, that's—if we could send $175 billion to Ukraine, we could do something to fix a lot of the health problems that the United States has. And I think it would hur—help us as a nation overall, if you just put it out there that, ""Hey, as a nation, we're gonna make a concerted effort to get people healthier."" Just put it out there and people start making better choices.
TRUMP: Well, when you look at that chart, I was—
ROGAN: It's crazy.
TRUMP: They just gave me that chart because they said, ""You may want to discuss this topic,"" which I know is a big topic for you. And when I looked at that chart and I looked at how unhealthy we are as a nation, that's a pretty big thing.
ROGAN: How are you so healthy? Is it golf?
TRUMP: No, it's genetics, I believe. I'm a big believer—
ROGAN: Genetics is a big factor.
TRUMP: I really am. My father, uh, was, he was an old guy—
ROGAN: Unfortunately, it is a big factor for health. Some people are just way more robust. But you do play golf a lot, and that is exercise.
TRUMP: Both of my parents—it, it, for me, it's good.
ROGAN: Fresh air—
TRUMP: It really is. It's fresh air—
ROGAN:—exercise,
TRUMP:—you're outside. Even mentally, you are focused on that three-footer, and for a couple of hours you're not—And I go quick. I play fast, real fast, and I'm in, I'm out. But you know, it gives me—I was never one that could run on a treadmill, and I just, I can do it. When passing a physical, they asked me to run on a treadmill, and then they make it steeper, and steeper, and steeper. And the doctor said, it was at Walter Reed, they said, ""It's unbelievable."" I couldda gone, I'm telling you, I felt I could have gone all day. But I said, ""Doc, I can do this all day long. I'm not, I have no problem."" But it's boring to me, do you understand?
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: It's just boring.
ROGAN: Golf's exciting.
TRUMP: But I did it for so long, they couldn't believe it, that I did it. And I never did, I don't do it, I don't really—I have friends that run on this stuff all day long. But I had no problem doing it, but it's really boring. So with golf or something, or tennis, or whatever, but golf, as you get older, there's something really good about it. And you have competition with your friends, you know, there's something—
ROGAN: Competition, concentration, focus.
TRUMP: And it's a great handicap sport.
ROGAN: And it's also a thing, I think, uh, it cleans your mind because when you're looking at a shot, that's all you can think of, when you're executing.
TRUMP: It gives you a couple of hours. you know, It's interesting, with tennis, if you're much better than somebody, you can't really play with somebody. you know, It doesn't work. You can give them the equivalent of strokes, right, but it's not the same. With golf, you can play with a lousy guy and give him a stroke a hole or two strokes a hole or something. It's a good handicapping sport.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: But it gives me a little exercise. But I haven't played uh, in a long time. I won 32 club championships, can you believe it?
ROGAN: Didn't you play right after you got shot?
TRUMP: uh, No. What I did is I played with Bryson DeChambeau. Do you know Bryson?
ROGAN: Yes.
TRUMP: The pro. He's a great player. And we played, it was a certain thing that we played, I guess called breaking 50 or something. 50, we play from a certain tee, and if you can break 50—And it got tremendous ratings, it was sort of like a crazy thing. He's a great guy. He's a great—
ROGAN: But wasn't that a couple of days after you got shot?
TRUMP: I don't know. I know I haven't—
ROGAN: That was one of the funniest things, you were on the golf course.
TRUMP: I may have. I think I did. Yeah, maybe I did. But you know, I view it very interestingly. I'm running for President of the United States, to me, it's such a big deal. It's so important. So I've got now—
ROGAN: Well, it's the biggest deal in the free world?
TRUMP: It's 100 times bigger than the Super Bowl, and it's one person. So you're down to two people, and we start off at nine billion, because you have nine billion, they say, in the world. Who knows what that number is? But you get down to 350 million. Sadly, we have no idea what we have in this country, but let's assume it's 325, 350. And you're down to two people. It's the biggest thing in the world. And when I heard she took off yesterday, and she took off the day before, and she's gonna take off tomorrow or the next day—I haven't taken a day off in 56 days. That's a long time. I haven't taken one day off. I didn't, I don't want to play golf, this is too exciting. Golf is great, but this is too exciting. This is more exciting than anything you can do. And the thing is—
ROGAN: Also, it's the homestretch.
TRUMP: It's the homestretch. Who would take a day off? So we have 11 days left now, and, think of it, so I think I've gone 54, 55 days in a row, no days off. And I make speeches oftentimes, you know, sometimes not, but I make speeches. And when you make a speech—and my speeches last a long time because of the weave, I mean I weave stories it, and if you don't, if you just read a teleprompter, nobody's gonna be very excited. You got to weave it out. But as you say, you always have to get right back to what—Otherwise it's no good. But the weave is very, very important. Very few weavers around. But it's a big strain on your—you know, It's a lot of work. It's a lot of work. uh, You gotta be careful with the voice. You can lose that voice. The voice wasn't designed—I said today—
So, I made a big one last night. I was in Las Vegas, a big one the night before in Arizona, big one. I mean, they're all big. We have the—there's never been anything like it in terms of crowds. Never been close. Never been close. They say, ""He talks about crowd size."" You know what's very interesting? So we get crowds that are really big. And I say, ""You know, I've never had a story—"" Because I don't get good press. I don't think I've had a good story in years. I really don't. I don't, I swear, I don't think I—You were talking about it a little bit with Oprah how everybody loved me. I don't think, I became President of the United State, I did great the second time, I did much better. I don't want to get you in any disputes, but I won that second election so easy. And not just because of—
ROGAN: But let me get to that.
TRUMP: But wait.
ROGAN: I want to talk to you about that.
TRUMP: But here's the thing. I did that and now I've gotten the nomination again. And don't forget to get these nominations, you go against very smart people. Ron DeSantis was hot, gotta go through him. Nikki Haley was hot, had to go through her. I went through everybody, record time, right? Record time. I got three nominations in a row, uh, won the first time, did much better the second time. you know, I get millions of votes more the second time. And now I'm doing it a third time. And, and it's an incredible thing, I never get a good story. I only get bad press. Now, I will say this, it's a lot easier if you're a Democrat. If I were a Democrat—
ROGAN: You'd get a lot of positive press.
TRUMP: I would get a lot of positive press.
ROGAN: Yeah, no, it's a creepy, corrupt business. And the, the media, to a large extent, acts as a propaganda arm for the Democratic Party.
TRUMP: It's not even believable.
ROGAN: Yeah. It's believ—it's bizarre to watch. And most, most young people I think are aware of it. I think most boomers still unfortunately read the newspapers and believe in CNN.
TRUMP: But it's getting younger. Let me tell you. It's getting for us, for a conservative—And I don't even—
ROGAN: But you know why that is?
TRUMP: I consider myself a person—
ROGAN: It's the internet.
TRUMP: I think so.
ROGAN: It's because the internet's giving people information that they're not getting from anywhere else. And like the ""Very fine people"" hoax, the Russiagate hoax, all these different things that they've done, they tried to pin on you, it's a clear distortion of what you actually said.
TRUMP: The bloodbath hoax.
ROGAN: Yes.
TRUMP: I was talking about the auto industry. It's a bloodbath because Japan and China are taking our auto. And I said, ""It's a bloodbath."" They said, ""Ah, he used the word ""bloodbath."" You know, you'd think if somebody—
ROGAN: You said if you don't win, it's gonna be a bloodbath because they're gonna take over.
TRUMP: That's right. That's right.
ROGAN: That's exactly what you said.
TRUMP: It's a terrible thing they do.
ROGAN: But that's the problem with propagandists, because they take things out of context. And ultimately what they do is they diminish their own credibility because people don't want to listen to them anymore, because they see that they've done that, and they recognize what's going on, and they feel insulted. Their intelligence is getting insulted.
TRUMP: Well look at the ratings. Shows like yours—So I have a son who's very smart and tall, Baron. Right? And he knows all about you. He knows about guys I never heard of. He said, ""Dad, you don't know how big they are. They're big."" He was telling me how big. I said, ""Who the hell is he?"" Like Ross, I didn't—He said, ""Dad, he's a great guy."" I mean, guys that are doing—It's a whole new world out there.
ROGAN: It's a different world. And I think—
TRUMP: But I'm on TikTok now.
ROGAN: Congratulations.
TRUMP: And I've done really well. No, but you know the crazy? Have you seen the numbers? I've billions like billions of hits. It's crazy.
ROGAN: I'm sure. TikTok's a wild application though.
TRUMP: And I've gone up 30 points. A Republican is always down 30 with young people. I'm plus 30, and I'm on Tok, TikTok.
ROGAN: I think young people—
TRUMP: Its had a huge impact.
ROGAN: Young people are rejecting a lot of this woke bullshit.
TRUMP: Yeah, they are.
ROGAN: Young people are tired of being yelled at and scolded. They're tired of these people that they think are mentally ill telling them what the moral standards of society should be today. People are upset.
TRUMP: It's a big difference—there's a big difference now, even in just a couple of years—I was shaking hands with people. They're young people—
ROGAN: The rebels are Republicans now.
TRUMP: Yeah, I never thought about it that way. I think you're right.
ROGAN: They're like, ""You want to be a rebel? You want to be punk rock? You want to buck the system? You're a conservative now."" That's, that's how crazy. And then the liberals are now pro, pro silencing criticism. They're, they're pro censorship online. They're, they're talking about regulating free speech and regulating the First Amendment. It's bananas to watch.
TRUMP: Joe, they come after their political opponent.
ROGAN: Well, they do.
TRUMP: I got more guys—I always say, you know, I kid, but I'm not kidding. I've been investigated more than Alphonse Capone. He was the meanest of them all. He'd kill you in two seconds if he didn't like you, right? I've been under investigation more than Alphonse Capone only because it's political opponent stuff. And I've won. I won the big case in Florida. I'm winning the other stuff. You win. But you know what they did? They did something that's only done in Third World countries, they came after their political opponent.
ROGAN: Yes.
TRUMP: I could have put Crooked Hillary in jail.
ROGAN: Well, not only that, but then they're weaponizing it by saying that that's what you're going to do once you get in office.
TRUMP: Of course, yeah. Yeah, isn't it great?
ROGAN: Ignoring what they're doing right now. It's crazy.
TRUMP: I heard it, somebody was defending me today, says, ""No, that's—"" They say, ""That's what you're doing to him."" They're going, ""He's gonna put us in jail. He's gonna invest—""
ROGAN: That's what you're doing.
TRUMP: They said, ""That's what you're doing to him."" A lot of people say, ""Will you do that? Will you do that to him, to them if you win?"" The presidency has tremendous power. I could have put Crooked Hillary in jail.
ROGAN: I respected that you didn't.
TRUMP: I didn't.
ROGAN: Because what you said was, ""It would be bad for the country.""
TRUMP: No, I couldn't even imagine. You have, first of all, Secretary of State, but more importantly, the wife of the President of the United States of America going into jail. And if you ever saw, when I'd say something about her, they're all say—I didn't say it. I never said it. They say, ""Lock her up. Lock her up."" And I'd always go, ""Take it easy. Just relax. We're gonna win this thing. Take it easy. Take it easy."" And I'm telling you, I kept it down, just the opposite. Now they say, ""Oh, Trump wanted to put her in jail."" No, I saved her from going to jail. They had more stuff on her.
And Comey had it, because when Comey got up—and he stupidly, because he's a stupid guy too—he's a stupid son of a bitch. He got up, Joe, he got up, and instead of saying she's innocent of all charges, he went over each charge, and each charge was a killer. And he'd go, ""And as far as her doing this, she's innocent. And this—"" And then he said, ""Only an unfair prosecutor would go—"" But every time you heard these charges, they sounded so bad. They were bad. And all it was is he wanted more airtime. If you would've gone up and said, ""I've thoroughly investigated Hillary Clinton, and she's done nothing that we feel is wrong,"" it would've ended. Instead, he wanted to be up there because he's a, he's a PR hound. He's a hog. And he starts going through the—and you know what he had? They had a huge problem, because FBI is great, the people there. Not the top people, the people, the real people, the people that work there. It's like the real generals that I told you about that defeated ISIS in record time. The FBI guys are great. I'll bet you I'd be at 95% in the FBI.
ROGAN: I bet that's right.
TRUMP: Underneath—and, and so here's the thing. So he goes with Hillary, and instead of just saying, he goes through each charge.
ROGAN: Right, which looks damning. Yeah.
TRUMP: And even I would say, ""Man, those are bad charges."" And this is before I got—
ROGAN: Sounds terrible because it's associating her with those charges,
TRUMP: Don't forget, this is before I got there.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: Now, he was trying to protect her, but he did her a great disservice.
ROGAN: Because he wanted attention.
TRUMP: He was stupid.
ROGAN: So, I want to talk about 2020, because you said over and over again that you were robbed in 2020.
TRUMP: Yeah, totally.
ROGAN: How do you think you were robbed? Everybody always cuts you off. I'm gonna allow—
TRUMP: They do. Well, they not only cut you off. Well, what I'd rather do is we'll do it another time, and I would bring in papers that you would not believe. So many different papers. That election was so crooked. It was the most crooked election.
ROGAN: Okay, but give me some examples of how.
TRUMP: Well, let's start, let's start on the top and the easy ones.
ROGAN: Okay.
TRUMP: They were supposed to get legislative approval to do the things they did, and they didn't get it. In many cases, they didn't get it.
ROGAN: What things?
TRUMP: Anything. When they made—
ROGAN: Legislative approval of?
TRUMP: Like for extensions of the voting, for, for, for voting earlier, for this, all different things. By law, they had to get legislative approvals. You don't have to go any further than that. If you take a look at Wisconsin, uh, they virtually admitted that the election was rigged, robbed, and stolen. They wouldn't give access in certain areas to the ballots because the ballots weren't signed. They weren't originals. They were—we could go into this stuff. We could go into the ballots or we could go into the overall. I'll give you another one.
ROGAN: Are you gonna present this ever?
TRUMP: Well, let me—
ROGAN: Do you think like in a—
TRUMP: Let me just give you one more before.
ROGAN: Okay, go ahead.
TRUMP: 51 intelligence agents come up that the laptop was from Russia. It turned out to be totally false. It wasn't—
ROGAN: 51 former intelligence agents, right?
TRUMP: They say that made—I don't believe it's this much, but it doesn't matter. I won by like—I lost by—I didn't lose. But, they say I lost—Joe, they say I lost by 22,000 votes. That's like one 10th of 1% less than that. It's a tiny little thing. 22,000 votes, spread over, that's spread over this, this period. So 51 intelligence agents lied. They lied. They lied. They knew it was. It was Hunter's. It was from his bed. It was Hunter's laptop. They said it was created by Russia. Russia, Russia. Russia. It was the Russia hoax. The Russia hoax was a big hoax. It was all a big hoax. So they get more—
ROGAN: Well, that's clear. That's one example. That is a good example.
TRUMP: But that is a big example. They say it made a 17 point difference. That's a big example. But that's only one. And you could go into the ballots where they wouldn't give you access to the ballots. You could go into the ballot harvesting. You could go into $500 million for the lock boxes.
ROGAN: But just in terms of narrative, so there's two things. There's the Russia hoax, there's the collusion with Russia that was never proven. Right? That's one.
TRUMP: No, it was proven it didn't happen.
ROGAN: Right. Right, but they uh, they talked about it on television as if it was a—
TRUMP: But it took two and a half years to prove.
ROGAN: But not only that, but it was a constant narrative on television. That's a constant narrative that gets into people's minds, especially low-information people that just watch the news, that you're in collusion with Russia. So that's one. So that changes the narrative. And then you have the 51 former intelligence agents that work with the original Twitter and get them to remove links. You can't share it on DMs. You cannot share that story. They swept that story because they said it was Russian disinformation, even though they knew it was not.
TRUMP: 100%.
ROGAN: So that's two examples that are real examples. Now, anyone who considers himself a legitimate objective observer of American politics, if you really want the best person to win, you would want people to not lie. And the only reason why they got away with this lie was because they continually labeled you as this horrible threat to democracy, and Hitler. They kept saying you're gonna be a dictator, ignoring the fact that you weren't a dictator for the four years where you actually the President.
TRUMP: Correct, the opposite. I was actually the opposite of a dictator. I was a very straight guy. But look, those three things, you take those three things, each one of them by themselves causes the result to be different, okay?
ROGAN: It does.
TRUMP: And then you can go into 100 other things. There's so many. We can't have corrupt elections and we can't have open borders. We need, we need a—to have a country, you need borders, you need fair elections. And I'll tell you the other thing you need is you need a free and fair press. One of the things I like about doing a show like this, can you imagine Kamala doing this show?
ROGAN: I could imagine her doing the show.
TRUMP: She'd be laying on the floor—
ROGAN: I would try—she was supposed to do it, and she might still do it.
TRUMP: She wasn't gonna do it.
ROGAN: And I hope she does.
TRUMP: She's not going do it.
ROGAN: I will talk to her like a human being. I will try and have a conversation with her.
TRUMP: If she did this kind of an interview with you—I hope she does, because it would be a mess. She'd be laying on the floor, Kamala. You'd be saying, ""Call in the medics.""
ROGAN: I think we'd have a fine conversation. I think I'd be able to talk to her. I wouldn't try to interview her. I'd just try to have a conversation with her and hopefully get to know her as a human being. That was my goal having her on, trying to get her to express herself just as a—I don't know, I don't think these formats are good. I don't think that two people—First of all, I hate the idea of the Presidential debates because I hate the idea of a time limitation on complex ideas. Also, you have to break for—
TRUMP: I think you have to have the debates, though.
ROGAN: Right, but the way they do the debates I think is the wrong way to do it. I think they should have a conversation. I think you and Kamala, you sit across the table with no one in the room, but the two of you, of course you're not gonna shout at each other, of course you're not gonna insult each other.
TRUMP: Well, you may. I mean, it may get a little—They used to do it that way.
ROGAN: Yeah, but hopefully it wouldn't. But that would be the way to do it.
TRUMP: Yeah. They used to do it that way in the old days.
ROGAN: And just to put cameras on you with no, no one interfering with press—with checking whether or not it's factual, especially when it's biased. Because they checked you all those times and they didn't check her with clearly things that were inaccurate. Right? So have two people just have a conversation with each other without a time constraint. And also this idea they caught off the microphone when—
TRUMP: Well, and no crowd. How about no crowd?
ROGAN: No crowd. Crazy too, because you're good at working a crowd.
TRUMP: I would rather have a crowd.
ROGAN: Of course you would, you're good at crowds.
TRUMP: But I would rather, but I had no—So they gave me an alternative. I don't think he wanted the debate.
ROGAN: Why did they want no crowd? What was the argument?
TRUMP: Because I think they thought I wasn't gonna accept it. So I believe what they wanted to do is have me not accept. So they gave me a deal I couldn't refuse, and I said, ""I'll do it."" OK? It's like the mob. I'll take it. So they came to me, they said, ""We'll debate Joe Biden."" you know, That thing got tremendous ratings too. That was crazy. But, ""We'll debate Joe Biden, but you can't have a crowd."" They also wanted sitting down. I said, ""That's the only thing—"" I said, ""Look, you gotta, you got to stand up. You can't really sit down."" In the old days, they did sit down a little bit.
ROGAN: He gets tired.
TRUMP: But you got to stand up. And they agreed to it. It was a very tough thing, it almost killed it. They wanted to, they wanted to have desks, we sit. I said, ""I think we should stand up."" And that was the only thing I asked for. I said, ""We gotta stand up."" I, I thought it looked bad for like the public. But they said, ""No crowd, and cut off the mic."" And I said, ""I can live with it. I mean, I can live with it."" And they thought I was gonna reject it. And then they would say, ""He didn't want to debate Sleepy Joe."" That's what they thought was gonna happen.
ROGAN: Well, they tried to say that with you and Kamala as well. They tried to say that you didn't want to debate her as well. But that's—
TRUMP: No, by the way, with her, number one, I'm leading. Number two—you know, They also said it with the primary. So I had like 10, 12 guys in the primary. No stupid guys. I mean, they're governors and they're senators, they're not stupid people. Some are stupid, but not all of them. And all my guys said, ""You have to be in the debate. I said, ""Why? I'm leading by 74 points. The closest guy to me, I'm, I'm like 60 points, 70 points higher. Why would I stand there like an idiot for two hours and let every one of them scream at me? I'm gonna be the focus."" And I said, ""I'm not debating."" And it was a very smart thing because you know, it was, they just killed themselves.
ROGAN: The Republican primaries, yes.
TRUMP: Yeah, the Republican primaries. uh, I like debating. I think, I think you have to debate. But I like debating—
ROGAN: But it has to be fair.
TRUMP: I like debating like the Rosie O'Donnell debate. I like debating when you have a crowd. Remember that Rosie O'Donnell thing?
ROGAN: Yeah. It was very funny. Megyn Kelly.
TRUMP: It was crazy thing. Megyn. That was a hell of a question, man. If I didn't come up with that answer, I was done.
ROGAN: It was a great line.
TRUMP: Well, what it was is, you know, that is, we had 28,000 people. That was the Cleveland Arena where the Cavaliers played. LeBron James, I'm not a big fan of LeBron James, but he is a good basketball player. But, you know, and when I said that, the place went crazy.
ROGAN: Because it's funny.
TRUMP: And she's kept talking. No, she had 10 other—the names—
ROGAN: Yeah, well, Megyn said you said it to other people and you admitted you did. But it was funny. It was a comedic timing moment.
TRUMP: It was fine.
ROGAN: That's what they wanted to avoid.
TRUMP: It was lucky I did, it because she was drown—Oh, she wasn't finished, that question—but she kept talking, but you couldn't hear. To this day, they don't know what she said, but it wasn't positive. So anyway, but we had a good time. I think it's important.
ROGAN: But it's comedic timing, and that's the reason why to have a debate in front of a large audience. And then they probably thought you would stack the deck.
TRUMP: Well, how did I do with the Al Smith dinner?
ROGAN: It was great.
TRUMP: I got very good reviews on that.
ROGAN: That was great. Very funny.
TRUMP: I got good reviews.
ROGAN: Some very funny stuff. The Tim Walz stuff was very funny.
TRUMP: Tim Walz, yeah.
ROGAN: He's funny.
TRUMP: That's a real beauty.
ROGAN: That's a crazy one. She said that she had picked him, and this is one of the questions I want to ask her, when she was sleep-deprived. She said she was suffering from sleep deprivation when she picked him, which is just like, ""Hey, maybe take a nap.""
TRUMP: Okay, look, let's see how it all turns out. I think we're gonna win. I think we're way ahead now. I think we're way ahead. But, but—
ROGAN: Can I bring you back to 2020? Can I bring you back?
TRUMP: But if they lose, I think, I think they're gonna look at two things. They're gonna say they should have had a primary, even if it was a short primary, they shouldn't have picked her. And then she's gonna say, ""I shouldn't have picked this guy.""
ROGAN: She shouldn't have picked that guy.
TRUMP: That guy's a disaster.
ROGAN: Just the lying about Tiananmen Square—
TRUMP: Everything.
ROGAN:—admitting that. Yeah, the military record, assistant coach versus head coach.
TRUMP: But she lied too. She lied too.
ROGAN: Yes.
TRUMP: Little thing, so I did McDonald's last week.
ROGAN: I saw that.
TRUMP: And I actually got a call from your friends at Google, from Sundar. That's pretty good, right? He said, ""This is the biggest thing we've had in years,"" the hits.
ROGAN: You at McDonald's?
TRUMP: At McDonald's. Did you know that? It was one of the—
ROGAN: It was funny,
TRUMP: Who's a great guy, by the way. But he said, ""This McDonald's thing, I want to tell you, it's one of the biggest things we've ever had on Google."" It just hit. But the reason I did it, and I actually—You never know about this stuff. I thought it was a throwaway. I didn't think our conversation's a throwaway, but I thought that was. I thought I'd walk in. And that was only to highlight the fact—and I have a friend, he owns like 56 of these McDonald's, and he said, ""Do you want to use one?"" I said, ""Yeah, I love it."" So we went there and the crowd was crazy. you know, They had 28,000 people around the whole thing. Did you see the outside? It was crazy. The cars couldn't get through. Secret Service was not exactly thrilled. Had no idea what the hell—But I went into the place and I did the French fry thing, and it just hit. But that's like in life, sometimes you do—I thought it was like a quick throwaway, we're gonna be there for 15 minutes. Then I said, ""I've worked here for 15 minutes, which is 15 minutes more than she worked here."" She lied about McDonald's. And those—
ROGAN: Is that proven, that she never worked at McDonald's?
TRUMP: 100%. Well, McDonald's has no information. No—she has no information. There's nobody. The manager said she'd never worked there. you know, It was a certain place, and he said they never—No, she lied. She's a liar. You know what they do? They'll say like on any one of the questions, take any one, they'll say—It's the exact opposite of what I say. IVF, ""He's against IVF,"" the fertilization. And it's the exact opposite. I was, I came out immediately strongly in favor. And they do ads. I'm against it, it's wrong. uh, On every single topic. And you know, she changed policies on 15. I've never seen a guy change, anybody change on more than one. you know, You can maybe get away with one. Her whole life, fracking, every single thing that she was for, uh, the confiscation of guns. She wants to confiscate, now she's saying everybody should have a gun. In fact, we're gonna get her a MAGA cap. I'm gonna send her a MAGA cap. But she's changed, and I don't think people are buying it. I don't think people are buying it.
ROGAN: Well, some people are buying it because they want to buy it. Because it's blue, no matter who. There's a certain percentage of our population that's gonna vote Democrat no matter what.
TRUMP: That's true.
ROGAN: And they're pressured. There's their community, their ideology, it's left is good, right is evil.
TRUMP: You know what I don't understand? I don't understand why—Okay, you have a wall or you have a—You know, I built 570 miles a wall. Everyone said—I built a lot of wall, exactly the stuff. But you have a border. What I don't understand is who would want people to come into our country from places unknown. Like sometimes they'll say about a fighter, ""From parts unknown,"" right?
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: Remember Haystacks Calhoun, he says, ""From parts—
ROGAN: Yeah, the old days.
TRUMP: The old days. Those are the old days. That's even before you. But who would want people to come in, pouring into our country, we don't know anything about 'em?
ROGAN: But I want to ask you this. Why do you think they're doing that?
TRUMP: I think because—
ROGAN: Do you think they're trying to buy votes? Do you think they just want cheap labor? What's the idea?
TRUMP: Okay, it's a couple of theories. They hate our country; they're stupid; or they want to buy votes. It's one of those three things. They wanna—now, they are trying to get people registered who you know, don't even know what the country is.
ROGAN: And they're trying to give people amnesty. People that live here, they're trying to give them a path to citizen.
TRUMP: They want to give them amnesty, they want to give them citizenship. Well, how about what happened—
ROGAN: And if you think about the amount of money that they've given them when they've come here, the food stamps, the benefits that even our poor people aren't getting.
TRUMP: $200 billion, and that's a way low number, that's a way low. you know, It's interesting, New York has always been like sort of always like looking for money. They've spent $100 billion on this stuff. I don't know where they—And they're not getting the money from the federal government, it's crazy. And because the mayor came out and said, ""We can't live like this.""
ROGAN: They investigated him.
TRUMP: He got—by the way I called it, I said, ""He just got himself indicted."" This group is stupid, but they're vicious. They're stupid people, but they're vicious people.
ROGAN: The 2020 elections, you say you have all this evidence that it was rigged. Why haven't you put this evidence in a consumable form?
TRUMP: I did.
ROGAN: In what?
TRUMP: Oh, I did. I have books on it. And by the way, books have been written on it. We have an author named Hemingway who is a great writer, she wrote a book on it. But many books have been written on it. There are books that are—What's happened is judges don't wanna touch it. They would say, ""You don't have standing."" They didn't rule on the merits. They rule—the merits never got there. The judges didn't have what it took to turn over an election.
ROGAN: Let's talk about the potential vulnerabilities for elections and election fraud. One of them is mail-in ballots. The other one is the—if someone can break into voting machines, if someone can hack voting machines, those are two huge ones. And what can be done?
TRUMP: So Elon, Elon Musk, I think he said it public. I hope he did because I wouldn't want it to be the one to—but he's a really smart guy and he's a very good guy with computers, right? You'd say he speaks—
ROGAN: He's one of the smartest people alive.
TRUMP: Anybody that can land that 20 story building, and perfect and boom.
ROGAN: While he's doing Starlink, while he's doing Tesla, while he owns Twitter.
TRUMP: And then he agrees to Starlink and—
ROGAN: And Tweets 100 times a day.
TRUMP: He's an amazing guy, who—He said to me that unless you have paper ballots, it can never be an honest election. That's a big statement.
ROGAN: It's a big statement.
TRUMP: We should go to paper ballots. you know, France did. They went to mail-in voting and it was all messed up.
ROGAN: What can be done?
TRUMP: You know the amazing thing with the machines? So we have the machines, they cost 10 times more. A paper ballot would cost 8%, and they make paper ballots, they're all watermarked and everything else. They're very sophisticated. But if you take a look, paper ballots, 8% the cost, and you're done by nine o'clock in the evening, right? Now we have these sophisticated machine that goes up to heaven, it goes all over the place and down and around, and they say, ""We'll need two weeks to figure out who da hell won the election.
ROGAN: Do you think that's by design?
TRUMP: Yeah, I do. I think it's very crooked. That's my opinion.
ROGAN: You're allowed to have an opinion. What could—let's say you win in November. What can be done to mitigate these problems? What could be done at a, at the level that the President has power?
TRUMP: Well, if I win, that'll be, this will be my last election. But I think I owe it to the country.
ROGAN: It has to be.
TRUMP: But I think I owe it to the country, we have to have fair elections.
ROGAN: So how can you fix that?
TRUMP: Jimmy Carter was in charge of a commission, you know that, many years ago. And they put him and Scoop Jackson, and various Senators, distinguished people that were retired, and they came up with a report. And the report's primary finding was you cannot have mail-in ballots, because if it's a mail-in ballot—you know, I went to the voting booth the last time, whatever it was, and I walked in, in Palm Beach. And I walk in, and they know me. They say, ""Mr. President, could I see your identification?"" ""Yes."" Boom, here's this, here's that. Everything. And then you sit and they watch you sign, and, you really, there's not a lot you can do.
I mean, if you wanted to be dishonest, it's sort of beautiful. If instead of that I'm gonna send them a ballot, it has to go through the postal services. It has to go through a lot of people. They mail you, houses, that the house was demolished and the people have left. And, it, it's so bad. The one thing with Jimmy Carter, he had a very strong commission, it was no mail-in ballots. And we are the only one that does elections this way anymore, they've gotten away from them.
ROGAN: And it ticked up in a big way after COVID, it used to be like soldiers serving overseas.
TRUMP: They used COVID to cheat.
ROGAN: Yeah, well, they used COVID to certainly push this mail- in ballot. Another thing that—
TRUMP: But they used COVID to cheat. And the last election was a little bit of a, you couldn't even get security guys, big strong guys to watch. You know what, you'd call them. They'd call them and they'd say—they were afraid to go out. We were in the middle of COVID. We were in the middle of COVID, right smack in the middle, and they didn't want to die. you know, They didn't want to catch it. In a way, it was like a ghost town, and the whole thing—but mail-in ballots are a bad thing. Bad thing.
ROGAN: That, that certainly is a problem, mail-in ballots are a problem.
TRUMP: But every other country—
ROGAN: The other problem is voter ID.
TRUMP: Voted ID, how about—
ROGAN: Voter ID is the most bizarre argument that I've never seen anybody articulate in a way that's convincing why you don't need voter—
TRUMP: Because they want to cheat.
ROGAN: Well, it doesn't make sense any other way. I've tried to straw man it, or I tried to steal man it rather, I've tried to look at it from a position, like why would you want people to have ID? And a lot of the ideas are just ridiculous, you need an ID to get a driver's license.
TRUMP: Okay, but here's now the next step. Gavin Newscum [sic], one of the worst governors in the world, and I used to, frankly, I used to get along, but I don't get along with him because he's just too—It's just a whole con job. But Gavin Newscum [sic] the other day signed a bill that you are not allowed to ask a person, even ask them whether or not they have a voter ID.
ROGAN: Now what could be a charitable reason why anybody would want that?
TRUMP: Because they want to cheat.
ROGAN: But that would be the only thing that makes sense.
TRUMP: But that's taking it to the next level. Now, you have ID. The Democrat National Convention, when they had it the last time. I saw, they had a sign, like a billboard, the name of the person, where they live, how they live, who the hell their boyfriends are, every single, it was—and a big picture, that's for their, they have an ID, a big ID. It was hanging like you were a prisoner. It wa—they had these massive cards, everything. And yet when it comes to the vote, in theory, the most important thing we do, okay, when you go to a grocery store, you give ID. But for a vote, it's supposed to be a sacred thing. And it should be a sacred thing, no voter ID, because they want to cheat.
ROGAN: Well, it doesn't make sense in any other way. I've tried to look at it.
TRUMP: There's no other way.
ROGAN: There's no argument that anybody's presented that makes any sense why.
TRUMP: You know the funny thing, Joe, the Democrats, the people, they all think you should have it. In other words, you should have voter. If you go to the people, Mrs. Schwartz, Mrs. Smith, Mr. and Mrs. Jones. They say, ""Of course, yeah."" Democrats, they say yes. It's the politicians that don't want it, like Schumer and these guys, they don't want it. Because they want to be able to cheat, because you know what? If they didn't have it, okay, who is gonna vote for somebody that wants open borders? Who's gonna vote for somebody that wants to have uh, men playing in women's sports?
I have never had one person come up to me and say, ""President, you got to do something to allow men to play in women's sports."" Have you ever? It's like I've never been called by a pollster. I told you my little theory on pollsters. I'm getting myself in trouble with some of these things, but I don't really care. Nobody's ever come up to me and said, ""We want to have men play in women's sports."" And, you know, I had a funny thing at a property I own in California. I have a woman who's a very good athlete and she works there as a manager, and Brian Urlacher, the big uh, Chicago Bears, great player, you know, 10 time all star, I guess Hall of Fame, a great guy. Big strong guy. And she said, ""Oh, he's one of my favorite athletes. Can I have a picture?"" And I took a picture and I sent it. And I noticed she was the size of his leg, his leg was bigger than she was. And I put it out, ""Should men play in women's sport?"" The whole—it was just so ridiculous.
ROGAN: What's one of the most bizarre and polarizing ideas that's promoted by the left?
TRUMP: But who wants it? Now, unless you're gonna cheat in elections, you're never gonna get—Nobody wants it, I don't think anybody wants it. I've never—I've been told everything, some people want this. I don't know of anybody that wants open borders, nobody's ever come up to me and say, ""President, you've got to let the world come into our country."" Now, if they won, so they have 21 million. I think it's much higher than that because you've got a ways, got a ways where they just walk in. They walk in by—And the other thing you have is human traffickers. You have traffickers and the traffic in women, and they're going wild, now. You know where you have to look? The trunk of cars, can you believe it? They put women in trunks, they'll put three women in a trunk. These people are savages. They're horrible. The worst people, the hu—and the kind of money they make on drugs they're almost making on trafficking now.
And the thing that's made it hot is the internet. That's what, you know, you think of it almost as an ancient thing, but it's the internet. But who would want to have these things? Who would want to have—There's so many, the transgender operations, where they're allowed to take your child when he goes to school and turn them into a male, to a female without parental consent. Who wants this? Does anybody want this? I've never heard of anyone, and I can go into 10 different things. The only way they get 'em is by no voter ID. You can't have voter ID, they don't wanna, they want to cheat. There's only one reason, because the voter ID is so basic, it's the most basic thing.
ROGAN: It's very basic.
TRUMP: Who would want this? They want it so they can cheat, because their policies are no good. Their poli—I'll tell you, they're very smart when it comes to that, they're very smart. Although they're not smart in terms of uh, politics in a way, because what do they have that people want? They really don't have. They give away a lot of healthcare, a lot of stuff, but for the most part, their policies are terrible. Their policy on military, she's running on a tax hike. She's gonna raise your taxes. You gotta hear this. We are gonna raise your taxes, and the people clap. But who is gonna win with her? All my life I grew up with politicians—lower taxes. She's politic, she's politicking in that we are gonna raise your taxes.
ROGAN: Well, they wanna, the idea is you want to raise the taxes to the highest earners.
TRUMP: I know, but it really doesn't work out.
ROGAN: They think that millionaires and billionaires are not paying their fair share.
TRUMP: I know, but it doesn't work that way.
ROGAN: Well, it's a narrative, and it's a narrative that appeals to people that are not doing well. And they're like, ""Yeah, our problems are that these rich people are not paying taxes.""
TRUMP: Well, the problems are the rich people are gonna leave and they're gonna close up their companies, and then the other people aren't gonna have jobs. You know, that's what happens.
ROGAN: It does happen in other countries.
TRUMP: But, the whole—because you brought it up. I'll tell you what, we just, he's doing a very good job in Virginia, Glen Youngkin, I don't know if you like him, not like him.
ROGAN: I don't know him.
TRUMP: Oh, you don't know him, the governor of Virginia? So, we have a case where they found thousands of illegal ballots. A judge just ruled that they have to be able to vote. Just happened today. Just before I walked in here I heard. A judge just ruled that you have to keep those people in. They're illegal, they're illegal votes. Now, I think they'll be overturned at the next court. One thing I found, because I had a couple of things that they get overturned a little bit, the system. Because the system, you have to hope that the appellate judges are honest, otherwise we don't have a country anymore. It's very important. But the whole thing with the legal ballots, it's got to be looked at. You gotta have—you have to have voter ID and you have to have additional ID. You have to have an ID that shows that you're a citizen of the country.
ROGAN: I agree.
TRUMP: They don't want that either.
ROGAN: I agree. uh, One of the things that I wanted to talk to you about is the JFK files, and one of the things that you said was that if they showed you what they showed me, this is your quote, ""You wouldn't want people to know it either.""
TRUMP: uh, So I, I opened them up partially. I was met with, from good people. Look, I mean good people. People that were well-meaning, Mike Pompeo was one of them. He's a good person. uh, They called me, they said, ""Sarah would rather have you not."" After, and I did open 'em, but I was asked by some people not to open 'em. There's a Martin Luther King file too, by the way, that they'd like to see. I don't know if you know, but there is that. But, but JFK in particular. So they called me, a lot of good people called me. People that I, that you would find reasonable people, and they asked me not to do it. So I said, ""Well, we'll close it for another time."" But if I win, I'm gonna open them up, I'm just gonna open. Enough times.
ROGAN: Why didn't you open it up the first time though, what was the hesitation?
TRUMP: Addresses, people that are still living, there are people that are affected. uh, And there could be some national security reason that for, that I don't have to necessarily know about, but some very good talented people asked me not to do it. I opened it up, and then they said, ""Would it be possible for us to do that a different day?""
ROGAN: What, how much—much of it did you read into?
TRUMP: uh, I think it's gonna be just fine to open it, let me put it that way. I think it's fine. It's gonna be time. It's a cleansing, you know, it's really a cleansing. So I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it immediately, almost immediately upon entering office.
ROGAN: Well, the thing, when people look at it from the outside, and you sort of imagine what could be a reason why they would not release those files. It would be there's people that were implicated in the assassination.
TRUMP: Well, when there are living people, you generally tend not to want to do it, when people are still living.
ROGAN: Living people that formerly worked for the government.
TRUMP: For the government, and living people that were somehow involved in it. And you tend not to do that. But uh, it's time to open them. uh, I can't tell you whether or not they're gonna find anything of interest. And I did partially open, I think I've opened up 50%, but I was asked not to do it. And I, I thought that was a reasonable ask, but now I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it very soon. There's a lot of interest in it. There's a lot of interest in the people coming from space, you know.
ROGAN: Yes.
TRUMP: And I know you're interested in that too.
ROGAN: Oh, I'm very interested in that. How much did they tell you about that?
TRUMP: A lot.
ROGAN: Really?
TRUMP: Yeah.
ROGAN: What'd they tell you? How much can you tell? How's that work? Is it super top secret?
TRUMP: I can tell.
ROGAN: Tell me.
TRUMP: Well, based on Hunter Biden, I can say whatever the hell I want. But, no—but I interviewed a few people. It's never been my thing, I have to be honest. I have never been a believer. I have people that, Area 51 or whatever it is, I think it's the number one tourist attraction in the whole country or something. Area 51, in Las Vegas—do you know that, right?
ROGAN: Sure, I know what it is.
TRUMP: So, anyway, but it's a big tourist thing. So I interviewed jet pilots that say they saw something. If you saw them, you'd love to have them in your studio.
ROGAN: I've had a couple in here, Commander David Fravor, I had him in who had that sighting in 2004. Very, very compelling, with visual video evidence, radar evidence. Ryan Graves.
TRUMP: I don't believe his name, but I interviewed jet pilots that uh, were solid people, perfect. I mean, great pilots, great everything. And they said, ""We saw things, Sir, that were, were very strange. Like a round ball, but it wasn't a comet or a meteor, it was something. And it was going four times faster than an F-22,"" which is a very fast plane, you know. And it was round, uh, which is in theory a great shape.
ROGAN: So when you were talking to these people, was this something that you were compelled to have conversations about?
TRUMP: No.
ROGAN: Was this your personal interest?
TRUMP: A little bit. It's not a great interest for me, but it's a little interest. I get that question as much as almost any question, do you think that we have aliens coming, you know, flying around or whatever?
ROGAN: What do you think?
TRUMP: There's no reason not to. I mean, there's no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don't have life. you know,
ROGAN: Well, Mars, we've had probes there and rovers, and I don't think there's any life there.
TRUMP: Well, maybe it's life that we don't know, but maybe it's a different kind of life.
ROGAN: Well, maybe there was life there at one point in time. This is a speculation about Mars, that Mars had an atmosphere at one point in time, a long time ago, that could support life. It also had large bodies of water, but we've had no evidence of even bacterial life that exists on Mars. But the universe is pretty vast.
TRUMP: It's not been a big thing for me. When I looked at what China did to this admin—they would've never done it with me, where they put the balloon up. And a lot of people thought, a lot of people thought for a little while that that was one of these things.
ROGAN: Well, that's a lot of the speculation too, that some of these drones that hover over battleships, that these are Chinese drones and that they're not UFOs.
TRUMP: They could be also.
ROGAN: There's some super sophisticated—
TRUMP: But I did interview, let's say three or four guys, that, and without tremendous interest, if you had them, as I said, you'd love to have them as your children. Solid beautiful people. They said, ""Sir, there's something there.""
ROGAN: There's something there. Yeah, I've talked to quite a few of them.
TRUMP: They're not conspiracy guys.
ROGAN: Well, just the Commander David Fravor thing in 2004 off the coast of San Diego, they clocked that thing going from 50,000 feet above sea level to 50 in a second. They don't know what it is.
TRUMP: That's tough to beat.
ROGAN: Yeah, they saw something in the water, it was hovering over that something that was making a disturbance in the water. They got video evidence of this thing. Two different fighter jets with pilots in them saw it. There's you know, visual evidence, photographic evidence, video evidence, radar evidence, whatever the hell it is, it moves in a way that would turn a human being into Jello if they're inside of it. The G-Force, no one would survive. It's like, what is that? And it doesn't have a heat signature, they don't know what their propulsion system was. But—
TRUMP: When you fly in some of these jets, these pilots have to be in great shape.
ROGAN: Oh yeah, I flew with the Blue Angels once. Yeah, I got to fly. I guess it's an F/A-18.
TRUMP: And those are older machines.
ROGAN: And they're crazy.
TRUMP: When you fly in some of these things, it's amazing.
ROGAN: Oh my God. Yeah, I can imagine.
TRUMP: But you got to be special.
ROGAN: But these things that these people are in encountering are far superior to what we know of. Is it possible that there's some military or government program that you weren't, that they didn't tell you about?
TRUMP: I think, I think I had a great relationship with the military basically, but you know, I didn't like certain people. I would've gotten them out if I thought—if I were—if the election was different, I would've fired you know, all of them quickly. Some, most of them I did fire. Biden should have fired every military person involved with Afghanistan, he should have had a lot of firings. you know, If you look at him, he told Israel not to do anything, and at least Israel's not gonna look at it in a bomb the way they would've been. I think if they listened to Biden, they'd be waiting for a bomb to drop on their head right now. He's been wrong about so much. I guess you'd have to say that she's been wrong too, because you know, they said, she always said they made the decision together. But uh, Israel didn't follow his advice, and I think it was a, uh, I think—and the Middle East is rapidly changing.
you know, There are Prophets that say the world will come to an end in the Middle East, you know that, right? And we have weapons today that are so scary when you look, I rebuilt them all. And when you look at the weapons we have today, the biggest threat we have in the world today is nuclear weapons. And we have other weapons too that are devastating, but the nuclear weapons, the biggest threat we have in the world today. And that's what—you—I was talking about de-escalation with both China and Russia. I'm telling you, we were gonna de-escalate, they were gonna de-escalate. You got to be careful, it's a little tricky playing with them. Because they say, ""We're gonna do it,"" and they don't do it, maybe. But they understood the curse too, it's a curse. It, uh, China's way behind us, but they'll catch us within five years.
ROGAN: So let's imagine, let's, let's say you win in November. What do you do differently and how do you change this course that it seems we are on for World War III? How do you get us out of Ukraine? How do you stop what's going on in the Middle East? How do you put a stop to this?
TRUMP: Well, it's a very, uh, to me it's an easy question, because I think I can do it easily, but it's a complex question in the sense that the times change, every day changes. uh, Who's winning, who's not winning? I mean, Russia's a war machine, whether you like it or not, it just grinds along, grinds along. You speak to people like Viktor Orban, he'll tell you, it's just a big fat war machine, and that's what's happening. You look at what's happened to Ukraine, if I were there, it would've never happened.
ROGAN: But you, what could you do now, if you get into office in January, what could you do now?
TRUMP: Right now, right now, right now, you would get both of them. I know both very well. And, and again, I cannot, I do not want to tell you for the purpose of looking smart to five people that you know, say, ""Oh, he was great."" Because if I told you exactly what I'd do, I could, I could never make the deal. All I can tell you is that I would meet with Putin and I would meet with him, and I know exactly what I'd say to each one of them. And I believe that as President-elect, I would get that war stopped and stopped fast. you know, We have tremendous power in the United States if you know how to use the power. I stopped other wars just by the use of tariffs. I got Macron of France, good guys, like a friend of mine, but he's a wise guy. And he's a person that likes France, and he was gonna tax our companies. And I say, I sent all the smartest guys. I sent Mnuchin, they all failed me. And I said, ""I'll do it myself.""
And I called him, I said, ""Emmanuel, you're taxing American companies. We're not gonna allow you to do that."" ""Oh, Donald, I cannot do—nothing I could do. It's already been passed."" I said, ""Emmanuel, if you do that, I'm gonna put 100% tariff on your wines and champagnes that come in to the United States, and you're gonna regret that you ever did it."" He said, ""Donald, please, that's not fair."" Anyway, within about two minutes he dropped the whole thing, and it was massive amounts of money against American companies. I have to protect American companies.
ROGAN: So why doesn't the Biden Administration do this?
TRUMP: Because they're incompetent, they don't know how to talk. Look, they met in Alaska with uh, the Chinese, and the Chinese lectured them about how badly we treat people. Right? Okay, think of it. You remember that day? It was like in a—they didn't talk to me that way. They never—they respected me. They respected our country. They don't respect our country. They don't respect Biden, they don't respect her. They're dreaming about her because she's incompetent. She's not a smart person. Look, she can't put two sentences together. She talks, I watched her two nights. I watched her last night too, it was the same thing. She's not a smart person. These guys are very smart and they're very streetwise, and they're very tricky and evil and dangerous. And if she becomes the President of the United States, which I can't believe can happen, I don't think this country is gonna make it. I don't think we'll ever be—I think, I think just really bad things will happen to our country.
And you know what? I look at the outside forces and I say they can all be handled, because we have a pot of gold, but we're not gonna have that pot of gold to play with anymore. you know, It's a great negotiating thing. I told you, I knocked out this massive car company, gonna take all of our car business from Detroit. I knocked it out just by my rhetoric, rhetorically I said, ""They'll never sell a car in here. I'll put tariffs. I don't care they're 2000%, they're never gonna build that plant.""
ROGAN: Is it possible to apply that same thing to the electronics that we use?
TRUMP: Yeah.
ROGAN: One of the things that disturbs me greatly is that all of our phones are made overseas, and then some of our phones are made in places like—
TRUMP: And the chips.
ROGAN: Yes, and the chips. And some of our phones are made in places like Foxconn, where they have nets around the building to keep people from jumping off the roof because they have so many suicides. LIKE Wouldn't it be better to have an American made iPhone, where you know people are paid good wages, they have health insurance, they're taken care of, they can live a good life. Where you're not buying a piece of electronics that's cheaper because someone has to suffer horrible, in a horrible way that's not even legal in the United States. It's not even legal to have them work that way in the United States, so they get these people to build them overseas.
TRUMP: You do it, but let me just say, that chip deal is so bad. We put up billions of dollars for rich companies to come in and borrow the money and build chip companies here, and they're not gonna give us the good companies anyway. All you had to do is charge them tariffs. If you would've put a tariff on the chips coming in, you would've been able to, just like the auto companies, no different. More sophisticated, but no different. you know, Taiwan, they stole our chip business. Okay? They want us to protect and they want protection, they don't pay us money for the protection, you know. The mob makes you pay money, right? But with these countries that we protect, I got hundreds of billions of dollars from NATO countries that were never paying us. And my biggest fan is Stoltenberg, who just left as the Director General, as a Secretary General, good guy.
He said, ""Bush came, he made a speech. Obama came, he made a speech. Trump came, he said, you guys aren't paying. You gotta pay."" And they said, ""Will you protect us from Russia if we don't?"" I said, ""No, you got to pay. If you don't pay—"" Billions of dollars came in to NATO. When I see us paying a lot of money to have people build chips, that's not the way. You didn't have to put up 10 cents, you could have done it with a series of tariffs. In other words, you tariff it so high that they will come and build their chip companies for nothing. In other words, Joe, you put a big tariff on the chips coming in. I say, ""You don't have to pay the tariff, all you have to do is build your plant in the United States."" We didn't have to give them the money to build the plant, besides that, they're very rich companies. These chip companies, they stole. They stole 95% of our business, it's in Taiwan right now.
They do a great job, but that's only because we have stupid politicians. We lost the chip business, and now we think we're gonna pay. You can't build it that way. You have to make them spend their money in the United States, and those plants would open up all over. And they'll fund them, we don't have to put up 10 cents. I am in the process of making a huge speech in about a little while, and you and I, how long have we been talking?
ROGAN: A long time.
TRUMP: Let's go.
ROGAN: Probably like three hours.
TRUMP: I got to make a speech, but we'll do it again. I want to do it again with you. You are something.
ROGAN: Thank very much.
TRUMP: I said, ""How long will this last?"" Anywhere from an hour to three or four hours.
ROGAN: How long we do, Jamie? Three hours.
TRUMP: Good. Well, we'll do it again. I thought it was great.
ROGAN: I think it was great, it was a lot of fun.
TRUMP: You are a fascinating guy and you've done a great job.
ROGAN: Thank you very much.
TRUMP: I'm a big fan, and thank you very much. It's been an honor.
ROGAN: It's been an honor to have you as well.
TRUMP: I'm gonna make a great speech and I'm gonna say, and if I'm a little off tonight, I'm gonna blame you.
ROGAN: Blame me. Go ahead, blame me.
TRUMP: I'm gonna say, ""I spoke to this guy for three hours."" Anyway, it's a great honor to be with you.
ROGAN: Thank you, sir.
TRUMP: Thank you.
ROGAN: Good luck to you.
TRUMP: Thank you very much.
ROGAN: Thank you.
TRUMP: Appreciate it.
ROGAN: All right. Bye everybody.
