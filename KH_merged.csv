    Remarks by the Vice President at a Political Event in West Allis, Wisconsin
  


  

  
    July 23, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. (Applause.) Good after- — hi, Wisconsin. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you all. (Applause.) Thank you. Tha- — (laughs) — thank you. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you all. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Tha- — good afternoon, Wisconsin! (Laughs.) (Applause.)
Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you. It is good to be back. Thank you all very much. (Applause.)
Can we please hear it for Leia and her extraordinary story and leadership? (Applause.) Thank you.
And I do believe our teachers do God's work. They teach other people's children, and God knows we don't pay them enough. Let's thank her. (Applause.)
And it is so good to be here and be back with so many extraordinary leaders, including my friend, the great governor of Wisconsin, Tony Evers. (Applause.) He's here somewhere.
My dear friend, Senator Tammy Baldwin. (Applause.) And, you know, I had the privilege of serving with Tammy when I was in the United States Senate, and she is always fighting for the people of this state. And I know that the folks that are here are going to make sure you return her to Washington, D.C., in November. (Applause.) Yes, we are going to elect her back to Washington, D.C.
It is so good to be here also with Lieutenant Governor Sara Rodriguez — (applause); Attorney General Josh Kaul — (applause); Wisconsin Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski — (applause); County Executive David — David Crowley — (applause); Mayor Cavalier Johnson — (applause); and the great state party chair, Ben Wikler — (applause) — who I have worked with — Ben, you and I have been working together for years. And I can attest, he knows how to build the infrastructure that delivers wins up and down the ballot. Thank you, Ben. (Applause.)
So, it is good to be back in Wisconsin, and it is great to be in Milwaukee. (Applause.)
As many of you know, our state campaign headquarters are in this city. (Applause.) Yes. And th- — there's a reason for that: The path to the White House goes through Wisconsin. (Applause.) Yes, it does. And to win in Wisconsin, we are counting on you, right here in Milwaukee. (Applause.)
And you all helped us win in 2020. (Applause.) And in 2024, we will win again. (Applause.) Yes, we will.
So, Milwaukee, I want to start by saying a few words — and I could really speak at length — but a few words about our incredible president, Joe Biden. (Applause.)
It has truly been one of the greatest honors of my life to serve as vice president to our president, Joe Biden. (Applause.)
Joe's legacy of accomplishment over his entire career and over the past three and a half years is unmatched in modern history. (Applause.)
In one term — think about it. In one term as president, he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who served two terms in office. (Applause.)
And I know we are all deeply, deeply grateful for his continuing service to our nation. (Applause.) And it is my great honor to have Joe Biden's endorsement in this race. (Applause.)
So — so, Wisconsin, I am told, as of this morning, that we have earned the support of enough delegates to secure the Democratic nomination. (Applause.) And I am so very honored. And I pledge to you I will spend the coming weeks continuing to unite our party so that we are ready to win in November. (Applause.)
So, friends, we have 105 days until Election Day. And in that time, we've got some work to do. But we're not afraid of hard work. We like hard work, don't we? (Applause.) And we will win this election. (Applause.) Yes, we will.
So, as Leia told you, before I was elected vice president, before I was elected a United States senator, I was elected attorney general of the state of California. And I was a courtroom prosecutor before then. (Applause.)
And in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds — (laughter) — predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump's type. (Applause.) (Laughs.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And in this campaign, I promise you I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week. (Applause.)
As attorney general of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges that was scamming students. Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: As a prosecutor, I specialized in cases involving sexual abuse. Well, Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: As attorney general of California, I took on the big Wall Street banks and held them accountable for fraud. (Applause.) Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud on 34 counts. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Lock him up!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But let's also make no mistake: This campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. This campaign is about who we fight for. (Applause.) This is about who we fight for.
Just look at how we are running our campaigns. So, Donald Trump is relying on support from billionaires and big corporations, and he is trading access in exchange for campaign contributions.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: A couple of months ago — y'all saw that? — a couple months ago at Mar-a-Lago, he literally promised Big Oil companies — Big Oil lobbyists he would do their bidding for $1 billion in campaign donations.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: On the other hand, we are running a people-powered campaign. (Applause.) And we just had — some breaking news: We just had the best 24 hours — (applause) — of grassroot fundraising in presidential campaign history. (Applause.) All right?
And because we are a people-powered campaign, that is how you know we will be a people-first presidency. (Applause.)
And, Wisconsin, this campaign is also about two different visions for our nation: one where we are focused on the future, the other focused on the past.
We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead — (applause); a future where no child has to grow up in poverty — (applause); where every worker has the freedom to join a union — (applause); where every person has affordable health care — (applause) — affordable childcare — (applause) — and paid family leave. (Applause.) We believe in a future where every senior can retire with dignity. (Applause.)
So, all of this is to say: Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. (Applause.) Because here's the thing we all here, Wisconsin, know: When our middle class is strong, American is strong. (Applause.)
But Donald Trump wants to take our country backward. He and his extreme Project 2025 agenda —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — will weaken the middle class.
Like, we know we got to take this seriously. And can you believe they put that thing in writing? (Laughter.) Read it. It's 900 pages.
But here's the thing: You — when you read it, you will see Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and make working families foot the bill.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: They intend to end the Affordable Care Act —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and take us back, then, to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Remember what that was like?
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Children with asthma, women who survived breast cancer, grandparents with diabetes.
America has tried these failed economic policies before, but we are not going back. (Applause.) We are not going back. We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back.
And I'll tell you why we're not going back: because ours is a fight for the future. (Applause.) And it is a fight for freedom. (Applause.)
Generations of Americas b- — generations — and we have to remember this: the shoulders on which we stand. Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. And now, Wisconsin, the baton is in our hands. (Applause.)
We who believe in the sacred freedom to vote — (applause) — will make sure every American has the ability to cast their ballot and have it counted. (Applause.)
We who believe that every person in our nation sh- — who should have the freedom to live safe from the terror of gun violence — (applause) — will finally pass red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban. (Applause.)
And we who believe in reproductive freedom — (applause) — will stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans because we trust women to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do. (Applause.)
And when Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms, as president of the United States, I will sign it into law. (Applause.)
So, Wisconsin, ultimately, in this election, we each face a question: What kind of country do we want to live in?
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: A country — (laughter and applause). And to your point — (laughter) — do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law — (applause) — or a country of chaos, fear, and hate?
AUDIENCE: No!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And here's the beauty of this moment: We each have the power to answer that question. The power is with the people. (Applause.) We each have the power to answer that question.
And in the next 105 days, then, we have work to do. (Applause.) We have doors to knock on, we have phone calls to make, we have voters to register, and we have an election to win. (Applause.)
So, Wisconsin, today I ask you: Are you ready to get to work? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

    Statement by the Vice President on Anti-Semitic Protests at Union Station
  


  

  
    July 25, 2024  

  
    Yesterday, at Union Station in Washington, D.C. we saw despicable acts by unpatriotic protestors and dangerous hate-fueled rhetoric.
I condemn any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the State of Israel and kill Jews. Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation.
I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.
I support the right to peacefully protest, but let's be clear: Antisemitism, hate and violence of any kind have no place in our nation.

    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. (Applause.) (Laughs.) Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)
Thank you all. (Laughs.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) (Laughs.)
Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Oh, thank you so very much.
Pl- -- can we please give it up for James Taylor, by the way? (Laughs.) (Applause.)
Oh, what a great treat for me to be on the same stage with James Taylor. (Laughter and applause.) And Kim and Henry Taylor, as well, are here, and I want to thank the whole family. And, James, in particular, thank you for always using the gift of your voice in such a courageous way.
You provide us joy. You provide us moments for reflection. But you're always standing up, also, for what we care about and love in terms of our country. So, thank you for that. (Applause.) Thank you.
And thank you to all of today's performers for being such an important part of this afternoon, including the great Yo-Yo Ma -- (applause) -- and the extraordinary Emanuel Ax. (Applause.) Thank you all.
You know, the -- the -- an important part of every movement is our artists. And so, I -- I'm very honored to be with you all today. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)
And it is good to be with so many incredible leaders, including, of course, Senator Elizabeth Warren -- (applause) --Senator Ed Markey -- (applause) -- Congressman Richie Neal -- (applause) -- Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll -- (applause) -- Mayor Pete Marchetti. (Applause.) And I also thank my dear friend, former Governor Deval Patrick -- (applause) -- and former first lady Diane Patrick -- (applause) -- and the entire host committee for welcoming us today. Thank you all.
So, I will begin by saying a bit -- although I could talk all afternoon -- about our incredible president, Joe Biden. (Applause.)
So, it has truly been one of the greatest honors of my life and career to serve as vice president to Joe Biden.
His legacy of acco- -- and James and I were just talking about this -- his legacy of accomplishment over his entire career and over the past three and a half years is unmatched in modern history.
In one term, he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who have served two terms in office. And as he said in his Oval Office address earlier this week, in the next six months, he will continue to fight for the American people. (Applause.) And I know we are all deeply, deeply grateful for his continued service to our nation. (Applause.)
And it is also my great honor to have Joe Biden's endorsement in this race. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
And many of you may know, already, we have earned the support of enough delegates to secure the Democratic nomination. (Applause.) I thank you for the help. (Laughs.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all. (Applause.)
And I pledge to you that in the coming weeks, I will continue to work so very hard to do what we must do to unite our party on the path to uniting our country.
And so, let me just say a few things about my background.
Many of you may know, before I was elected vice president of the United States, I was a United States senator. And before then, I was elected attorney general of California. And before that, district attorney of San Francisco. And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor.
All that to say -- (laughter and applause) -- in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds -- (laughter and applause) -- predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump's type. (Laughter and applause.)
In fact, I have been dealing with people like him my entire career. (Laughter.)
For example, as attorney general, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges that was scamming students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students.
As a prosecutor, I specialized in sexual abuse cases. Well, Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse.
As attorney general, I held the big Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud -- 34 counts.
So, in this campaign -- and I say in all seriousness -- I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week. (Applause.) Any day of the week.
But let us -- let us make no mistake. This campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump.
Our campaign has always been about two very different visions for our nation. One, ours, that is focused on the future, and the other that is focused almost entirely on the past.
We believe in a future that keeps America's economy the strongest in the world; a future that promotes both economic growth and economic fairness, where every person has the opportunity to compete, thrive, and prosper -- to build a business, to own a home, and to build generational wealth; where we, in the future, bring down cost for hardworking Americans so they can afford to pay their bills and still have something left over, so they have a chance not just to get by but to get ahead; a future where every worker has the freedom to join a union -- (applause) -- where no child has to grow up in poverty -- (applause) -- and where every senior can retire with dignity -- (applause); a future with affordable health care, affordable childcare, and paid leave. (Applause.)
All of this is to say that building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. Because we know -- (applause) -- when America's middle class is strong, America is strong. (Applause.)
But as we fight to move our nation forward, Donald Trump intends to take our country backward. Just look at his Project 2025 agenda. A- -- and, by the way, can you believe they put that thing in writing? (Laughter.) Nine hundred pages of it. (Laughter.)
So, Project 2025 is a plan that would return America to a very dark past -- and weaken the middle class, by the way.
Independent economists have said Trump's plans would reignite inflation, slow economic growth, and increase unemployment.
Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and make working families foot the bill.
He intends to end the Affordable Care Act and take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions.
You guys remember what that was? It was real. Children with asthma. Breast cancer survivors. Grandparents with diabetes.
And America has tried these failed policies before. And we are not going back. We are not going back. (Applause.)
We are not going back. We are not going back. (Applause.)
And, you know, there's been this, I think, quite perverse thing that has been happening over the last several years, which is that some folks would suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down -- you know that -- have you noticed? -- right? -- that somehow you're strong if you're a bully? -- instead of what we all know: The true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up -- who you lift up. (Applause.) That's the strength of a leader.
And so, to the friends here, I say, it is we who are working to lift up the people of America. We're clear about this.
You know, and when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for.
We are clear, it is we who are intent on lifting up the people of our nation. And ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom.
Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom, and now the baton is in our hands. It's in our hands.
We, who believe in the sacred freedom to vote, will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. (Applause.)
We -- we, who believe that every person in our nation should have the freedom to live safe from the terror of gun violence, will finally pass universal background checks -- (applause) -- red flag laws, and an assault weapons ban. (Applause.)
And we, who believe in reproductive freedom, will stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans -- (applause) -- because we trust women to make decisions about their own bodies and not have their government telling them what to do. (Applause.)
And -- I'm just going off script for a second. So, here's the thing -- (laughter) --
Think about it. You know, there's so much about what we have prided ourselves in about our country in terms of progress, understanding that one of the defining components of that progress is the expansion of rights. And we are seeing a full-on agenda that is now about restricting rights -- and one of the most fundamental rights, the right to make decisions about your own body.
Think about that. And if there are those who dare to take the freedom to make such a fundamental decision for an individual, which is about one's own body, what other freedoms could be on the table for the taking? (Applause.)
This is serious business -- serious business. And I pledge to you, when Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms, as president of the United States, I will sign it into law. (Applause.)
So, to everyone here and all the friends I say, you know, ultimately, in this election, I do believe that each one of us faces a question. That question being, what kind of country do we want to live in?
Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law, or a country of chaos, fear, and hate?
And the beauty of our democracy is that each one of us has the power to answer that question. And the power then, I say, is with the people. The power is with the people.
So, in 101 days, which is November 5th -- (laughter) -- let us be clear-eyed: We have a fight ahead of us. We got a fight ahead of us. And we are the underdogs in this race. Okay? Level set. We're the underdogs in this race.
But this is a people-powered campaign, and we have momentum. The day after I announced my candidacy, we saw the best 24 hours of grassroots fundraising in presidential campaign history. (Applause.)
And since then -- and since then, in battleground states, people have been flooding our offices around the country to volunteer. So -- (applause) -- this is good. We've got momentum. It's on our side.
And you may have noticed Donald Trump has been resorting to some wild lies about my record. And some of what he and his running mate are saying, it's just plain weird. (Laughter.) I mean, that's the box you put that in, right? (Laughter and applause.)
And you may have seen he just pulled out of our debate.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Mm-hmm. Right? I hope he reconsiders. I hope he reconsiders. Because we have a lot to talk about. (Laughter and applause.) Yep.
But the bottom line is we have our work cut out for us. Okay? We have our work cut out for us. And this is not going to be easy. But I know something about the folks in this room. We can do hard things. And we like hard work. That's good work.
And on that point, I will say, it is because of that I will tell you what I sincerely and deeply know and believe: We are going to win. (Applause.) We are going to win.
So, today I ask, are you ready to get to work?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in freedom?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in opportunity?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in the promise of America?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And are we ready to fight for it?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And when we fight, we win. (Applause.)
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)
Thank you all. Thank you.

Good evening. (Applause.)

My goodness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Laughs.) Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Thank you. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
My goodness. Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody.
Oh, it's good to be back in Georgia. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Thank you.
Everyone, can we please hear it for Tyler? (Applause.)
I want to thank Tyler for that incredible introduction. I invited him and several other young entrepreneurs to come and visit with me at the White House, and we had a, really, very long and important conversation about the future of America. And, Tyler, you represent the best of our future. Thank you for that. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you.
And please give it up for Quavo — (applause) — and Megan. (Applause.)
So, it is so good to see everyone. And let me — let me also thank our incredible members of Congress who are with us this evening: Senator Jon Ossoff — (applause); Senator Raphael Warnock — (applause); and Representative Nikema Williams — (applause).
To Mayor Andre Dickens, thank you for welcoming me back — (applause) — to Atlanta.
And thank you to the great Stacey Abrams — (applause) — for your extraordinary leadership.
So, Georgia, it is so good to be back. And I am very clear, the path to the White House runs right through this state. (Applause.) And you all helped us win in 2020, and we going to do it again in 2024. (Applause.) Yes, we will. Yes, we will.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, let's get right down — (laughs) — so — (applause) — so, I'm going to get i- — I'm — I'm going to get into some business now. Okay? (Laughter.) I'm going to get into some business now. All right.
So, Georgia, as many of you know, before — and have a seat, if you have a chair. (Laughter.)
As many of you know, before I was elected vice president and before I was elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and an elected district attorney. (Applause.) And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. (Applause.)
So, in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds — (applause): predators who abused women — (applause); fraudsters who ripped off consumers — (applause); cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain — (applause). So, hear me when I say I know Donald Trump's type. (Applause.) I know the type. And I have been dealing with people like him my entire career.
For example, as attorney general of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges that was scamming students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: As a prosecutor, I specialized in child sexual abuse cases and sexual abuse cases. Well, Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And as an attorney general, I held the big Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud — (applause) — 34 counts.
So, in this —
AUDIENCE: Lock him up!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, in this campaign —
AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Inaudible.) (Inaudible.)
So, in this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week — (applause) — any day of the week, including, for example, on the issue of immigration.
So, I was the attorney general of a border state. In that job, I walked underground tunnels between the United States and Mexico on that border with law enforcement officers. I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers that came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won.
Donald Trump — (applause) — Donald Trump, on the other hand, has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk — (applause) — or as my friend Quavo would say, he does not walk it like he talks it. (Applause.)
Where's Quavo? (Laughs.)
So, look, our administration worked on the most significant border security bill in decades. Some of the most conservative Republicans in Washington, D.C., supported the bill. Even the Border Patrol endorsed it. It was all set to pass. But at the last minute, Trump directed his allies in the Senate to vote it down.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right.
He tanked — tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — which goes to show Donald Trump does not care about border security; he only cares about himself. (Applause.)
And when I am president, I will work to actually solve the problem. (Applause.)
So, here is my pledge to you. As president, I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed, and I will sign it into law — (applause) — and show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like. (Applause.)
But make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. Truly, this campaign is about two very different visions for our nation — (applause): one focused on the future, the other focused on the past. (Applause.)
We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity to build a business — (applause) — to own a home, to build intergenerational wealth — (applause); a future with affordable health care — (applause) — affordable childcare, paid leave. (Applause.)
And all of this is to say: Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. (Applause.) Because we here all know, when our middle class is strong, America is strong. (Applause.)
And to keep our middle class strong, families need relief from the high cost of living so that they have a chance not just to get by but to get ahead. (Applause.)
And, yes, it is true that by many indicators, our economy is the strongest in the world — (applause) — but while inflation is down and wages are up, prices are still too high. (Applause.) You know it, and I know it. (Applause.)
And when we win this election, here's what we're going to do about it.
On day one, I will take on price gouging and bring down costs. (Applause.)
We will ban more of those hidden fees and surprise late charges that banks and other companies use to pad their profits. (Applause.)
We will take on corporate landlords and cap unfair rent increases. (Applause.)
And we will take on Big Pharma to cap prescription drug costs for all Americans. (Applause.)
Our plan will lower costs and save many middle-class families thousands of dollars a year. But Donald Trump has a different plan in mind, one that would raise prices on middle-class families. Just look at his Project 2025 agenda.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I take it you've seen it. (Laughter.)
Project 2025 is a plan to weaken the middle class, be clear. And Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to gut our investments in clean energy jobs.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to end the Affordable Care Act —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — to take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. Do you guys remember what that was? Children with asthma. Breast cancer survivors. Grandparents with diabetes.
Georgia, America has tried these failed policies before, and we are not —
AUDIENCE: Going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — going back. (Applause.) We're not going back. We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom. (Applause.)
Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights: the freedom to vote — (applause); the freedom to be safe from gun violence — (applause); the freedom to live without fear of bigotry and hate — (applause); the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride — (applause); the freedom to learn and acknowledge our true and full history — (applause); and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body — (applause) — and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
Ours is a fight for the future and for freedom. And I don't have to tell folks in Atlanta that generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. And now the baton is in our hands — (applause) — each and every one of us.
And we love our country. We love our country. And I believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. (Applause.)
And so, we, who believe in the sacred freedom to vote, will finally pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. (Applause.)
We, who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence, will finally pass universal background checks — (applause), red flag laws — (applause), and an assault weapons ban — (applause).
We, who believe in reproductive freedom — (applause) — will stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans. And when Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms — (applause) — as president of the United States, I will sign it into law. (Applause.)
So, November 5th — November 5th is in 98 days. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: An- — (Laughs.) (Applause.)
So, in 98 days — and let's level set. Friends, let's level set. We have a fight in front of us. (Applause.) We have a fight in front of us, and we are the underdogs in this race. We are.
But you see, this is a people-powered campaign. (Applause.) Ours is a people-powered campaign.
In fact, after I announced my candidacy, we saw the best week of grassroots fundraising in presidential campaign history. (Applause.) And if you go to KamalaHarris.com, you can help us build on that success. (Applause.)
So, the momentum in this race is shifting. And there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it. (Laughter and applause.) You may have noticed.
So, last week, you may have seen, he pulled out of the debate in September he had previously agreed to.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So — so, here's the thing. Here- — here's the funny thing about that. Here's the funny thing about that. So, he won't debate, but he and his running mate sure seem to have a lot to say about me. (Applause.)
And, by the way, don't you find some of their stuff to just be plain weird? (Applause.)
Well, Donald — (applause) — I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage — (applause) — because, as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
So, Georgia, in the next 98 days, we have our work cut out for us. And this is not going to be easy. This is hard work, but we like hard work. Hard work is good work. (Applause.)
So, Georgia, today I ask you: Are you ready to get to work?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in freedom?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in opportunity?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in the promise of America?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And are we ready to fight for it?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win!
God bless you. God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Houston, Texas
  


  

  
    July 31, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good evening, Texas. (Applause.) Can we please hear it for Sima? (Applause.)
Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Please have a seat. Please have a seat.
Sima, thank you for those kind words. You just hosted me in your home just a few months ago, and you've really been tireless in your support of me and, before this, of the president and me. And, in fact, I -- he and I had our regular lunch today, and so I bring you greetings from Joe Biden and thanks from him -- (applause) -- for all you have done here. Thank you all.
I want to thank everyone who was a part of this. And, in particular, I want to also thank -- in addition to Sima -- Eartha, Lonnie, and the entire host committee for bringing us together.
And thank you as well to all the extraordinary leaders who are here. We have Representative Al Green -- (applause); Representative Lizzie Fletcher -- (applause); Representative Sylvia Garcia -- (applause); Greg Casar, who was here with his mother -- was, still is, there -- there somewhere -- there you are -- (laughs) -- (applause); Judge Lina Hidalgo -- (applause); and my long-standing friend, Commissioner Rodney Ellis. (Applause.)
And, of course, in front of all the friends here, I must thank our national finance chair, Chris Korge, for all that you do, Chris -- (applause) -- and have been doing.
And to all of the leaders here, I thank you. And it is wonderful to be with you.
So, last week, I visited an emergency operations center in Houston. I was just here last week. I was with, actually, the commissioner and the mayor. And I received a briefing from first responders on the recovery efforts after Hurricane Beryl. And I just want to make clear that our administration is making sure that this city has all the resources that you need to recover quickly and fully. (Applause.)
And, of course, we must also tackle the climate crisis. And it -- we are seeing increasingly that it is fueling these kinds of disasters because of increasing extreme weather around our country. And so, we will stay committed to that as well.
And with that -- so, as Sima said, we have 97 days to go -- (applause) -- 97 days until the election. And I know many of us have been involved in these elections every four years, and every four years, we say, ""This is the one."" (Laughter.) Well, this here is the one. (Applause.) This is the one. (Laughs.) This is the one.
And as Sima said -- really, it is -- I mean, the most existential, consequential, and important election of our lifetimes. And in this election, I think it's so important that we remember, we are not fighting against something; we are fighting for something. It's very important to remember.
We love our country. We are fighting for the best of who we are. This is a fight for the future of our nation and for our most fundamental freedoms and rights.
And in this fight, borne out of love of country, we believe in the promise of America. So many of us are empirical evidence of the promise of America. Right? (Applause.) Right? And the promise of America includes a promise of freedom and opportunity and justice, not just for some but for all. And we know we are in this fight, then, because we know how much is at stake.
As many of you know, before I was elected vice president, before I was elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and, before that, elected district attorney. And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. (Applause.)
So, in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all types -- (laughter): predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their personal gain. So, hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump's type. (Applause.)
In fact, I've been dealing with people like him my entire career. (Laughter.)
For example, as attorney general of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges that was scamming students, including our veterans. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students. (Laughter.)
As a prosecutor, I specialized in sexual abuse cases. Well -- (laughter) -- Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse.
As an attorney general, I held the big Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud -- 34 counts. (Applause.)
So, in this campaign, I say to all the friends here: I proudly put my record against his any day of the week -- (applause) -- any day of the week.
But, again, let us not make any mistake: This campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. It truly is about two very different visions for our nation -- one that is focused on the future and the other that is focused on the past.
And I know the leaders who are in this room, and so I say what I know to be true. We here believe in a future, for example, with affordable health care, affordable childcare, paid family leave.
We believe in a future where no child grows up in poverty, where every senior can retire with dignity, where all people have clean water to drink and clean air to breathe.
We believe in a future -- (applause) -- that keeps America's economy the strongest in the world; where every person has the opportunity to build a business, to own a home, to build intergenerational wealth. (Applause.)
These are the things we believe in. And we see, then, a future where we bring down the cost of living for hardworking Americans so that people have a chance not just to get by but to get ahead. And that is so much of what is fueling our campaign.
And that is why, when I am president, I will take on price gouging and bring down costs; I will ban more of those hidden fees and surprise late charges that banks and other companies use to pad their profits; I will take on corporate landlords and cap rent increases; and take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. (Applause.)
And all of this is to say, building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. (Applause.) Because we here know, when America's middle class is strong, America is strong. (Applause.)
But as we move forward -- as we move our nation forward, Donald Trump, as I said and as we know, intends to take our country backward. And as a prime example, just look at his Project 2025 agenda. Project 2025 is a plan to weaken the middle class.
I invite those who might need some help sleeping to take a look at it -- (laughter) -- but it'll keep you awake when you do. It'll keep you awake when you do, because you will see in that and in the words and in the policies and in the background of Donald Trump, he intends to cut Social Security and Medicare; he intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations; and he intends to end the Affordable Care Act and take us back to a time when -- many of us remember -- when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions.
You remember that? It wasn't very long ago. Remember what that meant for children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes?
And, you know, America has tried these failed policies before. But we are not going back. We are not going back. Ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom.
You know, I've been traveling -- as Sima said, I've been traveling our country for the last three and a half years, but starting this year, I mean, I think, before last week, I'd taken over -- almost 80 trips just this year alone.
And I will tell you, across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault against hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights -- (applause): the freedom to vote -- and we can look at this region of the country to have all those examples; the freedom to be safe from gun violence; the freedom to live -- (applause) -- without fear of bigotry and hate; the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride -- (applause); the freedom to learn and acknowledge America's full history -- (applause); and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body -- (applause) -- and not have her government tell her what to do.
And, by the way, just -- let's pause on that for a moment and think about this. Regardless of your gender, imagine that in this year of our Lord, 2024, one in three women of reproductive age lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban.
Regardless of your gender, think about it from this perspective: that at this moment, our country -- and in our country, the highest court took one of the most basic freedoms that any individual could have, the freedom to make decisions about your own body -- not your property, not your busi- -- I mean, and that would be a problem too -- but your own body. Think about that. (Applause.)
And if that freedom is being taken, what else could be on the line? That's where we are right now in our country.
But here's the thing we know: Generations of Americans before us led in the fight for freedom. And now the baton is in our hands -- each and every one of us.
And so, we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. (Applause.)
We who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass universal background checks -- (applause) -- and red flag laws and an assault weapons ban.
We who believe in reproductive freedom will fight for a woman's right to choose. (Applause.)
And we remember that when he was president, Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court -- the court of Thurgood and RBG -- because he intended for them to overturn the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did. And now more than 20 states have a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest.
And if he wins, I promise you he intends to pass a nationwide abortion ban to ban abortion in every state. But I will not let that happen. (Applause.) I will not let that happen.
And when I am president and when Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms, I will sign it into law. (Applause.)
In this moment, our fundamental freedoms are on the ballot -- our fundamental freedoms are on the ballot and so is our democracy -- so is our democracy.
We cannot overlook what happened this month when the United States Supreme Court -- please remember and keep this in mind, because this election, this is not 2016 or 2020 in so many ways, including this. This month, the United States Supreme Court basically just told the former president, who has been convicted of fraud, that, going forward, he will be immune for activity we know he is prepared to engage in if he gets back in the White House.
So, think about that. At least before, there was the threat that there might be consequence. Now there is implicit -- some would say explicit -- authority to know there will be no consequence.
And pair that up with the fact Donald Trump has openly vowed, if reelected, he will be a dictator on day one, that he will weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies, that he will round up peaceful protesters and throw them out of our country, and even, quote, ""terminate"" the Constitution of the United States.
So, let us be very clear: Someone who suggested he should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again have the chance to stand behind a microphone -- (applause) -- and never again have the chance to stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. (Applause.) Never again.
This is serious business. So, ultimately, in this election, I think we all know, we each face a question and the question being: What kind of country do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law or a country of chaos, fear, and hate?
And the beauty of our democracy -- because we intend to keep it -- the beauty of our democracy is that we each have the power to answer that question. We each have the power to answer that question. The power is with the people.
So, November 5th is 97 days from now. And let's level set. We are the underdogs in this race. There is enthusiasm, Sima mentioned, historic numbers in terms of what we have done, grassroots fundraising, the numbers of volunteers that are coming in. We are the underdogs in this race.
So, let's level set. We have a fight in front of us. And we have work to do -- hard work, good hard work. (Laughter.) And this is the thing: We like hard work. Hard work is good work.
But this is not the time, then -- (applause) -- this is not the time, then -- as we all know, which is why we're here together, this is not our time to throw up our hands. This is our time to roll up our sleeves.
And together, we will fight to build the nation that we love and that the people deserve.
And we know that when we fight --
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win! (Applause.) (Inaudible.)
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)
Thank you all very much. Thank you. (Applause.)
Thank you very much. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.

    Remarks by the Vice President with Governor Tim Walz at a Campaign Event in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
  


  

  
    August 06, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're doing this! (Applause.) Oh! (Applause.) We're doing this. (Applause.) We're doing this. (Applause.)
Good evening, Philadelphia! (Applause.) Good evening. (Applause.) Good evening, good evening. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Good evening.
Oh, it is good to be back in Pennsylvania. (Applause.)
So, let me say, on behalf of myself and the first second gentleman of the United States, my husband, Doug Emhoff -- (applause) -- thank you for the warm welcome. (Applause.)
And let me just say, it's good to be here with all of the friends, all of the leaders who are here. I want to thank former Governor Ed Rendell -- (applause); Senator Bob Casey, who we will reelect this November -- (applause); Senator John Fetterman -- (applause); Mayor Cherelle Parker -- (applause); and Chairman Jaime Harrison. (Applause.)
And it is so good to be here with your incredible governor, Josh Shapiro. (Applause.) And I will say Josh is a dear, dear friend and an extraordinary leader. He and I have been spending a lot of time together over the years. And I told Josh, ""Look, I am so, so invested in our friendship, in doing this together."" Because together, with Josh Shapiro, we will win Pennsylvania. (Applause.) We will win Pennsylvania.
And I thank you, Josh. I thank you. (Applause.)
So -- so, Philadelphia, I launched my campaign for the president of the United States a mere two weeks ago. (Applause.) And it's -- it's been a bit of a whirlwind. (Laughter.)
And just last night, the delegates to the Democratic National Convention finished voting, and so -- (applause) -- I stand -- I stand before you today to proudly announce I am now officially the Democratic nominee for president of the United States. (Applause.)
And so, now we got some work to do. We need to move to the general election and win that. (Applause.)
And to all the friends, listen, we also need to level set. We are the underdogs in this race, but we have the momentum, and I know exactly what we are up against. (Applause.)
Now, many of you know, before I was elected vice president or elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and, before that, elected district attorney. (Applause.) And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. (Applause.)
So, in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds -- (applause): predators who abused women --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- fraudsters who scammed consumers --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, hear me when I say -- (applause) -- I know Donald Trump's type. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So -- but let --
AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Let me -- let me just say.
AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Let me say. Hold on.
AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hold on, hold on.
This campaign, our campaign is not just a fight against Donald Trump. (Applause.) Our campaign, this campaign is a fight for the future. (Applause.) It's a fight for the future.
And, Pennsylvania, we fight for a future with affordable housing, affordable health care, affordable childcare, paid leave. (Applause.) We fight for a future where we build a broad-based economy where every American has the opportunity to own a home, to start a business, and to build wealth. (Applause.)
We fight for a future where we bring down prices that are still too high and lower the cost of living for American families -- (applause) -- so that they have the chance not just to get by but to get ahead. (Applause.)
We fight for a future where we defend our most fundamental freedoms: the freedom to vote -- (applause); the freedom to be safe from gun violence -- (applause); the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride -- (applause); and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body not having her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
So --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I love you too.
So, here's the thing. Here's the thing. Since the day that I announced my candidacy, I set out to find a partner who can help build this brighter future -- (applause) -- a leader who will help unite our nation and move us forward; a fighter for the middle class; a patriot who believes, as I do, in the extraordinary promise of America -- (applause) -- a promise -- a promise of freedom, opportunity, and justice not just for some but for all. (Applause.)
So, Pennsylvania, I'm here today because I found such a leader: Governor Tim Walz of the great state of Minnesota. (Applause.)
So, to those who know him best -- to those who know him best, Tim is -- is more than a governor. To his wife, Gwen, he is a husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is a dad. To his fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz. (Applause.) To the people -- to the people of Southern Minnesota, for 12 years, he was Congressman. (Applause.) To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz. (Applause.) And to his former high school football players, he was Coach -- (applause) -- Coach -- Coach.
And in 91 days -- (applause) -- the nation will know Coach Walz by another name: vice president of the United States. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Tim! Tim! Tim!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, America, for some folks, they're just getting to know Coach Walz's story. And I'll tell you, he is the proud product of a middle-class family in rural Nebraska. (Applause.) He is a veteran who served our nation in uniform for more than two decades -- (applause) -- as a member of the Army National Guard, and he went to college on the G.I. Bill. (Applause.)
He is someone who, long before he entered politics, worked as a teacher. (Applause.) When Coach Walz and his wife, Gwen, moved from his native Nebraska to Minnesota nearly 30 years ago, they both took jobs at the local high school. (Applause.) Coach Walz taught social studies; Gwen taught English. (Applause.)
After school, Tim was the linebackers coach for the football team -- (applause) -- where I've heard the stories about he had a knack for using the game of football to teach life lessons. He saw the potential in kids who sometimes didn't even see it in themselves. (Applause.)
Under those Friday night lights, Coach Walz motivated his players to believe they could achieve anything. And, together, they defied the odds -- hear this out -- going from a winless record to the school's first-ever state championship. (Applause.) (Laughs.) Coach. Coach. A- --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) (Laughter.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I'll say and I'll add, Tim wasn't only a role model on the football field. Around that same time, Coach Walz was approached by a student in his social studies class. The young man was one of the first openly gay students at the school and was hoping to start a gay-straight alliance. At a time -- (applause) -- at a time when acceptance was difficult to find for LGBTQ students, Tim knew the signal that it would send to have a football coach get involved. (Applause.) Right?
So, he signed up to be the group's faculty advisor. (Applause.) And as students have said, he made the school a safe place for everybody. (Applause.) In the high school yearbook, the students voted Coach Walz the, quote, ""most inspiring faculty member."" (Applause.)
And as I think everyone here can see, Tim Walz was the kind of teacher and mentor that every child in America dreams of having -- (applause) -- and that every kid deserves; the kind of coach, because he's the kind of person who makes people feel like they belong and then inspires them to dream big. And that's the kind of vice president he will be. (Applause.) And that's the kind of vice president America deserves. (Applause.)
So, it was Coach Walz's students who actually helped him decide to run for office, and he served 12 years in Congress, representing a purple district, as he reached across the aisle to get things done.
He was the highest-ranking -- (applause) -- he was the highest-ranking enlisted man to ever serve in the United States Congress -- (applause) -- and the top Democrat on the Veterans Committee. (Applause.) And he was known as one of Capitol Hill's best marksmen -- (laughter) -- winning a bipartisan sharpshooting contest year after year. (Applause.)
In Washington, Tim worked to raise the minimum wage -- (applause); to protect the freedom of workers to join a union -- (applause); and he cast one of the critical votes to pass the Affordable Care Act -- (applause) -- which, of course, gave health insurance to tens of millions of Americans.
And I'm going to tell you, when we win, Tim and I will continue to make the Affordable Care Act even stronger. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: When we win! When we win! When we win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We will win. That's right.
Now let's talk about what we're dealing with on the other side.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, on that last topic, if Donald Trump gets the chance, he will end the Affordable Care Act --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was like? Children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes.
Well, Governor Walz and I will not let that happen -- (applause) -- because we believe health care should be a right and not just a privilege for those who can afford it. (Applause.)
As governor, Tim has continued to fight for working families. He secured paid leave for workers in Minnesota. (Applause.) And he refused -- he refused, as governor, to allow any student in their public schools to go hungry -- (applause) -- so he made school breakfast and lunch free for every child. (Applause.)
And Tim Walz and I, we agree about many things, including when our middle class is strong, America is strong. (Applause.) And strengthening the middle class will be my defining goal as I am president of the United States. (Applause.)
So, Pennsylvania, ours is a fight for the future of the middle class and it is a fight for freedom. (Applause.) In this moment, we are witnessing a full-on attack against hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights. (Applause.)
Take reproductive freedom. Now think about this: Donald Trump said he wants to punish women.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And as a result of his actions, today in America one out of three women live in a state with a Trump abortion ban -- one out of three.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Some of these bans go back to the 1800s, even before women had a right to vote. Think about that.
Well, Tim and I have a message for Trump and others who want to turn back the clock on our fundamental freedoms: We're not going back. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And so, let me say about Tim Walz, he has shown up to stand against these attacks long before he stood on the stage with me. After Roe was overturned, he was the first governor in the country to sign a new law that enshrined reproductive freedom as a fundamental right. (Applause.)
And with Tim Walz by my side, when I am president of the United States and we win majorities in the United States Congress, we will pass a bill to restore reproductive freedom, and I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.)
Tim Walz has also defended the sacred freedom to vote. As governor -- (applause) -- as governor, he signed the most significant expansion of voting rights in Minnesota in over 50 years. (Applause.) And with Governor Walz's help, when I am president, we are going to finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. (Applause.) We're going to get it done.
So, Tim is a hunter and a gun owner who believes, as the majority of gun owners do, that we need reasonable gun safety laws in America. (Applause.) So, as governor, he expanded background checks and increased penalties for illegal firearm sales. (Applause.)
And together, when we win in November, we are finally going to pass universal background checks -- (applause) -- red flag laws, and an assault weapons ban. (Applause.)
Through his work, Tim, he -- you know, the way I think about it, he really does shine a light on a brighter future that we can build together. In his state, he has been a model chief executive. And with his experience, I'm telling you, Tim Walz will be ready on day one. (Applause.)
In fact -- in fact, when you compare his resume -- (laughter) -- shall we? -- to Trump's running mate, well -- well -- well, some might say it's like -- it's like a matchup between the varsity team and the JV squad. (Applause.) (Laughs.)
So, Pennsylvania, ultimately, in this election, we each face a question: What kind of country do we want to live in? A country -- a country of freedom -- (applause) -- compassion, and rule of law or a country of chaos, fear, and hate?
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And here's the beauty of our democracy: We each have the power to answer that question. We each have the power to answer that question. (Applause.) The power is with the people. (Applause.)
We love our country, and I believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. (Applause.) That -- that is how we preserve the promise of America.
And after all, you know, the promise of America is what makes it possible for two middle-class kids -- one a daughter of Oakland, California -- (applause) -- who was raised by a working mother; the other a son of the Nebraska plains who grew up working on a farm -- (applause) -- it's the promise of America, because only in America -- only in America is it possible for them together to make it all the way to the White House. (Applause.)
Only in America. Only in America. Only in America.
AUDIENCE: U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right.
AUDIENCE: U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. That's right.
And so, Coach Walz and I may hail from different corners of our great country, but our values are the same. And we both believe in lifting people up, not knocking them down. (Applause.)
He and I, we both know the vast majority of people in our country have so much more in common than what separates them. (Applause.) When we look at folks, we see, in our fellow Americans, neighbors, not enemies -- (applause) -- not enemies.
And so, my promise to you is this. Our campaign will reach out to everyone, from red states to blue states -- (applause) -- from the heartland to the coasts; in rural, urban, suburban, and Tribal communities. (Applause.) We are running a campaign on behalf of all Americans. (Applause.) And when elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans. (Applause.)
And so, with Tim Walz by my side and with all of you at our side -- (applause) -- let us fight for the promise of our future. (Applause.)
And with that, I ask: Pennsylvania, are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight --
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win. (Applause.)
And now welcome the next vice president of the United States, Tim Walz. (Applause.)
GOVERNOR WALZ: Wow. (Applause.) Thank you. Wow.
Thank you, Philadelphia. (Applause.)
Thank you, Madam Vice President, for the trust you put in me but, maybe more so, thank you for bringing back the joy. (Applause.) I'm thrilled to be on this journey with you and Doug -- this incredible journey.
And, Pennsylvania, I know you know this, but, my God, what a treasure you have in Josh Shapiro. (Applause.) Holy hell, can this guy bring the fire. He can bring the fire. This is a visionary leader. Also, I have to tell you, everybody in America knows, when you need a bridge fixed, call that guy. (Applause.)
And I think sometimes we forget and you see people a little one-dimensional, but seeing a guy who cares so deeply about his family, a man with compassion, vision -- and I'll have to tell you this; I know this from experience -- there is no one you would rather go to a Springsteen concert in Jersey with than him -- (laughter) -- than that guy. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Bruce!
GOVERNOR WALZ: Bruce!
And I can't wait for all of you and America to get to know my incredible wife, Gwen, a 29-year public school educator --(applause) -- don't ever underestimate teachers -- (applause) -- and our two beautiful kids, Hope and Gus.
I couldn't be prouder to be on this ticket and to help Vice President Harris become what we all know is very, very good for us to think about: next president of the United States of America. (Applause.)
From her first day as a prosecutor, as a district attorney, attorney general of the great state of California -- (applause) -- a United States senator, and vice president of the United States -- (applause) -- Vice President Harris has fought on the side of the American people. (Applause.)
She took on the predators, she took on the fraudsters, she took down the transnational gangs, she stood up against powerful corporate interests, and she never hesitated to reach across the aisle if it meant improving people's lives. (Applause.) And I want all of you to hold this and don't ever underestimate the power of this: She does it all with a sense of joy. (Applause.)
I know a little something about that commitment to people. I was born in West Point, Nebraska. I lived in Butte, a small town of 400, where community was a way of life. Growing up, I spent the summers working on the family farm. My mom and dad taught us: Show generosity towards your neighbors and work for a common good. (Applause.)
My dad served in the Army during the Korean War, and with his encouragement, at 17, I joined the Army National Guard. (Applause.) For 24 years, I proudly wore the uniform of this nation. (Applause.) The National Guard gave me purpose, it gave me the strength of a shared commitment to something greater than ourselves, and just as it did for my dad and millions of others, the G.I. Bill gave me a shot at a college education. (Applause.)
My dad was a teacher; my brothers and sisters and I followed in their footsteps. (Applause.) Three out of four of us married teachers -- (applause) -- what we do. For nearly 20 years, I had the privilege of teaching high school social studies and coaching football -- (applause) -- including winning that state championship. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Don't ever close the yearbook. Don't ever.
But it was my students -- they encouraged me to run for office. They saw in me what I was hoping to instill in them: a commitment of common good, a belief that one person can make a difference. So, in 2006 -- (applause) -- in 2006, I took a leap, and I ran for Congress. (Applause.) And because high school teachers are super optimistic, I was running in a district that had one Democrat since 1892. (Laughter.)
Well, my neighbors graced me with an opportunity to represent them in the United States House of Representatives. (Applause.) I'm proud of the work we did there together. I worked across the aisle on veterans issues, on agriculture, and on ways to grow rural economies. I learned the art of compromise without compromising my values. (Applause.)
And now as governor the great state of Minnesota, I bring those experiences to bear in tackling the challenges that are facing our great state. Minnesota's strengths comes from our values, our commitment to working together, to seeing past our differences, to always being willing to lend a helping hand. Those are the same values I learned on the family farm and tried to instill in my students. I took it to Congress and to the state capitol, and now Vice President Harris and I are running to take those very values to the White House. (Applause.)
Now, Donald Trump sees the world a little differently than us.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: First of all, he doesn't know the first thing about service. (Applause.) He doesn't have time for it because he's too busy serving himself. (Applause.) Again and again and again, Trump weakens our economy to strengthen his own hand. (Applause.) He mocks our laws, he sows chaos and division, and that's to say nothing of his record as president. (Applause.)
He froze in the face of the COVID crisis, he drove our economy into the ground, and make no mistake, violent crime was up under Donald Trump. (Applause.) That's not even counting the crimes he committed. (Applause.)
You know --
AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
GOVERNOR WALZ: -- some of us --
AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
GOVERNOR WALZ: -- some of us are --
AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
GOVERNOR WALZ: Some of us -- some of us in here are old enough to remember. I see you down there. (Laughter.) I see those old white guys. (Laughter.) Some of us are old enough to remember when it was Republicans who were talking about freedom. It turns out now what they meant was the government should be free to invade your doctor's office.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: In Minnesota, we respect our neighbors and their personal choices that they make. Even if we wouldn't make the same choice for ourselves, there's a golden rule: Mind your own damn business. (Applause.)
These guys are after my heart, chanting ""Mind your own damn business."" That feels good, so thank you.
Look, that includes IVF, and this gets personal for me and my family. (Applause.) When my wife and I decided to have children, we spent years going through infertility treatments, and I remember praying every night for a call for good news, the pit in my stomach when the phone rang, and the agony when we heard that the treatments hadn't worked. So, it wasn't by chance that when we welcomed our daughter into the world, we named her Hope. (Applause.)
When the vice president and I talk about freedom, we mean the freedom to make your own health care decisions -- (applause) -- and for our children to be free to go to school without worrying they'll be shot dead in their classrooms. (Applause.)
By the way, as you heard, I was one of the best shots in Congress. But in Minnesota, we believe in the Second Amendment, but we also believe in commonsense gun violence laws. (Applause.)
Vice President Harris's idea of freedom is a ticket for education to be that ticket to the middle class, not crippling debt -- (applause); air that's clean, water that's pure, communities that are safe -- (applause); a place where we settle our political differences not through violence but with our votes. (Applause.) And that's what this election is about: What direction will this country go in?
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Freedom! (Applause.)
GOVERNOR WALZ: We're not going back. Well, Donald Trump would damn sure take us backwards, let's be clear about that.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: And don't believe him when he plays dumb. He knows exactly what Project 2025 will do to restrict our freedoms -- (applause) -- to rig the economy to help the super-rich.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: If Trump gets a chance to return, he's going to pick up exactly where he left off four years ago --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: -- only this time it will be much, much worse: raising costs on middle-class family. He will repea- -- repeal the Affordable Care Act, no doubt about it.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: He'll gut Social Security and Medicare.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: And when somebody tells who they are, they -- believe them. He said he would ban abortion across this country, and he'll do it whether or not Congress is there or not.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: Donald Trump is not fighting for you or your family.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You are!
GOVERNOR WALZ: He never s- -- he never sat at that kitchen table, like the one I grew up at, wondering how we were going to pay the bills. He sat at his country club up in Mar-a-Lago, wondering how he can cut taxes for his rich friends. (Applause.)
And I got to tell you, his running mate shares his dangerous and backward agenda for this country. (Applause.) J.D. Vance literally -- literally wrote the foreword for the architect of the Project 2025 agenda.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, J.D. studied at Yale -- (laughter) -- had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then wrote a bestseller trashing that community. Come on. That's not what Middle America is.
And I got to tell you, I can't wait to debate the guy. (Applause.) That is if -- if he's willing to get off the couch and show up, so -- (laughter). You see what I did there?
Look -- (laughs) -- I got to tell you -- pointing out just an observation of mine that I -- that I made. I just have to say it. You know it, you feel it: These guys are creepy and, yes, just weird as hell. That's what you see. (Laughs.) (Applause.) That's what you see.
So, you know what's out there, so say it with me: We aren't going back.
AUDIENCE: We aren't going back!
GOVERNOR WALZ: We aren't going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
GOVERNOR WALZ: We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
GOVERNOR WALZ: So, we got 91 days. My God, that's easy. (Laughter.) We'll sleep when we're dead. (Applause.)
Over those next 91 days and every day in the White House, I'll have Vice President Harris's back -- every single day. (Applause.) And we'll have yours. (Applause.)
You know how this works. We can't do it alone. We need you, each and every one of you. (Applause.) Go over to KamalaHarris.com, get on board, because we need you.
Freedom to make our own choices -- this leader -- this compassionate, careful, joyous leader -- believes in each and every one of you. (Applause.)
My God, you came here tonight to sit at the very top because you love this country and you're not going back. (Applause.)
She believes in the opportunity for every single person to join the middle class. She believes in the promise of America.
We just got to fight. We just got to fight, because as soon-to-be-President Harris says, when we fight --
AUDIENCE: We win!
GOVERNOR WALZ: -- we win. (Applause.)
Thank you, Philadelphia. Thank you, Vice President. God bless America. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President with Governor Walz at a Campaign Event in Detroit, Michigan
  


  

  
    August 07, 2024  

  
    GOVERNOR WALZ: Wow. (Applause.) Woo! Wow. Wow. (Applause.) Thank you.
A big thank you to Adam. I think we can all agree, our future is pretty bright. Thank you, Adam. (Applause.)
And hello, Michigan! (Laughs.) (Applause.)
You know, we -- we Minnesotans -- you probably know this -- we're a -- we're a stoic people, a people of few words. (Laughter.) But holy hell, can you throw a party here in Michigan, so -- (applause). Wow.
I want to take a moment to acknowledge a few friends, folks that I've gotten to know. And let's be very clear, this is someone who I consider my dearest friend and someone who taught all the other governors how to fix the damn roads: Governor Whitmer. (Applause.) You have got a treasure in Michigan, and -- and I'll tell you what, we share a lot between us in the Upper Midwest. We share --
Oh, we need some water. We have somebody down. We need some water. Medic. We need a medic right here. You got somebody here. You got him? All right. We got a medic on the way.
Thank you for caring for your neighbors. (Applause.) Thank you for showing what Michigan does.
Look, we share a lot of things. That's one of them. We're neighbors, and we're not weird, that's for sure. But -- (applause) -- but I got to tell you, something else we share is a care for the incredible natural resources. We in the Upper Midwest, in our states, we care for 20 percent of the world's fresh water in those Great Lakes. (Applause.) And the -- the Great Lakes have no better friend than your senator, Senator Stabenow. (Applause.)
I got some members of Congress I had the privilege of serving with and some that are new to that place. Let's be clear, we got to put gavels in the hands of these Democratic representatives so that we can get some work done. (Applause.)
My friend Dan Kildee; Debbie Dingell; Haley Stevens; Elissa Slotkin; Hillary Scholten -- (applause); Representive Thanedar, I believe, just won a -- in a primary year; Wayne County Executive Warren Evans; and the chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, Lavora Barnes -- thank you. (Applause.)
And I want to just take a moment. It's been a pretty interesting 24 hours for me, I'll have to be honest. (Applause.) And I -- I don't know what it -- how I could explain to you walking into that arena in Philly or that field out in Wisconsin or right here to what I have been told is the largest rally of the campaign in here. (Applause.)
And look -- and look, this is a place full of working folks, students, folks who care. And I -- think about this, you came out here early, found a place to park, stood in the sun, sat here and wait, and you did it. You did it for one simple and eloquent and beautiful reason: You love this country. (Applause.) You love this country.
I couldn't be prouder to be on this ticket and to help make Kamala Harris the next president of the United States. (Applause.) Every day of her life, Vice President Harris fights for the American people. She's taken on predators, fraudsters, and transnational gangs. You heard it. She stood up to powerful corporate interests, and she has never hesitated to reach across the aisle to try and find some common solutions.
And she has done it, and this is what we know: All the things that make me mad about those other guys and all the things they do wrong, the one thing that I will not forgive them for is they're trying to steal the joy from this country. They try and steal the joy. (Applause.)
But you know what? You know what? Our next president brings the joy. She emanates the joy. (Applause.)
I know a little something about that commitment to people. I was born in a small town of 400 people in Nebraska, and community was the way of life. My mom and dad taught me you showed generosity to your neighbors and you worked for a common good amongst them.
At 17, I joined the Army National Guard. (Applause.) And for the next 24 years, it was a privilege to wear the uniform of this country, and -- (applause) -- and just as it did for my dad, a Korean War-era veteran, and millions of others, I used the G.I. Bill to get a college education. (Applause.)
Followed a bit in my dad's footsteps -- he was a teacher. (Applause.) My brothers and sisters were teachers. (Applause.) And they married teachers. (Applause.)
I had the privilege of teaching high school social studies -- (applause) -- and I coached the football team. (Applause.) We did win a state championship. I tell you that because ""don't ever close the yearbook"" is my pro tip to you. (Laughter.)
My students are the ones who encouraged me to run for office. I never thought much about it. But they saw -- they saw in me what I hope to instill in them: a commitment to the common good, a true belief that one person truly can make a difference -- can make a difference in the world. (Applause.)
I lived in a district where -- I didn't know this at the time -- only one other Democrat since 1892 had won that district. And on that election night, my neighbors graced me with the opportunity to go to the United States Congress and represent them. (Applause.)
I learned how to compromise without compromising my values. I learned how to work across the aisle to get good things done for people. And now as governor of Minnesota, I bring those experiences together so we can tackle some of those hard problems: inequities, climate change, all of the things that we care about. (Applause.)
Now, we got a lot of shared values in this room. By the way, is labor in the room? (Applause.) This might be my chance to use it.
AUDIENCE: UAW! UAW! UAW!
GOVERNOR WALZ: Yeah! (Claps.)
AUDIENCE: UAW! UAW! UAW!
GOVERNOR WALZ: We know who built the middle class, but here's the deal. What we know is, Donald Trump -- he sees the world a bit differently than we see the world. And I've been saying it: He doesn't know the first thing about service,
because he's way too busy serving himself. This is a big difference.
Again and again, he does things that weakens our country only to strengthen his own hand. He mocks our laws, he sows chaos and division amongst the public, and that's to say nothing about his record as president. That --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) (Laughter.)
GOVERNOR WALZ: He is that. He is that.
Look, we had the worst crisis of a generation, and he froze during COVID. (Applause.) People lost their lives because of that. He drove the economy into the ground. And make no mistake, violent crime was up during Donald Trump's presidency. (Applause.) And that's not even counting the crimes he committed, so -- (applause).
Some of the -- some of the gray-hairs in here remember a Republican Party that used to actually talk about freedom. These guys, when they talk about freedom, it means the government has the freedom to invade your exam room with your doctor.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: Now, I know -- look, that -- we got a lot of commonalities. And I'll say this: As an NFC North guy, Vikings fans are proud of the Lions. I will say that. (Laughs.) I will say that. (Applause.)
But in Minnesota, we respect our neighbors' personal choices. We may not agree with them or make them from ourself, but I've been saying this -- you all know it -- our golden rule is: Mind your own damn business. Just mind your own business. (Applause.) It's amazing what minding your own damn business does to make things work better. (Applause.)
Don't like a book? Don't read it. (Laughter and applause.)
Is there anybody in America sitting around in a bar, a bunch of people talking and say, ""You know what we need in this country? We need to ban 'Animal Farm.' That's the first thing that you can do."" Nobody says that. (Laughter.)
But you know what? It would be funny if it wasn't so dangerous, because then they start thinking about things like IVF and banning IVF.
And I have to tell you, this is very personal for my family. When my wife and I decided to have children, we went through years of fertility treatments. I remember every time the phone rang, I'd catch my breath, I'd feel nervousness, and then it would be a crushing feeling when they told us that the treatments didn't work. The agony of that I can feel to this day.
But I can also feel some joy in this, because it wasn't by chance, as I say this, when our daughter -- and we finally conceived -- and our daughter was born, we didn't hesitate at all. We named her Hope. We named her Hope. (Applause.)
But I do have to tell you something about hope -- my wife always tells me this: It's not a damn plan. We can't hope we beat this guy. We can't hope that things get better. We go out and work our butts off to make sure it happens. (Applause.)
So, when our next president walks out here and she talks about freedom, she means the freedom to make your own health care decisions. (Applause.)
And when she comes out here and talks about that our children should be free to go to school without being shot dead in their classrooms. (Applause.) Look, we believe strongly in Minnesota in the Second Amendment, just like you do, but we also believe strongly in commonsense gun violence prevention law. (Applause.)
Freedom to an education is a ticket to the middle class, not crushing student loan debt. (Applause.)
And it's a place where we know freedom means we settle our political differences not through violence but with our votes. (Applause.)
You get it. You -- you drove out here --
AUDIENCE: Vote! Vote! Vote!
GOVERNOR WALZ: Yeah! (Claps.)
AUDIENCE: Vote! Vote! Vote!
GOVERNOR WALZ: Please. Look, and -- and let's all decide right now on this, or whatever. We know it's going to be hard race. We know it's going to be close, but let's don't be so close that these guys have anything to say. Let's don't be so close that they're going to come -- let's just win the damn thing by a broader margin. (Applause.)
Simple proposition: This election is about which direction this country is going to go in. We know Donald Trump is taking us backwards. And don't believe the act -- he's playing dumb --he knows exactly what Project 2025 is going to do to our personal liberties.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: Destroy unions, rig the economy for the ultra-wealthy.
We know that when he goes back, he's picking up and doing the same things he did when he was there the last time, except -- except -- you all know this -- it will be much, much worse when he comes back: raising costs for all of you, repealing the Affordable Care Act -- he doesn't care -- gutting Social Security. And be very clear: They can say whatever they want, they are banning abortion across this country. No questions asked. No questions asked.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: Yeah, you think this guy -- you think this guy cares about you or your family?
AUDIENCE: No!
GOVERNOR WALZ: His running mate has the same dangerous and backward agenda as Trump.
Well, heck, you all know it. Every -- every regular person in the heartland went to Yale -- (laughter) -- had -- had Silicon Valley billionaires fund his career. And then he writes a book trashing the very community that raised him.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: That old thing is, ""I wasn't calling anybody names. I was just making an observation about them."" We can see it.
And here's my thing, there's a lot of things going to happen, by the way. We've got about 91 days. And I keep telling people this: 91 days. My God, you can do anything for 91 days.
AUDIENCE: Ninety!
GOVERNOR WALZ: Ninety? Christ, I haven't slept in 24 hours. (Laughter.) You know -- you know why? We'll sleep when we're dead. We'll sleep when we're dead. (Applause.)
Here's my -- here's my brass ring I'm looking for: I can't wait to debate this guy. I cannot wait to talk about what they think. (Applause.) I can't wait to ask him why he wants to take health care and take reproductive rights and why he wants to make sure that the wealthiest pay no taxes as we destroy unions and the middle class.
So, here's the deal. You said it. These ideas that they're putting out there, they are weird as hell. No one is asking for it. No one is asking for it. (Applause.)
We're asking a fair shot. We're asking for health care and childcare. We're asking for an education. We're asking for safety in our streets. That's what we're asking for. (Applause.) And we're going to get it, because that's what this campaign is about. It's about moving forward. (Applause.)
Look, you know that Kamala Harris believes that you should be making the own choices in your life. She believes that every person should have an opportunity to enter the middle class. She believes in something so beautiful and simple with joy: She believes in the promise of this great nation. (Applause.)
Look, she can take care of herself out front, and she said it. If they want to talk smack, she said it: ""Say it to my face, damn it. Say it to my face."" (Applause.)
But what I got to say is, we got to have her back. We got to have her back. (Applause.) So, Madam Vice President, thank you for the trust you placed in me.
Michigan, help me right now give a warm Midwest welcome to the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris. (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good evening, Detroit! (Applause.) Good evening. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
We got this. We're going to do this. We are doing this. We are doing this. (Applause.)
Thank you, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, thank you, thank you.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay, come on. We've got thi- -- we've got business to handle. We've got business to handle. (Applause.)
Good evening, everybody. (Applause.) Good evening, good evening, good evening.
Can we hear it up for Tim Walz? (Applause.) Isn't he amazing? He's going to be the most incredible vice president. (Applause.)
All right. So, it is good to be back and to be with so many incredible leaders. I love you. (Applause.)
Governor Gretchen Whitmer, thank you for your -- (applause) -- thank you for your friendship, your sisterhood, and your leadership. And we are going to do this together. (Applause.)
Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist, thank you so much. (Applause.) His parents are over there.
And the members of Congress, including Senator Debbie Stabenow, my dear friend. (Applause.)
And your next United States Senator, Representative Elissa Slotkin. (Applause.) We're going to get that done.
Mayor Mike Duggan, thank you for the warm welcome always.
And, of course, it is so good to be with the president of the United Auto Workers, my dear friend, Shawn Fain. (Applause.)
And last year -- last week, it was my honor -- it feels like last year -- (laughter) -- last week, it was my great honor to accept the endorsement of the United Auto Workers. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: UAW! UAW! UAW!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And the UAW has always worked to lift up the working people of our nation.
Do we need some help over there? I need -- we need a medic over there, please. There should be medics in each corner.
We're good? Okay. All right. Look, let's all take care of each other and look f- -- look out for each other, all right? (Applause.) That's who we are. We look out for each other.
Okay. So, as I said to Shawn -- (applause) -- as I talked to Shawn about this, this election is going to be a fight. We like a good fight. (Applause.)
When you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. We know what we stand for. (Applause.)
So, I'm so proud to have UAW by my side, because you all know how to fight and you know how to win. (Applause.)
Today, I also bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Joe! Joe! Joe!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. Joe.
ADUIENCE: Joe! Joe! Joe!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. (Claps.)
AUDIENCE: Joe! Joe! Joe!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I know we are all deeply, deeply grateful to Joe for his lifetime of service to our nation. And we thank you, Joe Biden, each and every day for all you are and all you still have yet to do. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Joe.
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. I'm going to tell him what you said. (Laughs.)
So, Michigan, this has been a big week. (Applause.) On Monday, I officially became the Democratic nominee for president of the United States. (Applause.) And yesterday, I announced my running mate in this campaign, Governor Tim Walz. (Applause.)
And as you just heard, he has an incredible record as governor of the great state of Minnesota. And to those who know him best -- some people are just getting to know him, but I'm going to tell you, you got to know him real quick, because he's incredible. He's a serious, serious man. He has been a serious leader, and he loves our country.
And, you know, I've talked to some of the people who know him best, like his wife, Gwen. And to Gwen, Tim Walz is husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is dad. To his fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz. (Applause.) To the people of southern Minnesota, for 12 years, he was a congressman. (Applause.) To his former high school students, he is Mr. Walz. (Applause.) And to his former high school football players, he was Coach. (Applause.)
And in 90 days, the nation will know Coach Walz by the title ""vice president of the United States."" (Applause.) That's right.
So, it is so good to be back in Michigan. And listen, I am clear: The path to the White House runs right through this state. (Applause.) And with your help, we will win in November. We will win. (Applause.)
And I know we are all clear about what we are up against.
As many of you know, before I was elected vice president, before I was elected as a United States senator, I was elected attorney general and, before that, elected district attorney -- and, before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. (Applause.)
In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, scammers who broke the rules for personal gain.
So, hear me Detroit when I say: I know Donald Trump's type. (Applause.) I've been dealing with them my whole career.
For example, as attorney general of California, I took on one of the country's largest for-profit colleges that scammed students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students. You remember that?
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: As a prosecutor, I specialized in cases of sexual abuse. Well, Donald Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: As attorney general, I held the big Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Well, Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud -- 34 counts, to be exact.
AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hold on, hold on, hold on. You know what? Here -- hold on. Here's the thing. The courts are going to handle that. We're going to beat them in November. (Applause.) We're going to beat him in November, okay? We'll beat him in November. We'll handle that.
But all that to say, in this campaign, I proudly put my record against his any day of the week -- (applause) -- any day of the week.
But make no mistake, our campaign -- this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. It's bigger than that. It is about two very different visions for the future of our nation -- one, ours, focused on the future and the other focused on the past.
And, Michigan, we -- we here fight for the future. (Applause.) We fight for the future. We fight for a future where every worker has the freedom to join a union -- (applause); where every senior can retire with dignity -- (applause); a future with affordable housing, affordable childcare, affordable health care, and paid leave -- (applause); a future where we build a broad-based economy where every American has an opportunity to own a home, to start a business, and to build wealth. (Applause.)
And understand, in this fight, we are joyful warriors -- (applause) -- because while fighting for a brighter future may take hard work, we all here know hard work is good work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work.
We believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America's families so they have a chance not just to get by but to get ahead. (Applause.) Because, look, while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it, and I know it.
When I was attorney general, I went after price-fixing schemes. And when I am president, it will be my day one priority to fight to bring down prices -- (applause); to take on the big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging -- (applause); take on corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families -- (applause); to take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. (Applause.) That is the work we will do together.
And all of this to say, unlike Donald Trump, I will always put the middle class and working families first -- (applause) -- because Coach Walz and I know the middle class built this great country of ours, and when the middle class is strong, America is strong. (Applause.)
And, look, as we move our nation forward, Donald Trump intends to take our nation backward. Just look at his Project 2025 agenda -- Project 2025.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And please do check out Project 2025, because I'm telling you, it is a plan -- it is a plan to weaken America's middle class. Project 2025, if he is elected --
AUDIENCE: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's all good. It's all good. I'm here because we believe in democracy. Everyone's voice matters. But I am speaking now. (Applause.) I am speaking now.
So, Project 2025 -- look, if he is elected, Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to surrender our fight against the climate crisis. And he intends to end the Affordable Care Act.
You know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I'm speaking. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Inaudible.) We're not going back. We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we're not going back because we know what that would look like. And, again, understand: Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act and take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions.
We all remember what that looked like, and we're not going back. (Applause.) We're not going back. Our fight is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom. (Applause.)
Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on attack on hard-fought, hard-won fundamental freedoms and rights, and we will not stand for it. (Applause.) Attacks on the freedom to vote, attacks on the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride -- (applause) -- and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
Generations -- generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Now the baton is in our hands, each and every one of us. (Applause.) So, we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. (Applause.)
We who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban, universal background checks, and red flag laws. (Applause.) We who believe in the freedom to organize will pass the PRO Act and put an end to union-busting once and for all. (Applause.)
And we who believe in reproductive freedom will fight for a woman's right to choose -- (applause) -- remembering what Donald Trump did to pick three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would take away this freedom, and they did as he intended.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We who are paying attention to the fact that now over 20 states in our country have a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest. And we all know, if he wins, he would sign a national abortion ban to outlaw abortion in every state, and that would include the great state of Michigan. (Applause.) But we're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on that point, it is because there is a thing about who we are that is a bit different from the folks on the other side. We trust women to know what is in their best interests -- (applause) -- and not have their government telling them what to do.
And when I am president of the United States and Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedoms, I will sign it into law. (Applause.)
So, Michigan, here's the thing. So much -- so much -- so much is on the line in this election. (Applause.) And we got to remember, you know, we -- we knew -- we knew who he is and what he was about in '16 and in '20. But there's also something else that has happened recently that we really have to prioritize in our mind about the danger we're looking at.
Last month, the United States Supreme Court basically just told the former president, who has been convicted of fraud, that going forward, he will be immune no matter what he does in the White House.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But think about that. Think about that. Think about what that means. Think about what that means. The man has openly vowed, if reelected, that he will be a dictator on day one.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Think about what that means when he said that he will even, quote, ""terminate"" the Constitution of the United States.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Because let us be very clear: Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. (Applause.) Never again.
AUDIENCE: Vote! Vote! Vote!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Vote. Vote.
AUDIENCE: Vote! Vote! Vote!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Vote. That's right. So, here's the thing. To your point, when it comes down to all of the things that are important about this, I think the most important thing --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you, Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I love you back. (Applause.)
And -- listen, one of the things that I know brings us all out today and always is we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country. We love our country.
And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. That is how we preserve the promise of America.
After all, the promise of America -- think about it -- is what makes it possible for Tim Walz and me to be together on this stage today. (Applause.) Think about it. Think about that. Two middle class kids. One a daughter of Oakland, California -- (applause) -- who was raised by a working mother -- I had a summer job at McDonald's. The other, a son of the Nebraska plains who grew up working on a farm.
Only in America is it possible for them together to make it all the way to the White House. (Applause.) Only in America. Only in America.
So, we are running this campaign on behalf of all Americans -- from red states to blue states, from the heartland to the coasts. And when elected, I promise you, we will govern on behalf of all Americans. (Applause.) I promise that.
So, I'll close with this. Michigan, ultimately, in this election, we each face a question. We each face a question. What kind of country do we want to live in? A country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law or a country of chaos, fear, and hate?
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And the beauty of our democracy -- the beauty of our democracy: We each have the power to answer that question. We each have the power to answer that question. (Applause.) The power is with the people. (Applause.)
So, in the next 90 days, we need you to use your power. (Applause.) We need you to knock on some doors. (Applause.) We need you to register folks to vote. (Applause.) We need you to organize and energize and mobilize -- (applause) -- and make your voices heard.
So, Michigan, I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.) Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.) Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.) Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.) And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight --
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win. (Applause.)
God bless you. And God bless the United States. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President with Governor Tim Walz at a Campaign Event in Eau Claire, Wisconsin
  


  

  
    August 07, 2024  

  
    GOVERNOR WALZ: Wow. (Applause.) Wow. Wow.
Hello, Eau Claire. (Applause.)
Isn't it good to have a candidate who can pronounce the name correctly, so -- (laughter and applause). Wow.
Les, thank you. Thank you for the introduction. More importantly, thank you for articulating what we know it means to live out here in the Midwest: Care for your neighbors, kindness. (Applause.)
I want to acknowledge a few people today.
Somebody who I have to tell you might be the kindest human being I have ever met: your governor, Tony Evers. (Applause.)
A dear friend of mine who I had a chance to serve with in the House of Representatives, an incredible senator: Tammy Baldwin. (Applause.)
The people's lawyer, your attorney general: Josh Kaul. (Applause.)
And someone who knows education is a foundation of everything: State Superintendent Jill Underly. (Applause.)
All the state and local officials are here, but I want to say -- a point of personal privilege on this -- I got a bunch of my family down here in the front, so -- (laughs). (Applause.) A coup- -- (applause) -- a couple of them -- a couple of them are Badgers too, by the way, so -- (applause).
And a real special thank you to everybody here. Looking out across here, look, you're busy people. You got things to do. It's a summer day. You had to walk two miles. I had nothing to do with that, by the way -- (laughter) -- nothing, so --
But you came here for one beautiful, simple reason: You love this country and this democracy. (Applause.)
I couldn't be prouder to be on this ticket to help make Kamala Harris the next president of the United States. (Applause.)
You know it: Vice President Harris is on the side of the American people. She took on predators, fraudsters, transnational gang members. She stood up against powerful corporate interests. And she never hesitated, not once, to reach across the aisle if it improved people's lives. (Applause.)
Being a Midwesterner too, I know a little something about commitment to people. I was born in a small town in Nebraska, where community meant everything. My mom and dad taught me to show generosity to my neighbors and work for a common good.
At 17, I joined the Army National Guard. (Applause.) For 24 years, I proudly wore the uniform of this nation. (Applause.) And -- and that service, just as it did for my dad, a Korean War-era veteran, and millions of others, I got the G.I. Bill, and it gave me a shot at a college education. (Applause.)
My dad was a teacher. My siblings were all teachers. (Applause.) And three of them married teachers. (Applause.) It's noble work. I had the privilege of teaching public school social studies and coaching football for 20 years. (Applause.)
And for all you Packer and Badgers fan, yeah, we did win a state championship, so -- (laughter and applause). It's what we do.
But it was my students who encouraged me to run for office. I never thought that much about it, but they saw in me what I was hoping to instill in them: this idea of a commitment to a better world, a common good, a belief that one single person can actually make a difference. (Applause.)
I lived in a red district, but my neighbors were kind enough and graced me with the opportunity to go to the United States House of Representatives for 12 years to represent them. (Applause.) I learned how to compromise without compromising my values. (Applause.)
And as governor of the great state of Minnesota, I brought all that experience -- (applause) --
Okay, okay. Are there Minnesotans in the house today? (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Tim! Tim! Tim!
GOVERNOR WALZ: -- bringing that experience to tackling the challenges that were facing our state. We don't shy away from challenges.
But I'll tell you what, Donald Trump -- he sees the world differently than we see it.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: He has no understanding of service because he's too busy servicing himself -- (laughter) -- again and again and again. Again and again and again, this guy weakens our country to strengthen his own hand. He mocks our laws, he sows chaos and division amongst the people, and that's to say nothing of the job he did as president.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: He froze in the face of COVID, and it cost people's lives.
AUDIENCE: Yes!
GOVERNOR WALZ: He drove the economy into the ground.
AUDIENCE: Yes!
GOVERNOR WALZ: And make no mistake about it, violent crime was up when Donald Trump was president. (Applause.)
Those of you who are a little older know this. Older Republicans used to talk about freedom. These guys today, it turns out that freedom to them means government should be free to invade your exam room with your doctor.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: Now, look, we're pretty neighborly with Wisconsin. We get our friendly battles. But in Minnesota, just like in Wisconsin, we respect our neighbors and the personal choices they make -- (applause) -- even if -- even if we wouldn't make the same choices for ourselves, because we know there's a golden rule: Mind your own damn business. Mind your own damn business. (Applause.)
I don't need you telling me about our health care, I don't need you telling us who we love, and I sure the hell don't need you telling us what books we're going to read. (Applause.)
And there's a very personal one for me, and that includes IVF. Some of you might have heard this. This is very personal for my wife and I. When Gwen and I decided to have children, we went through years of fertility treatments. And I remember each night praying that the call was going to come, and it was going to be good news. The phone would ring, tenseness in my stomach, and then the agony when you heard the treatments hadn't worked.
So, it wasn't by chance that when we welcomed our first child, our beautiful daughter, we named her Hope. (Applause.)
When Vice President Harris and I and everyone here talks about freedom, we mean the freedom to make your own health care decisions -- (applause) -- and for all of our little ones to be free to go to school without worrying about being shot dead in their classroom. (Applause.)
And just like Wisconsin, over in Minnesota, we believe in the Second Amendment, but we also believe in commonsense gun violence laws. (Applause.)
And just so you know, when I was in Congress, I was the top gun at the trap shoot three years in a ray [row]. I can outshoot them too. (Applause.) I can outshoot these guys.
Look, freedom is when --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Help!
GOVERNOR WALZ: Freedom is -- oh. Can we -- can we get somebody to help? Somebody's hot.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Somebody help her!
GOVERNOR WALZ: Somebody's hot. Can we get somebody to help?
You okay?
Drink some water, folks. It is hot out. Get somebody o- --
GOVERNOR WALZ: Thank you. (Applause.)
Can we get water?
AUDIENCE: They're so weird! They're so weird! They're so weird!
GOVERNOR WALZ: (Laughs.)
She's okay?
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you for helping!
GOVERNOR WALZ: Yeah.
Thank you all for helping. I'm grateful. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you all.
Take care of one another on this. This is -- this is why we gather. Look, it's hot. It is hot. I'll come again. They've got folks here. We'll -- we'll make sure it -- we're okay.
But I -- I have to tell you all again, I -- in all seriousness, to come and gather like this to talk about our freedoms, the ability to talk about what could be good -- and I have to say, this idea of caring for our neighbor in kindness and a hand up when somebody needs it or just the sense of that people go through things and to be able to be there when they need it, that's who we are. It's not about mocking. It's not name-callings and -- you see it amongst them. (Applause.)
(Claps.) Yay! Thank you all. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible) more water down there?
GOVERNOR WALZ: They do.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Someone up here needs one.
GOVERNOR WALZ: Thank you all. We're e- -- we're okay. He's going to -- we have someone down. They're treating him, they're getting him some water, and it's good. He's going to get up.
You guys need some water too? We'll ask them.
Teddy, can you see if they have some more water? That'd be great. Take care of your neighbors.
There we go. (Applause.) There we go. There we go.
All right. All right, folks. Hey, they're getting him taken care of. I -- we'll stay -- I don't want to be too lighthearted. I thought about doing the Minnesota Rouser, but I thought that might be too much over here on you. (Applause.)
Look, we'll get -- we'll get him taken care of.
You know what this is about. This is about when they talk about the freedoms that we heard, and freedom in education means that our teachers aren't saddled with crippling debt when they go into this -- the student loan debt. (Applause.)
And I'll tell you what a big part of this is: We settle our political differences not through violence but through our votes. (Applause.)
The question is pretty simple. This election is all about asking that question. Which direction will this country go in?
Donald Trump knows the direction he wants to take us. He wants to take it back. He wants to do the things that you saw. But be very clear. Don't believe him when he plays dumb. He knows exactly what he's talking about. He knows exactly what Project 2025 will do in restricting and taking our freedoms. He knows that it rigs the economy for the super rich.
If he gets a chance to go back to the White House, it will be far worse than it was four years ago -- (applause) -- raising costs for the middle class; refeating -- repealing the Affordable Care Act; gutting Social Security and Medicare, the very safety nets that protect people when they're down; and, of course, banning abortions across this country with or without Congress.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: This is where we talk to our neighbors. Donald Trump is not for you or your family.
And Trump's running mate shares those same dangerous and backward beliefs. You know, just like all of us in regular America, we -- we go to Yale and then we have our careers funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then you write a book about the place you grew up and you trash that place.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: Come on. That's not who Wisconsin is. That's not who Minnesota is. We're better than that. We're better than that. (Applause.)
One of the best parts of this job is going to be -- I can't wait until the debate, so -- (laughs). (Applause.)
Look, I -- I've done this enough and I know bullies. And I'm not a name-caller, but what I am is a teacher; I observe things. So, I want to tell you: What I observed and you've deserved about -- observed about these guys when you see them, that it's a very clear thing. Yes, they are creepy and -- and weird as hell. (Applause.) You see it. You see it.
This is not normal. This is not normal behavior. Nobody is asking for this crazy stuff.
So, I'll tell you what. You heard it from the vice president; you've heard her talk about this. We're sure the hell not going back. We're not going back. (Applause.) We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
GOVERNOR WALZ: We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
GOVERNOR WALZ: We damn sure aren't, but it's even more than that. This is a campaign about where we're going, and that's a future where everyone matters and everyone is included. (Applause.)
Kamala Harris, she believes in the freedom to make your own choices. She believes in opportunity for every single person to join the middle class. And she believes in the promise of America. (Applause.)
Thank you, Madam Vice President, for the trust that you've placed in me.
Wisconsin, please help me in giving a warm Midwest welcome to the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris. (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, Wisconsin! (Laughs.) (Applause.) Good afternoon.
Oh, it's good to be back. Good afternoon, everybody.
Can we hear it for Tim Walz? (Laughs.) (Applause.) Oh, I'm so happy to be running with him, let me tell you.
So, let me start by thanking Les. Your words, your leadership, your voice, it's so important, Les. Thank you for everything you are and everything you do for our country. (Applause.)
And it is good to be with so many incredible leaders, including the most magnificent, wonderful governor, Tony Evers. Every time I come to Wisconsin, Tony meets me on the tarmac. He's such an incredible human being. (Applause.)
I want to thank Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski -- (applause); chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, Ben Wikler -- (applause); and my dear, dear friend, Senator Tammy Baldwin. (Applause.) I served with Tammy when I was in the United States Senate, and I'm going to tell you, she was always, always, always fighting for the people of this state. And in November, we are going to re-elect her to the United States Senate. (Applause.)
And please give it up one more time for Wisconsin's own Bon Iver. (Applause.)
It's a good afternoon. It's a good afternoon.
And let me say, I also want to just -- I want to bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden. (Applause.) He loves Wisconsin. He loves Wisconsin. And I know we are all deeply grateful for his lifetime of service to our nation -- (applause) -- and for all he continues to do.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you, Joe!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's great.
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: There we go. That's right. I'm going to tell him what you said. (Laughter.)
So, Wisconsin, this has been a big week. (Applause.) On Monday, I officially became the Democratic nominee for president of the United States. (Applause.) And yesterday, I announced my running mate in this campaign, Governor Tim Walz. (Applause.)
And as you just heard -- and the Minnesotans here know -- Tim has an incredible record as governor of the great state of Minnesota. (Applause.)
And to those who know him best, Tim is more than a governor. To his wife, Gwen, he is a husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is Dad. To his fedel- -- fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz. (Applause.) To the people of Southern Minnesota, for 12 years, he was a congressman. (Applause.) To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz. (Applause.) And to his former high school football players, he was Coach. (Applause.) Coach.
AUDIENCE: Coach! Coach! Coach!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right.
And in 90 days, the nation will know Coach Walz by a new title: vice president of the United States of America. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: VP Walz! VP Walz! VP Walz!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. Oh, it really is good to be back in Wisconsin. (Laughter and applause.)
So, listen, let me tell you. I am clear: The path to the White House runs right through this state. (Applause.) And with your help, we will win in November. We are going to win. (Applause.) We are going to win.
And I've been here many times, as you all know, recently and even before. And many of you know, then, before I was elected vice president, before I was elected United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and, before that, an elected district attorney. (Applause.) And before that -- and before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. (Applause.)
So, in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, scammers who broke the rules for personal gain. So, hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump's type. (Applause.) (Laughs.) I know his type.
In fact, I've been dealing with people like him my whole career. (Applause.) For example, as attorney general of California --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, hold on. The cou- -- you know what, the courts are going to handle that part of it. (Laughter.) What we're going to do is beat him in November. (Applause.) (Laughs.)
So, I'll tell you, as attorney general, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges that scammed students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: As a prosecutor, I specialized in cases of sexual abuse. Well, Donald Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: As attorney general, I held the big Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. (Applause.) Well, Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud -- 34 counts. (Applause.)
So, in this campaign, I'll tell you: I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week -- (applause) -- any day of the week.
But let's make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. It's about two very different visions for our nation -- two very different visions: one, for us, focused on the future; the other focused on the past.
And, Wisconsin, we -- we here -- we fight for the future. (Applause.) We fight for a future where every worker has the freedom to join a union -- (applause); where --
AUDIENCE: Union strong!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Union strong.
AUDIENCE: Union strong! Union strong! Union strong!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We fight for a future where every senior can retire with dignity -- (applause); a future where we build a broad-based economy and one where every American has the opportunity to own a home, to start a business, to build wealth. (Applause.)
And understand, in this fight, as Tim Walz likes to point out, we are joyful warriors -- (applause) -- joyful warriors. Because we know that while fighting for a brighter future may be hard work, hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. (Applause.)
And so, we will continue to fight for affordable housing, for affordable health care, affordable childcare, and paid leave. (Applause.) We believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America's families so that they have a chance not just to get by but to get ahead -- (applause) -- because while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it, and I know it.
You know, when I was attorney general, I went after price-fixing schemes. And when I am president, it will be a day-one priority to fight to bring down prices. (Applause.) I will take on big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging. I will take on corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families. I will take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans -- (applause) -- and continue to bring manufacturing jobs back to America -- (applause) -- and back to communities like Eau Claire. (Applause.)
So, all this is to say: Strengthening our economy and building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. (Applause.) Because, you see, Coach Walz and I know when America's middle class is strong, America is strong. And as we work to move our nation forward, Donald Trump intends to take our nation backward.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: There is so much evidence of that point. There really is. But look at, most recently, Project 2025 and that agenda.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Project 2025 -- you know, if you have some time to take a look at it, I'm telling you, it -- it is a plan to weaken the middle class. It is a plan to weaken the middle class.
If he is elected, Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to surrender our fight against the climate crisis, and he intends to end the Affordable Care Act.
AUDIENCE: Noo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And because we all remember what it was like before the Affordable Care Act, we understand what that means. That's about taking us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember that --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- what that was like when -- we're not going back. We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are not going back.
But in order to know where we need to go, let's remember the past and what that was like, because we cannot forget.
On that point about the ACA, remember people with pre-existing conditions being denied -- children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes? That was no joke. And we cannot go back. Ours has to be a fight for the future and a fight for freedom -- (applause) -- a fight for freedom.
Across our nation, we have been witnessing a full-on assault against hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights: the freedom to vote; the freedom to be safe from gun violence; the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water -- (applause); the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride -- (applause); and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. (Applause.)
And let's remember -- let's remember the traditions of our great country. Generations of Americans before us led in the fight for freedom. And now, then, as they would expect, the baton is in our hands. The baton is in our hands, each and every one of us.
So, we, then, who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. (Applause.)
We who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass universal background checks, red flag laws, and an assault weapons ban. (Applause.)
We who believe in reproductive freedom will fight for a woman's right to choose. (Applause.) And we remember that when he was president, Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court -- the court of Thurgood and RBG -- because he intended for them to overturn Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And now more than 20 states in our country have a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And if he wins, we all know he will sign a national abortion ban to outlaw abortion in every state, even in Wisconsin.
AUDIENCE: Noo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But we are not going to let that happen.
AUDIENCE: No!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Because we trust women. (Applause.)
And when I am president of the United States and when Congress passes a bill to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade, I will sign it into law. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you all.
So, listen, everyone took time out of your busy lives and days and all your obligations to come out here and to be together as one community. (Applause.) And I know you did it also because we all know, listen, so much is on the line in this election. It can't be said seriously enough. So much is on the line.
And compounded with everything else that we knew was on the line, think about the fact that last month, the United States Supreme Court basically told the former president, who has been convicted of fraud, that, going forward, he will be immune no matter what he does in the White House.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Think about what that means and the changed circumstances since 16-6-20 when you think about what that court decision means. Donald Trump has openly vowed, if re-elected, he will be a dictator on day one --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- that he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- that he would round up peaceful protesters and throw them out of our country --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and even, quote, terminate the United States Constitution.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, let us be clear. Let us be clear. Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again have a chance to stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. (Applause.)
So, basically, I think it all comes down to this. We're all here because we love our country. We love our country. (Applause.) We love our country. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country.
And that's how we preserve the promise of America, because, after all, the promise of America is what makes it possible, by the way, for Governor Walz and me to stand on this stage today. Just think about it: two middle-class kids, one a daughter of Oakland, California, who was raised by a working mother -- (applause) -- and had a summer job at McDonald's -- (applause); the other, a son of the Nebraska plains who grew up working on a farm. (Applause.)
Think about that. Only in America is it possible for them together to make it all the way, together, to the White House. (Applause.) Only in America. Only in America. (Applause.)
So, this is a fight to make real the promise of America for every person in our nation. And, also, I'll tell you -- and I promise you, our campaign is going to reach out to everyone -- from red states, from blue states, from the heartland to the coast. We are running a campaign on behalf of all Americans. (Applause.) And when elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans. (Applause.)
Because Coach Walz and I know -- and we're clear about this, unlike the other side -- we work for you. (Applause.) We work for you, the American people, and we will always fight for you -- for your family, for your freedoms, and for your future.
So, Wisconsin, ultimately, this election is about a question that we each face. We each face a question in this election, and that is: What kind of country do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a country of freedom, of compassion, of rule of law --
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- or a country of chaos, fear, and hate?
AUDIENCE: Noo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And the beauty of our democracy is we each have the power -- individually and collectively, we each have the power in a democracy to answer that question. The power is with the people. The power is with the people. (Applause.)
So, in the next 90 days, we need you to use your power. (Applause.) We need you to knock on doors. We need you to register folks to vote. We need you to energize and organize and mobilize and make your voices heard. (Applause.)
And I'll tell you, about an hour ago, after I landed on Air Force Two, I -- I met a collection of young leaders from Girl Scout Troop 3307. Oh, they were spectacular. Oh, they were spectacular. None of them high- -- taller than three feet. They -- (laughter) -- I mean, just they were spectacular.
And one of those young leaders had a shirt on that said, ""You are powerful, and your voice matters."" (Applause.) Right? From the mouths of babes, they're telling us. They're telling us.
And so, let's remember that. Let's remember our power. Let's remember our voice matters.
And with that, then, I ask: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight --
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win!
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

    Vice President of the United States: 2021-2025
  
  

  
    Remarks by the Vice President with Governor Tim Walz at a Campaign Event in Wayne, Michigan
  


  

  
    August 08, 2024  

  
    GOVERNOR WALZ: Wow. (Applause.) Wow. Well, thank you, Mr. President. The American worker has no greater friend than you and your members. Thank you for what you do every single day. (Applause.)
And to the sisters and brothers here in this spot, as a union member, thank you for the privilege. This is holy ground for unions, Local 900. And to be here and know, for any union member understands what this place stands for and what it means. And so, thank you for having me here.
And to each and every one of you, thank you for the privilege of walking that picket line with you last year. Thank you for allowing us to lift up our voices.
And in Minnesota, the work that you did -- it didn't just benefit UAW workers, it benefited all workers. (Applause.)
So, I couldn't be prouder to be on this ticket and couldn't be prouder to stand with UAW. (Applause.)
Think about this: 89 wake-ups. I've been saying this. Eight-nine days -- we can do anything for 89 days. Telling people, ""Sleep when you're dead."" We got work to do. Right now -- (applause) -- right now, 89 days to make Kamala Harris the next president of the United States. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Yay.
Look --
AUDIENCE: We've got your back! We've got your back! We've got your back!
GOVERNOR WALZ: Yeah. Think -- think about -- think about this leader that's very simple. She stands on the side of the American people and the American worker. She's the one who took on the predators, the fraudsters, the transnational gangs. And she's the one that stands up against the billionaires and the corporate greed that bring -- that bring -- this is who it is. (Applause.)
And she has a long record of delivering for union -- union members and organized labor.
All right. Everybody in this room knows -- and I keep saying this. This is a bit of preaching to the choir, but the choir needs to sing right now. (Applause.) The choir needs to sing.
We know -- we know that unions built the middle class. The rest of America has to.
You know who doesn't believe that? Donald Trump. He sees the world entirely differently. And it really starts with this, when I look at community and neighbors and unions. And the word that Shawn said, ""unity"" -- this guy doesn't know the first thing about unity or service. He's too busy serving himself.
Again and again and again you've seen it. He put himself above us. He weakened our country to strengthen his own hand. He mocks our laws. He sows chaos and division. That says nothing about how he dealt with as president. We lived through it. We lived through it.
He froze in the face of COVID, and our neighbors died because of it. And by doing nothing about COVID, he drove this economy into the ground.
And I want to be very clear about this, because there's a lot of lies that happened when they're here. Violent crime was up when Donald Trump was president. Without even counting his crimes, it was still up. It was still up. (Laughter and applause.)
So, this is very simple. You know it, and it's going to take a heck of a lot of hard work, but this election is a simple choice: What direction and what's our country going to look like? What direction are we going in?
You know it. We've said it. Donald Trump is going to take it backwards.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We're not going back!
GOVERNOR WALZ: He's going to -- we aren't going back. We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
GOVERNOR WALZ: It isn't happening. We're not going back.
(Addressing Shawn Fain.) They know.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
GOVERNOR WALZ: Look, and this thing of -- of playing dumb while he sits on the planes with these billionaires and says he do- -- ""I don't know anything about Project 2025. I just fly on the planes with them.""
You know what it's going to do. One of the goals of that, plain and simple -- and they know this; this has been going on forever -- get rid of labor unions and get rid of the voices that we bring. They can do whatever the hell they want then.
If Trump's -- returns, he's going to learn something from the last time. He didn't get the job done. This time, it will be far, far worse, and he will get the job done and make sure that we can't organize collectively to improve our lives. That's what is coming.
So, whether he cuts the middle class, makes it more difficult to own a home, whether he repeals the Affordable Care Act so you can't get health insurance are the things that you know they talk about -- gutting Social Security and Medicare.
You know what? When you got a billion dollars, you don't give a damn about your Social Security check. But if you're like my mom and you depend on the Social Security check as your sole income, it's pretty damn important. (Applause.)
And I've been saying it and you've been hearing me say it: They will ban abortion across this country no matter what Congress says.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My body, my choice!
GOVERNOR WALZ: Now look -- damn right, it is. And I don't know why this is so simple -- or so difficult for these people to understand.
You know how things work really well in life and really well with your neighbors and really well in communities? When you mind your own damn business, things work better. (Applause.) Stay out of our business. Stay out of our business.
He's not fighting for you. He doesn't know you. He doesn't care about your family. And his running mate is just as dangerous and backward as he is.
So, look, we know who they are. The choir is ready to sing. This campaign is about the future -- your future. Vice President Harris sure knows that. She grew up in a middle-class family. She goes to work every day making sure families are on the front so that they can get ahead and they can get into the middle class.
She believes in something so simple and so beautiful. And when we go to these rallies, I say it too. People drive, they sit in the sun, they get there, they stand next to their neighbor for one simple reason. And just like the vice president says, they believe in their hearts in the promise of America. They believe it. They believe it. (Applause.)
So, sisters and brothers in the UAW, how great is this going to be? Please join me in welcoming the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris. (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, UAW. (Applause.) Good afternoon. Good afternoon.
Oh, it is good to be in the house of labor. It is good to be in the house of labor. (Applause.)
Thank you, all. Please have a seat. Please have a seat.
Okay. So, let me just say, first of all, can we hear it again for Tim Walz? (Applause.) Isn't he spectacular?
You know, I have to tell -- people have been asking, ""Well -- well, what do you and Tim Walz have in common?"" And I said, ""Well, you know, a whole lot. A whole lot."" You know, we grew up the same way. We grew up in a community of people, you know -- I mean, he grew up in -- in Nebraska; me, Oakland, California -- (laughs) -- seemingly worlds apart.
But the same people raised us: good people; hard-working people; people who had pride in their hard work; you know, people who had pride in knowing that we were a community of people who looked out for each other -- you know, raised by a community of folks who understood that the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down. It's based on who you lift up. (Applause.)
GOVERNOR WALZ: Amen. Amen.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And, you know, there's some perversion that's happened in our country in the last several years where there's a suggestion that somehow strength is about making people feel small, making people feel alone. But isn't that the very opposite of what we know -- unions know to be strength?
It's about the collective. It's about understanding no one should ever be made to fight alone, that we are all in this together. (Applause.)
You know, you know why I fought my entire career for unions and labor? Because I understand the concept -- and the noble concept -- behind collective bargaining. And here it is. Here it is: fairness. Fairness. It's about saying, ""Hey, in a negotiation, don't we all believe the outcome should be fair?"" I mean, who could disagree with that? The outcome should be fair. It should be fair, right? (Applause.)
But when you're talking about the individual and a big company, and you're requiring that one individual to nego- -- negotiate against a big company --
GOVERNOR WALZ: Yeah.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- how's that outcome going to be fair?
So, collective bargaining is about saying: Let the collective come together around a common experience, which, at its core, is about dignity and the dignity of labor. (Applause.)
GOVERNOR WALZ: That's right.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And then let the people come together to negotiate so you make the balance, and then the outcome will be fair.
And isn't that what we're talking about in this here election? We're saying we just want fairness. We want dignity for all people. We want to recognize the right all people have to freedom and liberty, to make choices -- especially those that are about heart and home -- and not have their government telling them what to do. (Applause.)
Our campaign is about saying we trust the people, we see the people, we know the people. You know one of the things I love about our country? We are a nation of people who believe in those ideals that were foundational to what made us so special as a nation. We believe in those ideals.
And the sisters and brothers of labor have always fought for those ideals -- always fought for those ideals. And we know we are a work in progress. We haven't yet quite reached all of those ideals, but we will die trying because we love our country and we believe in who we are. (Applause.)
And that's what our campaign is about. We love our country. We believe in our country. We believe in each other. We believe in the collective. We're not falling for these folks who are trying to divide us, trying to separate us, trying to pull us apart. That's not where the strength lies.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And there is that. (Laughter.)
And so, I say to all the members of UAW -- and Shawn Fain is the first who I talked to about this -- I am so deeply honored, as a lifelong supporter of union labor, for Tim and I to have the endorsement of UAW. (Applause.) So deeply honored because you walk your walk -- you walk your walk.
And what we know -- like we have talked about, we got 89 days to get this done. You know, the one thing about all of us is we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work.
The thing that we like about hard work is we have fun doing hard work because we know what we stand for. And that's a big part of this campaign. You know, when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. (Applause.) We know what we stand for. And we stand for the people. And we stand for the dignity of work. And we stand for freedom. We stand for justice. We stand for equality. (Applause.)
GOVERNOR WALZ: That's right. That's right.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And so, we will fight for all of it.
And the bottom line about UAW is that I also know -- and I'll say to all the friends watching: Look, even if you're not a member of a union, you better thank unions -- (applause) -- for that five-day workweek. You better thank unions for that eight-hour workday. You better thank unions for that vacation time. (Applause.)
So, I'm here to say thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you to the sisters and brothers of UAW for all you are and all we will do over these next 89 days. (Applause.)
God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. We're going to get this done. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President with Governor Tim Walz at a Campaign Event in Glendale, Arizona
  


  

  
    August 09, 2024  

  
    GOVERNOR WALZ: Wow! (Applause.) Hey, he- -- hello, Arizona! (Laughs.) (Applause.) Wow. Hey --
AUDIENCE: Coach! Coach! Coach!
GOVERNOR WALZ: (Bows.) Yeah. Wow. Well, you might have seen, a few people showed up in Philadelphia the other night. (Applause.) And then 10,000-plus walked into a field in western Wisconsin. (Applause.) And then on Wednesday, the largest crowd of the campaign showed up in Detroit, Michigan. (Applause.)
But Arizona just couldn't leave it alone, could you? (Laughs.) (Applause.) Wow. You know, it's not as if anybody cares about crowd sizes or anything, so -- (laughter and applause). Wow.
Let me begin -- let me begin by giving a few thanks to some people here and a few dear folks to us.
First of all, I want to thank Arizona for sharing Senator Mark Kelly and Gabby Giffords with the rest of the country. (Applause.) Gabby was a classmate of mine in '06, and they are both national treasures. Thank you, Arizona. (Applause.)
I also had the privilege of serving with -- with Congressman Gallego. And I have to tell you -- (applause) -- he -- he was an amazing colleague. And I have to tell you, he's going to be an amazing senator, but we get it -- we -- we get -- (applause) -- we get a twofer with Ruben, because we know who is never going to be a United States senator. (Applause.)
To all the local elected officials, thank you. But the most important thank you to each and every one of you. (Applause.) Look, you took time out of your busy lives. You found babysitters; you took time off work. You walked for miles. And look, I'm a Minnesotan; I'm like a damn snowman. I'm melting here. (Laughter.) There's a -- we walk on water half the year in Minnesota, it's so damn cold. But -- but not you. You came. And you came into this space with neighbors. (Applause.)
And you came here for one beautiful, simple reason: You love this democracy. (Applause.) I'll - I'll tell you what --
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
GOVERNOR WALZ: Wow, wow, wow.
Well, I couldn't be prouder to stand with you, and I couldn't be prouder to be on this ticket. (Applause.)
You know what is at the end of this little journey? Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States. (Applause.)
This is a leader who wakes up every day on the side of the American people. This is -- (applause) -- she will take on the predators. She will take on the fraudsters, she will take on the transnational gangs, and she will stand up to the corporate interests and put middle America first. (Applause.)
And -- and she's been effective. She's been willing to reach across the aisle no matter what just to make sure it improves people's lives.
And I'll have to tell you, I know a little something about commitment to people. Some of you heard this. I was born in a small town in Nebraska. And we talk about small towns. (Applause.) These are those Nebraskans that moved out here for the winter, so -- (laughter).
But, look, small town was all about community. My mom and dad, they taught us to show some care to your neighbors, show some generosity, work towards a common good, be a decent human being to your neighbors. (Applause.)
My dad -- and some of you know him in here; you had him -- a chain-smoking, Korean War-era veteran, cared about his community. But two days after I turned 17, he took me down to join the Army National Guard. And for 24 years, I proudly wore that uniform. (Applause.)
And I'm proud of that service, but what my nation gave my dad and millions of others and me was an opportunity to use the G.I. Bill to get a college education. (Applause.)
My dad was a teacher. My brothers and sisters and I -- (applause) -- my brothers and sisters and I all became teachers. (Applause.) And we married teachers. (Applause.)
I had the privilege of teaching high school social studies for 20 years -- (applause) -- and, you might have heard, coaching a state championship football team. So --- (applause).
AUDIENCE: Coach! Coach! Coach!
GOVERNOR WALZ: Now if the Vikings could just win, that would be the -- (laughter) -- (inaudible). Well, look --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: (Laughs.) That worked better near Green Bay, I'll tell you. So -- (laughter) --
Look, it was my students -- it was my students who encouraged me to run. They saw in me what I hoped to instill in them: a commitment to a common good, the belief -- the true belief that one person, one of us in here, can make a difference in somebody's life. (Applause.)
I -- I wasn't very politically savvy, because I did not know it when I decided to run for Congress that there had been one other Democrat elected in that district since 1892. But my neighbors believed, and they graced me with an opportunity to serve them in the United States Congress for 12 years. (Applause.)
And I'm proud of the work I did as ranking member on the Veterans Affairs Committee, working on the Agriculture Committee. (Applause.) And I worked hand in hand with Republicans to make sure that we were crafting legislation that improved the lives of veterans and people all across this country. (Applause.)
I learned how to compromise without compromising my values. (Applause.)
And as governor of the great state of Minnesota, I brought all of those experiences -- I brought all of those experiences to the challenges facing the state of Minnesota. (Applause.)
This idea about a common good, this idea about something bigger than ourselves, this idea of kindness, generosity and compassion that this building -- which I have been told, by the way, might be the largest political gathering in the history of Arizona. (Applause.)
I -- I think it's -- I think it's safe to say Donald Trump sees the world a little differently than we do.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: First and foremost -- and be very clear about this -- he doesn't know the first thing about service.
AUDIENCE: Nooo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: It's hard to provide service when you're too busy serving only yourself. (Applause.) Again and again and again, Donald Trump weakens our country to strengthen his own hands.
You've watched him mock our laws. You watched him sow chaos and division at every opportunity. And that's to say nothing of his record as president.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: As governors -- as governors, he froze during COVID and pitted us in a hunger game against our neighbors to try and find basic lifesaving needs. And because of him, our neighbors died.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: By failing to address COVID, he drove the economy into the ground.
And let's be very clear, the statistics and the facts are clear about this: Violent crime was up under Donald Trump. (Applause.) And we don't even have to count his crimes in that to make it up. So, still. (Applause.)
Look -- those --
AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
GOVERNOR WALZ: Better yet, beat the hell out of him at the ballot box. (Applause.) Beat the hell out of him at the ballot
box.
Look, you and I, especially the gray hairs in the crowd, we know -- we know our relatives. Republicans used to be the people talking about freedom. Not this group. When they talk about freedom, it means that the government should be free to invade your exam room with your doctor.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: Look, in Minnesota, we respect our neighbors and the personal choices they make. We may- -- we maybe wouldn't make the same choices, but we respect them. And I know in Minnesota and in Arizona and places across this country, you know what makes society work best -- is when you learn a golden rule: Mind your own damn business. Mind your own damn business. (Applause.) We don't need it.
I don't -- I don't need you telling me what books to read. I don't need you telling me about what religion we worship. And I sure the heck don't need you to tell me about my family. (Applause.)
Look, this -- this one is personal for me. This one is personal for me about IVF and reproductive care. When my wife and I -- my wife of 30 years, because, yes, we share family values; we just make our own damn choices about our family. (Applause.)
But when we wanted to have children, we went through years of fertility treatment. And I remember it was -- like it was yesterday, just waiting for good news. And then the phone would ring, and you would be tensed up. And then you would hear that the treatments had failed. It was a -- it would blot out the sun that you just wanted something so beautiful and so simple to have a child.
And then, one day -- and it wasn't by chance when that news came and we welcomed our daughter into the world -- (applause) -- we named her Hope. We named her Hope. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Hope! Hope! Hope!
GOVERNOR WALZ: I'm not crying; you're crying. So -- (laughter).
When Vice President Harris and I talk about freedom, we're very clear. We mean the freedom to make your own health care decisions -- (applause) -- and for all of our children to be free to go to school without worrying they'll be shot dead in their classroom. (Applause.)
And in Minnesota, believe me, we believe in the Second Amendment, but we also believe in commonsense gun violence laws. (Applause.)
I remind my colleagues, when I was in Congress -- Ruben could tell this story -- for three years in a row, I was the top gun in the congressional trap shoot, so we can shoot better than them, too. Just, by the way, so -- (laughter).
When Vice President Harris talks about freedom, it's when freedom is when education is a ticket to the middle class -- (applause) -- not crippling student loan debt. (Applause.)
And this building and what we believe in -- we are people that settle our political differences not through violence but through voting. (Applause.)
It's a simple --
AUDIENCE: Vote! Vote! Vote!
GOVERNOR WALZ: Imagine every person in here is going to vote and every person in here is going to get 10 other people to vote, and here's -- (applause) -- and let's just go ahead and not go through this thing that it's so close. Let's just win big, people. Let's just win big. (Applause.)
That's our choice. How often -- how often you get a choice so simple that this is going to decide the direction of our country? We have 87 days to decide the direction we're going to go. And I've been saying it: We can do anything for 87 days. Anything. (Applause.)
And my mantra is -- and, look, you can see it on me over the last five days -- we'll sleep when we're dead. We'll sleep when we're dead. (Applause.) Not now. Not now.
Look, you know it and I know it, but I think we need to be reminded. You know exactly what Donald Trump's plans are. You know which direction he's taking us.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: Don't believe this guy. Don't believe -- I -- that's -- like, listen, no one in here believes this guy. So, anyway. (Laughter.) But don't believe it when he's playing dumb about this Project 2025.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: He knows exactly what it'll do. They are not playing. They wrote their plan out. But just like they're getting arrogant about it, they're saying the quiet stuff out loud. It'll take our freedoms. It will rig the economy for the super-rich. It will underfund veterans.
And you know that if he goes back again, he's not only going to let go where he left off, it is going to be much, much, much worse.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: So, look, rising costs, pulling health care from us -- you know, the whole routine.
Look, I get this too. I know I'm preaching to the choir -- a damn big and beautiful choir -- (applause) -- but practice is over, people. The choir needs to sing. The choir needs to sing. (Applause.)
Trump stopped fighting for your family. He doesn't give a damn.
And his running mate shares the same dangerous, twisted, backward agenda.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: Yeah. Ev- -- every kid -- every kid in my class of 25 studied at Yale, had their career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then writes a book trashing the very people who raised you.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: I've said it. It wasn't a name; it was an observation. These guys come up with the weirdest damn ideas that you will ever imagine. (Applause.) You know it's true.
But here's the good news. We know the stakes. We know who they are. When they told us, we believed them. We know what's coming. But here's the big thing about it is: That's a reality that's not going to happen because of the people in this building and millions across the country. (Applause.)
This is a campaign about the future. We know what's there. We know what can come. We're not people who are afraid of the future; we shape the future. (Applause.)
Kamala Harris believes in the freedom to make your own choices. She believes in the opportunity for every single person to enter the middle class. And she believes something so beautiful: She believes in the promise of America -- the promise of America. (Applause.)
So, I want to say thank you, Madam Vice President, for the trust you've placed in me. And I want to say something else that this incredible leader, this incredible woman has brought to this fight. (Applause.) She -- she has brought back compassion and decency and humor and joy to our politics. (Applause.)
So, Arizona -- Arizona, bring that joy with you. Bring those smiles. Bring that positive future as you join me in welcoming the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris.
(""Freedom"" by Beyoncé is played.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good evening, Arizona! (Applause.) Good evening. Oh, my goodness. Good evening. (Laughs.) (Applause.) We're going to do this. Good evening. Good -- (laughs) -- thank you all. Thank you.
Can we hear it for Tim Walz? (Applause.) Oh, my goodness. Oh, it's good to be back in Arizona. Good evening, everyone. (Applause.)
Oh, my goodness. Thank you all so very much. Oh, it is good to be back.
Let me just say -- let me -- let me just start by thanking everyone who is here. Thank you all so very much. (Applause.) All of us, we're going to do this. We're going to do this. We are going to do this. (Applause.) Yes, we are.
And I want to thank all of the incredible leaders who are here, including Congressman Greg Stanton -- (applause); your next United States senator, Congressman Ruben Gallego -- (applause); and my dear friend, United States Senator Mark Kelly. (Applause.)
And let me just say, as Arizona knows, Mark is an extraordinary leader who has dedicated his life to the service of our nation as a fighter pilot, as an astronaut, and as a member of the United States Congress. And he has given so much to our country. He always fights for the people of Arizona. And I am so grateful, Mark, for your friendship and your leadership. (Applause.)
And, of course, the -- a phenomenal congresswoman, Gabby Giffords. (Applause.)
There are also an incredible group of mayors with us today, Mayor Kate Gallego -- (applause); Mayor Corey Woods -- (applause); and Arizona co-chair of Republicans for Harris, Mayor John Giles. (Applause.)
So, today, I also bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Joe! Joe! Joe!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I know we are all deeply grateful for his lifetime of service to our nation. And we thank Joe Biden each and every day -- (applause) -- for all he is and all he has done and all he has yet to do. Let us thank him always. (Applause.)
So, Arizona, this has been a big week. (Applause.)
On Monday, I officially became the Democratic nominee for president of the United States. (Applause.)
And on Tuesday, I announced my running mate in this campaign, Governor Tim Walz. (Applause.)
And as you all just heard, Tim has a great record as governor of the great state of Minnesota. And to those who know him best, Tim goes by a few more titles besides governor.
To his wife, Gwen --
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Inaudible.)
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
So, Tim -- Tim, we know him by -- we know him by ""Governor,"" but you'll soon get to know his wife, Gwen, to whom --
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You know what? Hold on a second. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on, everybody. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Here's the thing: We are all in here together. I'm s- -- I'm told, an extraordinary number of folks who are here together because we love our country. We're here to fight for our democracy -- (applause) -- which includes respecting the voices that I think that we are hearing from.
And let me just say this on topic of what I think I'm hearing over there. Let me just speak to that for a moment, and then I'm going to get back to the business at hand. (Applause.)
So, let me say, I have been clear: Now is the time to get a ceasefire deal and get the hostage deal done. (Applause.)
done. Now is the time. And the president and I are working around the clock every day to get that ceasefire deal done and bring the hostages home. (Applause.)
So, I respect your voices, but we are here to now talk about this race in 2024. (Applause.)
So, Tim Walz -- so, let's just say this. Besides being governor, the thing I've come to learn about Tim Walz that you have known and may learn more: He's an extraordinary person.
He's known by many titles. To his wife Gwen, he is husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is Dad. To the people of Southern Minnesota for 12 years, he was Congressman. To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz. (Applause.) And to his former high school football players, he was Coach. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Coach! Coach! Coach!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And in 88 days, the nation will know Coach Walz by a new title: vice president of the United States. (Applause.)
So, it's so good to be back in Arizona, and I thank you all for turning out today. This is an extraordinary, extraordinary thing. (Applause.)
And, Arizona, I'll also this -- say this, as exciting as this is, we cannot lose sight of a really important fact: We are definitely running as the underdog. We are the underdog. We are out in great numbers, but we got a lot of work to do.
And this is going to be hard work, but I know we like hard work. Hard work is good work for all of us. Hard work is good work, and we will do it with joy. (Applause.)
And I know we are all clear about what we are up against. As many of you know, before I was elected vice president, I was an elected United States senator. (Applause.) Before that -- before that, I was an elected attorney general and, before that, an elected district attorney. (Applause.) And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. (Applause.)
So, I took on, in these roles, perpetrators of all kinds: predators who abused women --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- fraudsters who ripped off consumers --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- scammers who broke the rules for personal gain.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, Arizona, hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump's type. (Applause.) I do. In fact, I've been dealing with people like him my entire career.
For example, as attorney general of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges that scammed students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: As a pres- -- as a prosecutor, I specialized in cases of sexual abuse. Well, Donald Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: As attorney general, I held Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Well, Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud -- 34 counts. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, all of this -- yeah, the courts will deal with that. We going to win in November. (Laughs.) We going to win in November. (Applause.) We'll handle that too.
So -- but all of this is to say: In this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his every day of the week. (Applause.) Every day of the week.
But make no mistake, that being said, our campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. It is about --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I love you back. (Applause.)
Our campaign -- our campaign is about two different visions for our nation. One, ours, focused on the future. The other, focused on the past. And, Arizona, we -- we fight for the future. (Applause.) A future with affordable health care, affordable child care, and paid leave. (Applause.) A future where we build a broad-based economy where every American has an opportunity to own a home, to start a business, to build wealth. (Applause.)
Here with us today, I know we have a number of Native leaders. And as president, I will tell you -- (applause) -- I will always honor tribal sovereignty and respect tribal self-determination -- (applause) -- and fight for a future where every Native person can realize their aspirations and every Native community is a place of opportunity. (Applause.)
We here -- we believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America's families -- (applause) -- so that they have the chance not just to get by, but to get ahead. (Applause.) Because, look, while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it, and I know it.
When I was attorney general, I went after price-fixing schemes. And when I am president, I will continue that work to bring down prices. I will take on -- (applause) -- I will take on big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging. I will take on corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families. (Applause.) I will take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. (Applause.)
And all of this is to say, unlike Donald Trump, I will always put the middle class and working families first. (Applause.)
Because you see, Coach Walz and I know the middle class built the United States of America. (Applause.) And when the middle class is strong, America is strong. (Applause.)
And while we work to move our nation forward, look, Donald Trump, be very clear, intends to move us backward.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Just look -- and we're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not gong back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we're not going back. We are not going back. We're going back. No.
But just look -- look -- look at his -- you know, Tim talked about it. Look at his Project 2025 agenda.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's 900-plus pages. I can't believe they put that thing in writing, by the way. (Laughter.) But when you look at it, when you read it, you will see Project 2025 is a plan to weaken the middle class. If he is elected, Donald Trump intends to give a tax break to billionaires and big corporations.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to surrender our fight against the climate crisis.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And, Arizona, every day you feel the impact of extreme heat and drought. You know this crisis is real. He calls it a hoax.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on top of all of this, if Donald Trump wins in November, he intends -- he intends to end the Affordable Care Act --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was?
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Remember what that was?
AUDIENCE MEMBER: He won't win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He won't win. You're right. (Applause.) He won't win.
AUDIENCE: He won't win! He won't win! He won't win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We will win. We will win.
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And -- and part of why we are going to win is because we remember and we are smart and we know what's happening and we're not falling for the gaslighting and we're not falling for the okey-doke. (Applause.) That's why.
So, look, America has tried so many of those failed policies before, and, like we all know, we're not going back. (Applause.) We -- we will move forward and take on the biggest issues facing our nation.
For example, the issue of immigration. So, I was attorney general of a border state. I went after the transnational gangs, the drug cartels, and human traffickers. (Applause.) I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won. (Applause.) So I know what I'm talking about.
We know our immigration system is broken, and we know what it takes to fix it: comprehensive reform that includes strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship. (Applause.)
But Donald Trump does not want to fix this problem. Be clear about that. He has no interest or desire to actually fix the problem. He talks a big game about border security, but he does not walk the walk.
Earlier this year -- everybody here knows, earlier this year, we had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan border security bill in decades, but Donald Trump tanked the deal --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- because he thought by doing that it would help him win an election.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But when I am president, I will sign the bill. (Applause.)
So, Arizona, ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom. (Applause.)
Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault against hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights: the freedom to vote; the freedom to be safe from gun violence -- (applause); the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride -- (applause); and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. (Applause.)
And on that last point, understand how we got here. When he was president, Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- with the intention that they would overturn and undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did. And now, in over 20 states in our nation, there is a Trump abortion ban.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Many, like Arizona, with no exceptions even for rape or incest.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And just yesterday in a press conference, we got a fresh reminder of what Donald Trump's Project 2025 agenda would do. It would ban medication abortion in every state.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But we are not going to let that happen --
AUDIENCE: Nooo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- because we trust women. (Applause.)
And when I am president of the United States and when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedoms for every woman In America, I will sign it into law. (Applause.)
So, listen, here's the thing that we all know -- here's the thing we all know: Generations -- generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Now, the baton is in our hands -- (applause) -- each and every one of us. So, we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to vote act. (Applause.)
And we who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban, universal background checks, and red flag laws. (Applause.)
So much is on the line in this election. And understand, this is not 2016 and this is not 2020. You know, this time around, the stakes are even higher. And that's because last month, the United States Supreme Court basically just told the former president, who has been convicted of fraud, that going forward, he was -- he will be effectively immune no matter what he does in the White House.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But -- but think about what that means. Think about what that means in this election. Think about what that means. He's been effectively told he will be immune if he's back in the White House. Think about what that means when you remember Donald Trump has openly vowed, if reelected, he will be a dictator on day one --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- that he will weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Remember that he even called for th,e quote, ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Understand what this means.
And let us be very clear: Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the United States president. (Applause.) Never again. Never again.
So, Arizona, it all comes down to this. We are here because we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. That's right. We love our country. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. That's -- that's how we preserve the promise of America.
And after all, the promise of America is what makes it possible for Governor Walz and me to be on the same stage together.
Because think: two middle class kids. One, a daughter of Oakland, California -- (applause) -- who was raised by a working mother, had a summer job at McDonald's. (Applause.) The other, a son of Nebraska plains, who grew up working on a farm. Think about it. Only in America is it possible for them together to make it all the way to the White House. (Applause.) Only in America. Only in America.
So, we, together, all of us -- we're running this campaign on behalf of all Americans, from red states to blue states, from the heartland to the coast. And when we are elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans. (Applause.) All Americans.
So, Arizona, ultimately, in this election, I do believe we each -- each one of us, we face a question. That question being: What kind of country do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a country of chaos, fear, and hate --
AUDIENCE: Nooo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- or a country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law? (Applause.)
And the beauty -- the beauty of our democracy -- the beauty of our democracy is that we each have the power to answer that question. Each one of us in a democracy has the power to answer that question. The power is with the people. (Applause.)
And in the next, then, 88 days, we need you to use your power. (Applause.) We need you to knock on some doors. (Applause.) We need you to register folks to vote. (Applause.) We need you to energize, to mobilize, to organize, and to make your voices heard. (Applause.)
So, Arizona, I ask, are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight --
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win. (Applause.)
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. God bless you. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President with Governor Tim Walz at a Campaign Event in Las Vegas, Nevada
  


  

  
    August 10, 2024  

  
    GOVERNOR WALZ: Wow. Wow, wow, wow. Hey -- (applause) --
AUDIENCE: Gov! Gov! Gov!
GOVERNOR WALZ: (Laughs.) (Applause.) Wow. Wow.
One more time for Tilly. Thank you. (Applause.)
Well, hello, Las Vegas. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Now, I know some of you spent the week googling Minnesota a little bit -- (laughter) -- and to figure out who these Minnesotans were.
Here's the one thing I can tell you about us. We spend about half our lives talking about the weather. (Laughter.) It's what we do. So, I want to say thank you to all of the people since I've been here to remind me that it's a dry heat outside. (Laughter.) So -- so is your damn oven, but, you know, that's -- (laughter) -- I'm melting like a snowman outside.
But, look, this is incredible. And I want to say a thank you to a few folks I had the privilege of working with when I served in Congress. You have two of the best senators you could ever hope for -- (applause): Senator Cortez Masto and Senator Rosen.
Just as a side note, there's lots of commonalities here -- it may not be the weather; we walk on water half the year it's so damn cold, but that's what we are. But we have something in common. Both Minnesota and Nevada have two women senators, and that's a pretty good thing. (Applause.)
Huge thank you to Congressman Horsford -- (applause); Congresswoman Lee -- (applause); and -- and a longtime friend I served with, Congresswoman Titus. Grateful. (Applause.)
A special thank you is for what I'm looking at right here: to every one of you. You took time out of your busy lives. You didn't need to be here. There's many things you could have been doing. You chose. You braved 108-degree heat -- I can't even believe I'm saying that -- (laughter) -- just to be here.
And I have to tell you, I understand, because of the heat, they had to shut the door early and turn thousands of folks away.
AUDIENCE: Aww --
GOVERNOR WALZ: But don't worry, we're going to be back a lot. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
All the things -- you got babysitters; you had to do everything -- but you came here for something bigger than yourselves for one simple, eloquent, and beautiful reason: You love this country. (Applause.) Thank you.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
GOVERNOR WALZ: USA!
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
GOVERNOR WALZ: I'm so incredibly proud to be on this ticket -- and I want to give a big shout-out -- with the support of a special group tonight, Culinary Workers Union 226. (Applause.)
We're here for that love, and the end of this road -- remember, 87 days. Rarely in your life do you get an opportunity in 87 days to change the trajectory of not just today or tomorrow but for generations around the world. (Applause.)
And I keep saying this: We can do anything for 87 days. And my mantra is, ""We'll sleep when we're dead."" We'll sleep when we're dead. (Applause.) Because when you wake up on that 88th day, you're going to get to say, ""Welcome, Madam President Harris."" (Applause.)
This is -- this is a leader that wakes up every day to try and do things for the American people. She will -- she took on the predators, the fraudsters, the transnational gangs; stood up against the greed of corporate interests -- (applause); stood with working people in organized labor -- (applause); and never failed to reach across the aisle if it meant improving people's lives. (Applause.)
I was taught a little something about that commitment too. I was born in a small town in Nebraska where community was a way of life. (Applause.) There's some Nebraskans in the house. Yay, Cornhuskers.
You think I'm kidding. You think I'm kidding. Four hundred people, 25 kids in my class, 12 were cousins. That's small town. (Laughter.) That's small town.
But you know what? My parents and my community taught me generosity towards my neighbor and to work for the common good. (Applause.)
My -- my dad was a chain-smoking, Korean War-era veteran, who two days after my 17th birthday took me down to sign up to join the National Guard. (Applause.) I was proud, for the next 24 years, to wear the uniform of this country. (Applause.)
Thank -- thank you to every single one of you who wore that uniform. And I have to tell you, like my dad before me and millions of others, the G.I. Bill gave me a shot at a college education. (Applause.)
And just -- and just like Tilly, my dad was a teacher, my older brother was a teacher, my sister was a teacher, my younger brother was a teacher. (Applause.) And we married teachers, so -- (laughter). The privilege of my lifetime was spending two decades teaching in public schools t- -- (applause) -- and -- and, you might have heard, coaching football to a state championship, so -- (applause). Here's --
AUDIENCE: Coach! Coach! Coach!
GOVERNOR WALZ: Don't ever close that yearbook. That's my pro tip. (Laughter.)
Look, my students and my players are the ones who encouraged me to run for office. They saw in me what I hoped to instill in them: a commitment to a common good and something so important -- the belief, as each and every one of you came here as a single person, a single person can make a difference. (Applause.) Can make a difference.
Never planned in my life to run for office, but I think my life prepared me well. And when my neighbors and -- asked if I'd run for office, I was pretty clueless. I did not know that the district I was running in had only had one Democrat since 1892 before me. (Laughter.) But my community graced me with the opportunity to represent them in the United States Congress for 12 years -- (applause) -- where I had the privilege of serving as the ranking member on the VA committee, working with Republicans to most -- pass the most extensive veterans package since the G.I. Bill. (Applause.)
I learned -- I learned the art of compromising without compromising my values. (Applause.)
And as -- now, as governor, I bring all those experience together to tackle the most pressing challenges we have in the great state of Minnesota. (Applause.)
Now each of you came here -- you came here because you love the country. You came here because you know a fantastic leader is going to walk out those doors in a minute or two, the person that you see bringing everything to us.
But just be very clear here: Donald Trump sees the world very differently than all of us here.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: Each of you talk about service. Donald Trump knows nothing about service. (Applause.) It's --
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
GOVERNOR WALZ: Yay.
It's pretty hard to provide service to others when you're too busy looking out for only yourself. (Applause.)
Again and again and again Donald Trump made decisions to weaken this country to strengthen his own hand. He mocked our laws, he sowed division and chaos amongst our citizens, and that's to say nothing of his record as president.
He froze in the face of the global COVID pandemic, and our neigh- -- and our neighbors died because of it. By not addressing COVID -- by not addressing COVID, he drove our economy into the ground. (Applause.)
And I just want to set the record straight, because facts do matter, and there's not an alternate set of facts. (Applause.) Here's one for you: Violent crime was up during the Trump presidency, and that's even not counting his crimes. (Laughter.)
Some of you -- some of you gray-hair or no-hairs in here can actually remember a time when Republicans actually talked about freedom and believed in it. Not these guys. These are the guys that believe government should be free to invade your exam room with your doctor.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: I'm sure it's true here in Nevada, as it's true in Minnesota: We respect our neighbors' rights to make their own personal choices. (Applause.)
We don't have to agree with them or make the same choice, but we know that this nation -- things work best when you mind your own damn business. When you mind your own damn business. (Applause.)
I don't -- I don't need any help -- I don't need any help from those guys telling me which books to read. (Applause.)
I sure the heck don't need any lecture about morality from those guys. (Applause.)
And the last thing they can mind their own damn business is I don't need any help from them talking about my family. (Applause.)
And this is where it gets personal, where they want to dictate things like IVF and reproductive care.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: I know there's a lot of you out there -- this is the most personal choices we have. When my wife and I decided to have children, we spent years going through fertility treatments, and I said, I remember --
We have somebody to help? We have water?
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We need a medic.
GOVERNOR WALZ: All right. Thanks for helping your neighbors. But I -- (applause) --
You're going to help them? You're good? All right. Thank you.
I remember those -- waiting for the phone calls. You'd go through the treatments. I would have my neighbor come over to have to give shots to my wife and things like that. And the phone would ring, and you would just hope so highly that it would be good news. And then when you found out the treatments didn't work, it was a darkness that could blot out the sun.
So, I have to tell you, it wasn't by chance when that phone call finally came and we found out we were going to welcome our daughter into the world -- (applause) -- we -- we named her the most powerful word in the universe: Hope. Hope. (Applause.)
So, when you hear -- when you hear Kamala Harris and I talk about freedom -- we're very clear about this -- we mean the freedom to make your own health care decisions -- (applause) -- and that your children should be free to go to school without worrying about being shot dead in their classroom. (Applause.)
Look, again, I know Nevada is a lot like Minnesota. In Minnesota, we believe in the Second Amendment, but we also believe in commonsense gun violence laws. (Applause.)
Vice President Harris believes education be a -- should be a ticket to the middle class, not crippling student loan debt. (Applause.)
And we come here today because in 87 days, we're going to settle our political differences not through violence; we're going to settle it by beating them at the ballot box. (Applause.)
So, look, I keep saying this. This is a pretty -- a pretty simple thing here. This election is about the choice about what direction this country will go in. And I want to be clear, I know very clearly that I am preaching to the choir, but here's my words for you: The choir needs to sing. The choir needs to
sing. (Applause.)
So, the other day I was saying this -- I started out by saying, ""Don't believe Donald Trump when he plays dumb about 2025,"" but then I remembered, you don't believe him on anything, because that's what you shouldn't believe. (Applause.)
But, look, I coached football for enough years -- when somebody draws up a playbook, they plan on using it -- (applause) -- and when they do, they'll restrict our freedoms. When they do, they'll do what they've done: They'll rig the economy so that the middle class gets nothing and the rich get richer.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: If this guy gets an opportunity again, he won't only pick up where he left off, it will be much worse than it was last time. He'll gut Social Security, pull your health care, underfund public schools -- all of it.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back!
GOVERNOR WALZ: That's damn right.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back!
GOVERNOR WALZ: Damn right. We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
GOVERNOR WALZ: Look, this guy is not fighting for you or your family. He doesn't give a damn. And his running mate shares his dangerous and backward agenda.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
GOVERNOR WALZ: I said this: All of my friends, we went to Yale, had billionaires fund our career, and then we write a book trashing our neighbors that raised us.
Come on. We're better than that. We're better than that.
And I said it -- I want to be clear: I didn't call anybody names. I spent enough years in that lunchroom to know bullies when I see them. I just made a very clear observation that they seem to be really concerned about. I pointed out that taking away reproductive freedoms, banning books, raising the price of inlin -- insulin, trying to hurt labor unions -- nobody is asking for that weird crap. No one is asking for it. (Applause.)
Here is the good news. We do the work -- this is about the future. We do the work, none of that's going to happen. Vice President Harris believes in those freedoms. She knows that every single person should get a chance at the middle class. She believes in something so beautiful: the promise of America. It's that simple: the promise of America. (Applause.)
Madam Vice President, I want to say thank you for putting the trust in me to be your running mate. (Applause.) And I want to say, she has done so much. And with you together, it's reminded us about something. It's reminded us that this work can be about goodness. It can be about smiling. It's tough work, but we can be happy doing it. (Applause.)
And -- and Kamala Harris has done something that we for forever be grateful for her: She has brought out the joy in our politics. (Applause.)
Nevada, join me in welcoming the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris. (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hey, Nevada! (Applause.) Can we hear it for Tim Walz? (Applause.)
Oh, it's so good to be back. Good evening, everyone. (Applause.) Good evening. Good evening. (Applause.)
Oh, I see lots of friends. Oh, it is good to be back. It is good to be back. (Applause.) Thank you all. My goodness. (Applause.)
S- -- but, seriously, isn't Tim Walz fantastic? (Applause.)
And I know, for some folks, you're just getting to know him and you've heard he's had many titles over his life: governor, congressman, dad, husband, coach. (Laughs.) (Applause.) But in 87 days, our nation is going to know Coach Walz as vice president of the United States of America. (Applause.) That's right.
And it is so good to be here with so many incredible leaders, including my dear friends Senator Catherine Cortez Masto -- (applause); Senator Jacky Rosen -- (applause) -- who we will reelect to the United States Senate -- (applause); Congressmembers Dina Titus -- (applause), Steven Horsford -- (applause), and Susie Lee. (Applause.)
And I know Culinary 226 is in the house. (Applause.) (Inaudible) --
AUDIENCE: 226! 226! 226!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right.
AUDIENCE: 226! 226!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And the culinary union, as everyone in Nevada knows, they have helped lead the way in our country for workers' rights and workers' dignity. (Applause.)
And I have to say, for years, I've been so proud to work by your side. When I was attorney general of California, we worked together to crack down on wage theft. (Applause.) When I was a United States senator, we fought together for paid family leave and medical leave. (Applause.) And earlier this year, right here in Vegas, we celebrated your historic contract win. (Applause.)
And it is my promise to everyone here, when I am president, we will continue our fight for working families of America -- (applause) -- including to raise the minimum wage -- (applause) -- and eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers. (Applause.)
And, Nevada, today, I also bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden. (Applause.) Joe.
AUDIENCE: Joe! Joe! Joe!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We love Joe.
AUDIENCE: We love Joe! We love Joe! We love Joe!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's great. That's great.
And I know -- I'm going to tell him what you all just said. (Laughter.)
And I know we are all so deeply grateful to Joe Biden for his lifetime of service to our nation -- (applause) -- and he's not done. And he's not done.
So, as I said, it's so good to be back in Las Vegas. The last time I was here, I stopped by the practice for the Men's National Basketball Team before they headed out to the Olympics. (Applause.)
And maybe you saw it on your phone, but just a few hours ago in Paris, they won the gold. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I got more for you. A few hours before that, our Women's National Soccer Team won the gold as well. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: USA. USA. That's right.
So, in one sport after another, Team USA continues to make our nation proud. (Applause.) So much to celebrate. So much to celebrate.
So, Nevada, we have 87 days until the election -- 87 days. And here's the thing --
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: We got your back! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But here's the thing. Here's the thing. We know this will be a tight race until the very end, and so let's not pay too much attention to the polls, because we have some hard work ahead of us. But we like hard work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work. (Applause.) And with your help this November, we will win. (Applause.) We will win. We will win. We will win.
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I know we are all clear -- toward that win, we are all clear about what we are up against.
As many of you know, before I was elected vice president, before I was elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and, before that, district attorney. (Applause.) And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. (Applause.)
In those roles -- in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds -- (applause): predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, scammers who broke the rules for personal gain. So, Nevada, hear me when I say I know Donald Trump's type. (Applause.) (Laughs.) I do. I do.
AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Whoa, whoa, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. The courts are going to take care of that. We just going to beat them in November. We'll beat them in November. (Applause.) We'll beat them in November.
But I've certainly been dealing with people like him my entire career.
For example, as attorney general of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges that scammed students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Remember that.
As a prosecutor, I specialized in cases of sexual abuse. Well, Donald Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: As attorney general, I held Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Well -- (applause) -- Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud -- 34 counts. (Applause.)
All of this is to say, in this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his every day of the week -- every day of
the week. (Applause.)
That being said, let's make no mistake: This campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. It is about two different visions for our nation: one, ours, focused on the future; the other focused on the past.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But we're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We are not going back.
And we're not going back because, Nevada, we fight for the future -- (applause) -- a future with affordable health care, affordable childcare, and paid leave. (Applause.)
We fight for a future where we build a broad-based economy, where every American has an opportunity to own a home, to start a business, and to build wealth. (Applause.)
We believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America's families so they have a chance not just to get by but to get ahead -- to get ahead. (Applause.)
Because, look, while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it.
When I was attorney general, I went after price-fixing schemes, and when I am president, I will continue that work to bring down prices. (Applause.) I will take on big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging, corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families, and -- (applause) -- and take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. (Applause.)
Unlike Donald Trump, I will always -- I promise you -- put the middle class and working families first. (Applause.)
Because, you see, Tim Walz and I may not appear to have a whole lot in common, but we have so much in common. And I'll tell you what he and I know: The middle class built the United States of America -- (applause) -- and when the middle class is strong, America is strong. (Applause.)
And so, while we together work to move our nation forward, Donald Trump has a different plan. Just look at his Project 2025 agenda.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Which I keep saying, I can't believe they put that in writing. (Laughter.) So, if he is elected, Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he intends to surrender our fight against the climate crisis.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I don't need to tell Nevada every day, because you feel the impact of extreme heat and drought. (Applause.) You know the climate crisis is real. But Donald Trump, well, he claims it's a hoax.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on top of this, if Donald Trump were to win in November -- he won't -- (applause) -- but if he were to win in November, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Think about that. To take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You remember what that was like? Children with asthma. Breast cancer survivors. Grandparents with diabetes.
Look, America has tried these failed policies before, and we are not --
AUDIENCE: Going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- going back. (Applause.) We are not going back. We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: No. And we are going to move forward. We will move forward. (Applause.)
And in moving forward, we will take on the biggest issues facing our nation. For example, we will address the issue of immigration. (Applause.)
I was the attorney of a border state -- attorney general of a border state. I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers who came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won. (Applause.)
We know our immigration system is broken, and we know what it takes to fix it: comprehensive reform that includes, yes, strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship. (Applause.)
But Donald Trump doesn't want to fix this problem. He talks a big game about a lot of things. (Laughter.) But he talks a big game about border security, but he does not walk the walk.
Earlier this year, we had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan border security bill in decades, but Donald Trump tanked the bill because he thought it would help him win an election.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, when I am president, I will sign that bill into law. (Applause.)
Nevada, ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom. (Applause.)
Across our nation, we have been witnessing a full-on assault on hard-won, hard-fought freedoms and fundamental rights: the -- the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride -- (applause) -- and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.) A fight for freedom.
And on that last point, we all know how we got here. When he was president, Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- because he intended for them to undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did.
Now in more than 20 states, there is a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And be sure, if he were to win, he would sign a national abortion ban, which would outlaw abortion in every state, even Nevada.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But we are not going to let that happen -- (applause) -- because we trust women. (Applause.)
And when I am president of the United States and Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedoms, I will sign it into law. (Applause.)
So, I know the folks who are here. I know the people of Nevada; you are Battle Born. (Applause.) You are Battle Born. And if Donald Trump wants to pick a fight over our most fundamental freedoms, we say: Bring it on. Bring it on. (Applause.) Bring it on.
AUDIENCE: Bring it on! Bring it on! Bring it on!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Because we're ready. We're ready.
So, Nevada, generations -- generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Now the baton is in our hands. (Applause.) Each and every one of us.
So, we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. (Applause.)
And we who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban, universal
background checks, and red flag laws. (Applause.)
So much is on the line. So much is on the line in this election. And understand this is not 2016. This is not 2020. This time around, the stakes are even higher, and that's because last month, the Supreme Court of the United States basically told --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- the former president that going forward, he will effectively be immune no matter what he does in the White House.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But -- but think about what that means. Think about what that means.
So, Donald Trump has vowed to be a dictator on day one if reelected.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He said he will weaponize, essentially, the Department of Justice against his political enemies.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And even called for the, quote, ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Let us be very clear: Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of president of the United States. (Applause.) Never again.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. That's right. That's right.
We know what we stand for as Americans. And, you know, it all comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. (Applause.)
That is how we preserve the promise of America. And think about it, after all, the promise of America is what makes it possible for Tim Walz and me to be together on this stage today. (Applause.) Think about that. Think about that. Think about it.
Two middle-class kids. One a daughter of Oakland, California -- (applause) -- who was raised by a working mother. I had a summer job at McDonald's. (Applause.) The other, a son of the Nebraska plains, who grew up working on a farm. (Applause.) Think about it. Think about it. Only in America is it possible that the two of them would be running together all the way to the White House. (Applause.) Only in America.
Only in America.
So, look --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I love you back. (Applause.) I love you back.
So, look, we are -- together, we are running this campaign on behalf of all Americans -- (applause) -- from red states to blue states, from the heartland to the coast. And when elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans. (Applause.) All Americans.
So, Nevada, ultimately, in this election, I believe we each face a question: What kind of country do we want to live in? A country of chaos, fear, and hate?
AUDIENCE: Noo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Or a country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law? (Applause.)
And the beauty -- and the beauty of our democracy -- here's the thing. The beauty of our democracy is we each -- each person has the power -- each person has the power to answer that question. (Applause.) The power is with the people. The power is with the people. (Applause.) It's with the people.
And so, in the next 87 days, we need you to use your power -- (laughs) -- (applause) -- to knock on doors, register folks to vote, and make your voices heard. (Applause.)
So, Nevada, today, I ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight --
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win!
God bless you. God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Raleigh, North Carolina
  


  

  
    August 16, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Can we hear it for Mike D? (Applause.)
Hello, family and friends. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Oh, it's good to be back in North Carolina. Oh, it's good to see everyone. (Applause.) Thank you.
Oh, it's good to see everyone. Good afternoon. Everyone, please have a seat, if you have a seat. (Laughter.) Please have a seat.
Mike D, I have to -- so, Mike D's Barbecue -- let me tell you one of the biggest fans of Mike D's barbecue: my husband, Doug Emhoff. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
And -- and thank you, Mike, for sharing your story. And -- and I'm just so sorry for what your family has been through, but you have, out of an incredible tragedy, done so much for the community, and you are such a role model. So, thank you, Mike, for everything you do. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you.
And good afternoon to everyone here. Thank you to all of the incredible leaders with us today, including my friend, the governor, Roy Cooper. Where is he? (Applause.) Here with his daughter.
Every time I land in North Carolina, I -- just literally coming down the stairs of Air Force Two, I will shout to Roy Cooper, ""What number is it, Roy?"" (Laughter.) And today, he shouted, ""16,"" which is the number of times I've been in this beautiful state since I've been vice president. (Applause.) Every time.
I want to thank your next governor, Attorney General Josh Stein. (Applause.) He's doing incredible work. He's going to be an extraordinary governor.
Representatives Adam[s], Manning, Foushee, and Nickel, thank you all for your support, for your friendship, for your leadership. (Applause.)
Chair Thomas of the Wake County Board of Commissioners, thank you for all that you do. (Applause.)
And to all the leaders that are here today, including the students and instructors here at Wake Tech North, thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)
So, thank you all.
So, listen, this election, I do strongly believe, is about two very different visions for our nation: one, ours, focused on the future; and the other, focused on the past.
We see that contrast clearly in many ways, including when it comes to how we think about the economy.
So, our country has come a long way since President Biden and I took office. At that time, we sadly remember the millions of Americans that were out of work. We were facing one of the worst economic crises in modern history.
And, today, by virtually every measure, our economy is the strongest in the world. (Applause.)
We have created 16 million new jobs. We have made historic investments in infrastructure, in chips manufacturing, in clean energy. And new numbers this week alone show that inflation is down under 3 percent. (Applause.)
And as president of the United States, it will be my intention to build on the foundation of this progress.
Still, we know that many Americans don't yet feel that progress in their daily lives. Costs are still too high. And on a deeper level, for too many people, no matter how much they work, it feels so hard to just be able to get ahead.
As president, I will be laser-focused on creating opportunities for the middle class that advance their economic security, stability, and dignity.
Together, we will build what I call an ""opportunity economy"" -- (applause) -- ""an opportunity economy"" -- an economy where everyone can compete and have a real chance to succeed; everyone, regardless of who they are or where they start, has an opportunity to build wealth for themselves and their children; and where we remove the barriers to opportunity so anyone who wants to start a business or advance their career can access the tools and the resources that are necessary to do so. (Applause.)
I will focus on cutting needless bureaucracy and unnecessary regulatory red tape and encouraging -- (applause) -- and encouraging innovative technologies while protecting consumers and creating a stable business environment with consistent and transparent rules of the road.
As president, I will bring together labor with small businesses and major companies to invest in America, to create good jobs, achieve broad-based growth, and ensure that America continues to define the future and lead the world. (Applause.)
And key -- key to creating this opportunity economy is building up our middle class. It is essential. (Applause.)
The middle class is one of America's greatest strengths, and to protect it, then, we must defend basic principles -- such as, your salary should be enough to provide you and your family with a good quality of life. (Applause.)
Such as, no child should have to grow up in poverty. (Applause.)
Such as, after years of hard work, you should be able to retire with dignity. (Applause.)
And you should be able to join a union if you choose.
Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency, because I strongly believe when the middle class is strong, America is strong. (Applause.)
So, in the weeks to come, I will address in greater detail my plans to build an opportunity economy. And, today, I will focus on one element that's on the minds of many Americans as they pay their bills at the kitchen table or walk the aisles of a grocery store, and that is lowering the cost of living. (Applause.)
So, every day across our nation, families talk about their plans for the future; their ambitions; their aspirations for themselves, for their children; and they talk about how they're going to be able to actually achieve them financially. Because, look, the bills add up -- food, rent, gas, back-to-school clothes, prescription medication. After all that, for many families, there's mo- -- not much left at the end of the month.
I grew up in a middle-class household. For most of my childhood, we were renters. My mother saved for well over a decade to buy a home. I was a teenager when that day finally came, and I can remember so well how excited she was. I kind of understood what it meant, but -- we called her ""Mommy"" -- Mommy was so excited, it just made us excited that she was so excited. (Laughter.)
Later in college, I worked at McDonald's to earn spending money. Well, some of the people I worked with were raising families on that paycheck. They worked second or even third jobs to pay rent and buy food. That only gets harder when the cost of living goes up.
When I am elected president, I will make it a top priority to bring down costs and increase economic security for all Americans. As president, I will take on the high costs that matter most to most Americans, like the cost of food.
We all know that prices went up during the pandemic when the supply chains shut down and failed, but our supply chains have now improved and prices are still too high.
A lo- -- a loaf of bread costs 50 percent more today than it did before the pandemic. Ground beef is up almost 50 percent. Many of the big food companies are seeing their highest profits in two decades. And while many grocery chains pass along these savings, others still aren't.
Look, I know most businesses are creating jobs, contributing to our economy, and playing by the rules, but some are not, and that's just not right, and we need to take action when that is the case. A- -- (applause) --
As attorney general in California, I went after companies that illegally increased prices, including wholesalers that inflated the price of prescription medication and companies that conspired with competitors to keep prices of electronics high. I won more than $1 billion for consumers. (Applause.)
So, believe me, as president, I will go after the bad actors. (Applause.) And I will work to pass the first-ever federal ban on prou- -- price gauging [gouging] on food. (Applause.)
My plan will include new penalties for opportunistic companies that exploit crises and break the rules, and we will support smaller food businesses that are trying to play by the rules and get ahead. (Applause.)
We will help the food industry become more competitive, because I believe competition is the lifeblood of our economy. More competition means lower prices for you and your families. (Applause.)
Now compare what Donald Trump plans to do. He wants to impose what is, in effect, a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities that we import from other countries.
That will devastate Americans. It will mean higher prices on just about every one of your daily needs: a Trump tax on gas, a Trump tax on food, a Trump tax on clothing, a Trump tax on over-the-counter medication.
And, you know, economists have done the math. Donald Trump's plan would cost a typical family $3,900 a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: At this moment when everyday prices are too high, he will make them even higher.
As president, I'll attack and take on the issue of the cost of health care. As attorney general, I took on insurance companies and Big Pharma and got them to lower their prices. (Applause.)
And together with President Biden, we've gone even further. We capped the price of insulin at $35 a month and the total cost -- (applause) -- and the total cost of prescription drugs at $2,000 a year for seniors.
We let Medicare negotiate lower drug prices for seniors.
And just yesterday -- and just yesterday, we announced that we are lowering the price by up to 80 percent for 10 more lifesaving drugs. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I pledge to continue this progress. I'll lower the cost of insulin and prescription drugs for everyone with your support, not only our seniors -- (applause) -- and demand transparency from the middlemen who operate between Big Pharma and the insurance companies, who use opaque practices to raise your drug prices and profit off your need for medicine.
Two months ago, I announced that medical debt will no longer be used against your credit score. (Applause.) And I will work, as president, with states like here in North Carolina -- Roy Cooper, thank you again -- to cancel medical debt for more and more -- millions more Americans. (Applause.)
As for Donald Trump, well, he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- which 45 million Americans rely on. Forty-five million Americans rely on it for health care.
That would take us back to a time when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. We all remember what that was --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and we're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And -- and remember -- and this is why we're not going back, because we do remember -- (laughter) -- he tried to cut Medicare every year he was president, threatening a program that tens of millions of seniors count on.
And according to his Project 2025 agenda, he intends to undo our work to bring down prescription drugs -- the cost of prescription drugs and insulin costs.
Well, we've come too far to let that happen. (Applause.)
So, we're not going back on that, and let's talk about the cost of housing. (Applause.)
So, now, the housing market can be complicated, but, look, I'm not new to this issue. As state attorney general, I drafted and helped pass a homeowner bill of rights, one of the first in America.
And during the foreclosure crisis, I took on the big banks for predatory lending with many of my colleagues, including Roy Cooper, and won $20 billion for California families when I was attorney general. (Applause.)
So, I know how to fight for people who are being exploited in the housing market, and I know what homeownership means. It's more than a financial transaction. It's so much more than that. It's more than a house.
Homeownership and what that means -- it's a symbol of the pride that comes with hard work. It's financial security. It represents what you will be able to do for your children. (Applause.)
And sadly, right now, it is out of reach for far too many American families. There's a serious housing shortage in many places. It's too difficult to build, and it's driving prices up.
As president, I will work in partnership with industry to build the housing we need, both to rent and to buy. We will take down barriers and cut red tape, including at the state and local levels. (Applause.)
And by the end of my first term, we will end America's housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class, and we will do that together. We will do that together. (Applause.)
And -- and we will make sure those homes actually go to working- and middle-class Americans -- (applause) -- not just investors. Because, you know, some corporate landlords -- some of them buy dozens, if not hundreds, of houses and apartments. Then they turn them around and rent them out at extremely high prices, and it can make it impossible, then, for regular people to be able to buy or even rent a home.
Some corporate landlords collude with each other to set artificially high rental prices, often using algorithms and price-fixing software to do it. It's anticompetitive, and it drives up costs. I will fight for a law that cracks down on these practices. (Applause.)
We also know that as the price of housing has gone up, the size of down payments have gone up as well. Even if aspiring homeowners save for years, it often still is not enough.
So, in addition, while we work on the housing shortage, my administration will provide first-time homebuyers with $25,000
to help with the down payment on a new home. (Applause.)
We can do this. We can do this, all to help more Americans experience the pride of homeownership and the financial security that it represents and brings.
So, that's my plan. But here's what Donald Trump would do.
If his Project 2025 agenda is put into effect, it will add around $1,200 a year to the typical American mortgage.
He's got it backward. We should be doing everything we can to make it more affordable to buy a home, not less. (Applause.)
Finally, there's one more way I will help families deal with rising costs, and that's by letting you keep more of your hard-earned money. (Applause.) Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut, and we will do this by restoring two tax cuts designed to help middle-class and working Americans: the Earned Income Tax Credit -- (applause) -- and the Child Tax Credit -- (applause) -- through which millions of Americans with children got to keep more of their hard-earned income.
We know this works and has a direct impact on so many issues, including child poverty. We know it works.
So, as president, I'll not only restore that tax cut but expand it. We will provide $6,000 in tax relief to families during the first year of a child's life.
Now, think what that means. (Applause.) Think what that means. That is a vital -- vital year of critical development of a child, and the costs can really add up, especially for young parents who need to buy diapers and clothes and a car seat and so much else. And we will do this while reducing the deficit.
Compare my plan with what Donald Trump intends to do. He plans to give billionaires massive tax cuts year after year and he plans to cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars, even as they pull in record profits. And that's on top of the $2 trillion tax cut he already signed into law when he was president, which, by the way, overwhelming- -- overwhelmingly went to the wealthiest Americans and corporations and exploded the national deficit.
You know, I think that if you want to know who someone cares about, look who they fight for -- look who they fight for. (Applause.)
Donald Trump fights for billionaires and large corporations. We -- I will fight to give money back to working- and middle-class Americans. (Applause.)
So, I'll end with this. Two days ago, Donald Trump was here in North Carolina.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He said he was going to talk about the economy -- (laughter) -- I think you all watched; you know what I'm about to say -- but he offered no serious plans to reduce costs for middle-class families, no plan to expand access to housing or health care. And that, actually, I think, for most of us, was not surprising because we already know his plans. We know the Project 2025 agenda.
So, there's a choice in this election: Donald Trump's plans to devastate the middle class, punish working people, and make the cost of living go up for millions of Americans; and, on the other hand, when I'm elected president, what we'll do -- (applause) -- what we will do to bring down costs,
increase the security and stability financially of your family, and expand opportunity for working- and middle-class Americans. (Applause.)
So, now -- now -- now is the time to chart a new way forward. (Applause.) Now is the time to chart a new way forward, to build --
AUDIENCE: A new way forward! A new way forward! A new way forward!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: A new way forward, yes. A new way forward.
AUDIENCE: A new way forward! A new way forward! A new way forward!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: To build -- to build an America where everyone's work is rewarded and talents are valued, where we work with labor and business to strengthen the American economy, and where everyone has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead.
So, I thank you, North Carolina. We're going to get this done -- (applause) -- and with your help. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. God bless you. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President Harris and Governor Tim Walz After Greeting the Aliquippa High School Football Team in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania
  


  

  
    August 18, 2024  

  
    GOVERNOR WALZ: First of all, Coach, thank you. To each of you, thanks. I know we're interrupting your practice. The busy part and the important part is out there on the field, but thank you for having us on this.
MR. PATRICK: Appreciate it. Thank you for coming.
GOVERNOR WALZ: This is a -- this is pretty sacred ground. Folks in Minnesota know about this place. We know about this team. We know the people you produce -- not just FN- -- NFL players but -- but men of a character that come out of this program, because, as Doug said -- I'm privileged to be on this team -- I'm the current governor of Minnesota, but for 20 years, this was the time of year I looked forward to most. I was a defensive coordinator at Mankato West High School and coached football and -- and taught school.
Public schools are the foundation of our country. And I don't have to tell you, anybody who tells you that it's just a game -- this is more than just a game. This is about building character. It's about doing something bigger than yourself. It's about trusting the person that's standing on each side of you, and, on Friday night, you know they'll be there. And if you look around here, the moments that you're living right now, these guys will be around your whole life. You'll remember them. You'll remember these plays.
I can still remember every single call during that state -- first state championship, how it went. It's that important. I've told people, and they think I'm joking about it, it was harder to win that state football championship than it was to become governor, so -- (laughter) -- it's tough work. You got to count on a lot of things. You got to do a lot of things.
And on our team, we ran a 4-4 defense. (Addressing Jerome Bettis.) I wouldn't have wanted to go against this guy, I can tell you that, but -- (laughter). There's no stopping that run.
But the kids played hard and -- and they understood that it was something bigger than themselves. And I'll have to tell you, being out here with -- with Vice President Harris, I know it'd be easy -- especially now, our politics has been pretty ugly. Our politics has seemed pretty negative. Our politics is something that I know what I fear most is, is that young people turn away from it rather than turning into it.
Politics isn't that much different than this. It's about something bigger than themselves. It's about setting a future goal and trying to reach it. It's about doing it with dignity and hard work. It's about doing it with humility. And when you lose, you walk across the field and you shake hands with the other team and know they played hard too. But we're all in it together to try and make it better.
And things like investing in this public school and having -- I can't imagine what this place looks like when it's filled with folks and the lights are on and the leaves are turning and that game is in the fourth quarter and somebody has to make that play, somebody has to step up, and you look to each side of you and you know, ""I trust them. I trust them to make that play.""
Our country's not that different. Our neighbors want to be with you. Our neighbors want to do what's right. And the more we figure out that we're in this thing together and we have more in common than we have separated, we're going to do a heck of a lot better.
So, I have to tell you, thanks for taking some time. Thanks for giving us the privilege to stand on this field, because you earned the right to be on this field. You earn it with a lot of sweat. You earn it with a lot of time in the weight room. You earn it with the folks who came before you and know that they care how you conduct yourselves on this, and we feel the same way.
We have a responsibility to the American public to conduct ourselves with dignity, conduct ourselves with a vision, and to conduct ourselves and all of this -- when football's done right, it is just fun as heck to play the game. And that's the way things can be.
So, I have to tell you, I am just honored to be with this leader. I'm honored with someone who's showing us that. I'm honored with someone who's out doing politics with a smile on her face and with a sense of that everybody matters.
And we're here in this space to say -- it's not just a cliché -- our future is with you, and we have a responsibility to deliver it to you in good shape, to make sure that we're doing the right things to give you a good shot at the future.
And so, for me, it's a privilege to be on this team. It's a privilege to see this leader do it with such joy. And it's a privilege for me to get to introduce to you -- and this is, like, some of the first times I'm getting to do this -- the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris. (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, I've been reading about you all and hearing about you and your excellence and how you work as a team.
And we've got 79 days to go until the election, but we wanted to stop by and I wanted to stop by so I could tell you all in person, looking at each of you in your eyes, that our nation is counting on you and your excellence. We applaud your ambition. You want to compete. You want to win. And I will tell you that we, as a country, deserve to give you every opportunity that you have to achieve your excellence that you were born with, that is God-given, and that is going to be laying the path to the future of our nation.
You all are the future of our country. And you all have known from the day you were born, we're all born leaders, and it's just a matter of when people decide to turn that on.
The fact that you're on this field today tells me you decided to turn it on at an early stage of your life -- to be a leader and to be a role model.
And, you know, it's not easy being a role model. Welcome to the role model club -- (laughter) -- right?
Being a role model, Pete, means that members of your family, people you know in the neighborhood, others, your classmates, they watch you to see what you do. What goes into that kind of excellence? What goes into being a winning team?
And you all have taken it upon yourselves to take on that responsibility of being role models and to inspire people you may not even know are watching you to see how you can achieve success. And by doing that and all that that requires -- which is the hard work; the practice; working as a team; knowing that you will be undefeated, even if you don't win every game, but no circumstance or event or moment will defeat your spirit and your fight and your preparedness to win and excel, that nothing will dampen your spirit of excellence -- that's what I'm counting on from each of you and that's what makes our nation strong.
So, you keep doing what you're doing and know that there are so many people you may not see at any one moment who are cheering you on. When they're in the stands, when you're in your classroom, when you are living your life on a daily basis, know that we are applauding you in everything that you are and do -- on this field when you are playing and off this field when you are just being the leaders that I know you are.
You wouldn't be able to be such a successful team if you weren't leaders in every way.
And the last point I'll make is this. One of the other things that we really are counting on for your leadership is to remind folks that we are a team, right? Everybody has a li- -- little bit that's different about them. But within the vast majority of us who have seemingly differences, the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And you guys know that. You know that in the way you operate as one team.
So, take that spirit with you in everything that you do. I'm counting on your leadership. Our nation is counting on you guys.
And go out and win some games. And I'll see you later. (Laughter.)
Okay. Thank you. (Applause.)

    Vice President of the United States: 2021-2025
  
  

  
    Remarks by the Vice President and Governor Tim Walz at a Campaign Event in Rochester, Pennsylvania
  


  

  
    August 18, 2024  

  
    GOVERNOR WALZ: Oh, man -- (applause) -- it is.
Doug gets the bro hugs. He brings it, so -- (laughter). Well, thank you, and it's true.
And -- and to Gwen and Doug, both, I -- all of you -- none of us do this alone. We're all in this together.
I think this is a room that knows this campaign will be won in rooms just like this all across the country. (Applause.)
It will be run with people sitting on the phone banks in there, dialing numbers, and people picking up the phone on a Sunday and having somebody say, ""Do you have a minute to talk about the future of our country?"" That's a pretty big step to pick up that phone and talk. But listening to these folks in here, people are doing it. They're doing it.
And the thing I can tell you what Kamala Harris has brought to this for so many things -- from experience as a prosecutor to an attorney general to a United States senator to a vice president to the next President of the United States -- (applause) -- th- -- there's that resume, which is out -- without question, but the reason they're picking up the phone and the reason that they're standing thousand deep in 109 degree heat in Las Vegas is: She's bringing out the joy in the hearts of Americans. She's bringing out -- (applause) -- she's bringing out the kindness that ties us together, the decency, the vision of a better tomorrow.
And these -- (applause) -- each of these volunteers and the people who put it on, they all said it. They said it is so much better to be for for something rather than against something -- to be for the future, not going back. Those -- (applause) --that's what people know.
And we -- some of us who have less hair and are old enough -- can remember when you could go to Thanksgiving, watch a Steelers game with your relatives, and not complain about politics the whole time, not be on each other's neck -- (applause) -- because you shared a commitment to democracy, a commitment to personal freedoms, a commitment to public education, a commitment to infrastructure. (Applause.)
We don't call each other names. We don't do it. And we don't use the least fortunate amongst us as punchlines for our jokes because they're our neighbors. They're our neighbors. And so, you're getting an opportunity to see the best side of America.
And for the young people here, they maybe haven't seen a campaign like this because of COVID, because of things that's happening. This is a chance to bring out that joy, turn the page, and look to the future, this idea of going forward, so -- (applause).
Doug -- Doug is right. He told you my kids were backstage in awe. He didn't tell you they were probably in awe because they could not believe that I got through that thing and through that speech -- (laughter) -- that that was amazing to them. But I'll tell you what, they have felt part of this family, because they can feel the decency radiating off these people. They can see the commitment. They know that children matter. They know that family matters. They know that individuals matter.
And this leader knows that it's not any of government's business to be in your health care decisions. Those are your decisions. (Applause.)
And this is a leader who celebrates love in all forms that it comes by -- (applause) -- that we love each other.
And for the young people, you hear somebody talking about this: We have the right to send our children to school to be free from being shot dead in their classrooms. That's what it is. (Applause.)
And this is a nation -- can ensure clean water, clean air, and a bright future for our children.
So, I have to tell you, we've got 79 days. And you'll hear me say this -- Doug is going to correct me on this -- I say, ""That's easy. We can sleep when we're dead."" He s- -- (laughter) -- Doug said we can sleep on November 6th after this election is over, so he may be right. (Applause.)
But, look, coming into football country and being an old football coach, there's an old saying, ""You -- you don't hope you're going to win. You prepare to win. And you give it the best you've got. And you know when that game's over, you want to know you left it all on the field.""
And that's all we're asking. Let's leave it all on the field. Let's get this thing done, because -- (applause) -- because when my grandkids and your grandkids ask you about this -- because on Nomber -- November 6th, you were there: first time when you got to welcome madam president of the United States, Kamala Harris. (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Tim Walz! (Applause.)
Hey, everybody. (Laughs.) We're back, and we're going to keep coming back and we're going to keep coming back. (Applause.)
I want to thank -- I want to thank everybody.
I want to start with Tim Walz. Isn't he fantastic? (Applause.) I like to call him Coach Walz, and, you know, he is -- he's done so much for our country, and he's going to make an extraordinary vice president of the United States.
Gwen, I mean, girl, just -- you just killed it, I'm telling you. (Laughs.) I mean, you know, there's something -- I don't know -- my first-grade teacher, Mrs. Frances Wilson attended my law school graduation. I just love teachers. I think anyone who decides to become a teacher, it's just -- it's -- it's one of the greatest gifts that one has that they give. And I thank you, Gwen, for doing all that you have done. Thank you. (Applause.)
And my husband is -- Doug, you are doing so much and you've been traveling all over our country, and I want to thank you. And you are going to, yet again, make history as the first gentleman of the United States. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
There are a lot of incredible leaders here. I want to just, for a moment, mention my friend Bob Casey. (Applause.) You -- we have got to send him back to the United States Senate. For the time that I was in the United States Senate and worked with Bob -- I'm going to tell you something. You know, we had these -- we would have these meetings where all of the Democratic senators would get together for lunch, no cameras in the room. Bob, to- -- almost every time, was one of the ones who would stand up in that room with all the other senators from around the country talking about the working people of Pennsylvania and why we needed to have you in our mind when we were thinking about national policy every single day. That's who Bob Casey is. Let's send him back to the United States Senate. (Applause.)
Chris Deluzio, we want to thank you. (Applause.) What he is doing in the halls of Congress -- again, I mean, you send some fighters to D.C., Pennsylvania. You sent some fighters to D.C.
Your next attorney general -- DePasquale, where are you? (Applause.) I've done that work, I know what it requires, and you're going to be outstanding.
So, you've got a lot of work, Pennsylvania, on your shoulders right now that you're carrying and you who are here volunteering to do this work. And it's --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we're going to get it done. (Applause.)
And Malcolm Kenyatta knows exactly what I'm talking about. I see him almost every time I come into the state.
So, I want to just address you all right now, as the volunteers. You know, Tim said it: This campaign for us is really born out of love of country. We all here, we love our country, and we know our country is going to be as strong as our willingness to fight for it and to fight for what we stand for. (Applause.)
You know, when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. When you stand for working people, you fight for working people. When you stand for freedom, whether it be to make decisions about your own body or love who you love, you fight for those things. (Applause.) When you believe in ending child poverty, you fight for that. When you believe in what we need to do to lift up the middle class, you fight for the middle class. (Applause.)
These are the things we stand for, and these, therefore, are the things we fight for. And that's what our election is about.
Our election is about understanding the importance of this beautiful country of ours in terms of what we stand for around the globe as a democracy -- as a democracy.
We know there's a duality to the nature of democracy. On the one hand, incredible strength when it is intact; what it does for its people to protect and defend their rights, their liberty, and their freedom -- incredibly strong. And incredibly fragile. It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it.
And that's what this campaign is about. This campaign is about a recognition that, frankly, over the last several years, there's been this kind of perversion that has taken place, I think, which is to suggest --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- which is to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down when. When what we know is the real and true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. (Applause.)
That's what we see as strength. We know what strength looks like. That's what strength looks like. (Applause.) Anybody who's about beating down other people is a coward. (Applause.) This is what strength looks like.
So, we know what we are about. We know what we stand for.
And one of the beautiful things about these next 79 days is what the people in this room have already been doing and know. Let's build community. Let's reinforce community.
You all, as volunteers, what you know -- and we're going to spread the word -- is how you can look at the face of a perfect stranger and see in their face a neighbor; that we see in each other our connection, our interdependence -- what we see in each other -- which fortifies and reinforces that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. That's what this campaign is about.
Yes, it is about winning, and we will win -- and we will win -- and we will win -- (applause) -- God willing.
And through these next 79 days, we will continue to build community, build coalitions, and remind each other we are all in this together.
So, I thank you all so very much for what you are doing. (Applause.)
Now, let's get back to work, shall we? (Laughs.) (Applause.)

This is going to be a great week -- (applause) -- and I want to kick us off by celebrating our incredible president, Joe Biden -- (applause) -- who will be speaking later tonight.
Joe, thank you for your historic leadership, for your lifetime of service to our nation, and for all you will continue to do. We are forever grateful to you. (Applause.) Thank you, Joe.
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe!

And this November, we will come together and declare with one voice, as one people: We are moving forward -- (applause) -- with optimism, hope, and faith.

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Milwaukee, Wisconsin
  


  

  
    August 20, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good evening, Milwaukee! (Laughs.) (Applause.) And hello to everyone joining us from exciting Chicago.
The delegates at the Democratic National Convention -- well, they just completed their roll call. (Laughs.) (Applause.) And they have nominated Coach Walz and me to be the next vice president and president of the United States of America. (Applause.)
And I thank everyone there and here for believing in what we can do together. We are so honored to be your nominees.
This is a people-powered campaign, and together, we will chart a new way forward -- (applause) -- a future for freedom, opportunity, of optimism and faith.
So, to everyone in Chicago and across America, thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you.
And you're going to hear from our wonderful second gentleman shortly. I'll see you in two days, Chicago. (Applause.)
Hey, Milwaukee! (Laughs.) (Applause.)
Oh, it's good to be back in Milwaukee. So -- it's good to be back in Milwaukee. It really is. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Thank you, thank you, thank you.
So, as you know, the coach and I were together here in Wisconsin just two weeks ago -- (applause) -- and -- and the first rally after I announced that he would be my running mate. And it is so good to be back with all of you. (Applause.) So good to be back.
And today, of course, I always and also bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden. (Applause.) Wasn't he terrific last night? (Applause.)
And I know we are all deeply grateful for his lifetime of service to our nation. (Applause.) Thank you, Joe.
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Joe.
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe.
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, Wisconsin, we have 77 days until the election -- (applause) -- 77 days. And, look, we know this is going to be a tight race until the very end.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We're going to win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We have some hard work ahead of us. (Laughs.) (Applause.) We have hard work ahead of us, but we like hard work. Hard work is good work. (Applause.) (Laughs.)
(Inaudible.)
And with your help this November, we will win. (Applause.) We'll win.
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We will win. We will win.
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Because --
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And bec- -- we will because we're going to put in the hard work over the next 77 days. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You already won! You already won!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: No -- no, we haven't already won. Seventy-seven days of work to do, my friends. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
So, listen, make no mistake -- make no mistake: As we all know, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. This is not just about us versus Donald Trump. This is about two very different visions for our nation. One, ours, focused on the future; the other focused on the past. And, Wisconsin, we fight for the future. (Applause.) We fight for the future.
We believe in the future -- a future with affordable health care, a future with affordable childcare, a future with affordable housing and paid leave. That's the future we believe in. (Applause.)
We believe in a future where we build an opportunity economy, where every American has the opportunity to own a home, start a business, and build wealth, including intergenerational wealth. That's what we believe in. (Applause.)
We believe in the future of our country. We believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America's families. And when I am president, I will bring down the cost of groceries by making sure markets are competitive and fair. (Applause.)
Together with Coach, we will take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription medication for all Americans. (Applause.)
We will take on the high cost of housing, understanding so many people are trying to fulfill the American dream and we need to give people help to get there. (Applause.)
In fact, last week, I announced my plan to build millions of new homes and help first-time homebuyers with a down payment -- (applause) -- knowing that's a step to get where we need to go.
And my tax plan will give 100 million more Americans a tax cut, including $6,000 to families during the first year of a child's life. (Applause.) That's about help with a car seat, with a crib, with diapers, with baby clothes.
If we care about children, then let's help people -- help people -- (applause) -- do what they naturally want to do but don't always have the resources to do it.
And unlike Donald Trump, I will always put the middle class and working families first. (Applause.)
But now we know he has a different plan -- Trump. Right? Just look at Project 2025.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Now, if he is elected, understand what that -- you know, by the way, can you believe they put that thing in writing, right?
So, that plan, though, tells us what they're up to. Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he wants to impose what is, in effect, a national sales tax, which will cost a typical family $3,900 a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Understand that.
And on top of all of this, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And you remember what that was like, when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions? Do you remember what that was? Breast cancer survivors, children with diabetes, grandparents who need help and support being denied care.
We're not going back. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are not going back. We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We will move forward. Just like Wisconsin's state motto tells us: Forward! (Applause.) Forward.
Ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom. (Applause.) And it is a fight for freedom, like the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body
and not have her government telling her what to do. (Applause.)
You know, I don't know what's up with these people, by the way. I mean, they just seemingly don't trust women.
Well, we trust women. (Applause.) We trust women.
And we know how we got to this place. We know how we got to this place, with now over 20 -- over 20 Trump abortion bans. We know how we got here. The former president, Trump, hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- with the intention -- with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And then, in state after state, they proposed and passed laws to punish women, criminalize health care providers -- in some states, not even making an exception for rape or incest.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And just yesterday, when he was asked if he has any regrets about ending Roe v. Wade, Donald Trump -- Donald Trump, without even a moment's hesitation -- you would think you would reflect on it for a second -- (laughter) -- said no. ""No regrets.""
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And that's because -- I do believe, you know, bad behavior should result in a consequence. (Applause.)
Well, we will make sure he does face a consequence, and that will be at the ballot box in November -- (applause) -- in November -- in November.
And I promise you, when I am president of the United States and Congress passes a bill -- (applause) -- to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.)
And, Wisconsin, in addition to that, as you all know, we are witnessing across our nation a full-on attack on hard-fought, hard-won, fundamental freedoms and rights -- across our nation -- like the freedom to vote -- (applause); the freedom to be safe from gun violence -- (applause); the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.)
So, we know what we're dealing with in this moment. And we must remember: As the generations of Americans before us who led the fight for freedom, the baton is now in our hands. (Applause.) We carry the baton. We carry the baton.
And so much is on the line in this election. And understand -- we have to understand something: This is not 2016 or 2020. This is not 2016 or 2020. And, in particular, the stakes are higher for a lot of reasons, because we know what he does when he's in office, but including that, last month, the Supreme Court of the United States basically told the former president that he will effectively be immune --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- for what he does in the White House.
Now, think about what that means. Think about what that means, knowing the individual we're talking about.
Donald Trump has openly vowed to be a dictator on day one.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He has openly indicated his intention to weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Think about what we know about him and what he's told us. He even called for, quote -- quote, ""the termination of the Constitution of the United States.""
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, let us be very clear. Somebody who intends to terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again have the opportunity to stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. (Applause.) Never again.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We're not going back. We're going forward.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We're not going back.
So -- Tim just looked at me and said, ""We're not going back, I think."" (Laughter.)
So, Milwaukee, here's the thing, as you all know. It's why you are here. It's why you have taken the time to be here this evening. It all comes down --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Kamala, I love you!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I love you back. And it all comes down to this. (Applause.) We're here -- thank you. But, yeah -- thank you. (Applause.)
But here's the thing. Here's the thing. The reason that we are all here together, spending this time together, truly and deeply, is because we love our country. We love -- we love our country. (Applause.) We believe in our country. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We believe in our country.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right.
And I do believe -- I do believe that it is the highest form of patriotism -- the highest form of patriotism to then fight for the ideals of our country. And that's what we are here to do. (Applause.)
And that -- and that -- and that is how we fulfill the promise of America -- (applause) -- the promise of America. And it is that promise of America --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Medical!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We need a medical assistant here. Okay. We need a nurse. We need a medic here, please.
Let's just make a -- let's make a path. Let's make a path, if you all don't mind. Just let's make a path to right here. Let's just create a path to right here. Let's create a path. (Applause.)
Let's create a path, guys. And thanks for looking out each other -- look out for each other. But let's -- let's create a path for the medics. Okay. (Applause.)
Okay. (Applause.) You okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. We're going to be okay. We're going to be okay. All right. (Applause.) Okay. We're going to be okay.
This is who we are, right? This is what we're about: looking out for each other. The thing -- we care about each other. (Applause.)
You know, it's about truly understanding what ""love thy neighbor"" means. (Applause.) It's about, in the face of a perfect stranger, seeing a neighbor, understanding what that love of each other means. (Applause.) It's a big difference between what we're talking about and what's on the other side.
So, listen, I'll just -- I'll end with this point: the promise of America. The promise of America is what we are fighting for, and it is that promise that I think makes it possible that Coach Governor Walz and I would be sharing the same ticket. Think about that. (Applause.) Think about that. Think about it in the context of the promise of America.
Two middle-class kids. One born in Oakland, California, to a working mom. The other, a son of the Nebraska plains who grew up working on a farm. (Applause.) I worked at a McDonald's. (Laughter and applause.)
But only in America -- only in America is it possible for them together to make it all the way to the White House. (Applause.) Only in America. Only in America. (Applause.)
So, my last point is this. In this election, we each face a question. And that question is: What kind of country do we want to live in? Right?
Do we want to live in a country of chaos and fear and hate --
AUDIENCE: No!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- no -- or a country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law? (Applause.)
And the beauty -- the beauty of our democracy -- listen, the beauty of our democracy is we each have the power to answer that question. Each and every one of us has the power to answer that question. (Applause.) Each one of us.
That's our power. The power is with the people. (Applause.)
So, Wisconsin, today, I ask: Are you ready to have your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight --
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win.
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. God bless you. (Applause.)

    The Vice President: Good evening! [Laughs.] [Applause.]
Audience: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
The Vice President: California. [Laughs.] [Applause.]
Good evening, everyone. Good evening. [Laughs.] [Applause.] Good evening. [Laughs.] [Applause.]
Oh, my goodness. [Applause.]
Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Go- — [laughs]. [Applause.] Good evening. Thank you. [Applause.]

Okay, we've got to get to some business. We've got to get to some business.
Okay. Thank you all. [Applause.] Okay. [Laughs.] Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. [Applause.] Thank you, thank you. Please. Thank you. [Applause.]
Please. Thank you so very much. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. [Applause.]
Okay, let's get to business. Let's get to business. All right. [Laughs.] [Applause.]
So, let me start by thanking my most incredible husband, Doug — [applause] — for being an incredible partner to me, an incredible father to Cole and Ella. And happy anniversary, Dougie. [Laughs.] [Applause.] I love you so very much.
To our president, Joe Biden — [applause] — when I think about the path that we have traveled together, Joe, I am filled with gratitude. Your record is extraordinary, as history will show, and your character is inspiring. And Doug and I love you and Jill and are forever thankful to you both. [Applause.]
And to Coach Tim Walz — [applause] — you are going to be an incredible vice president. [Applause.]
And to the delegates and everyone who has put your faith in our campaign, your support is humbling.
So, America, the path that led me here in recent weeks was no doubt unexpected, but I'm no stranger to unlikely journeys.
So, my mother, our mother, Shyamala Harris, had one of her own. And I miss her every day and especially right now. And I know she's looking down smiling. [Applause.] I know that.
So, my mother was 19 when she crossed the world alone, traveling from India to California with an unshakable dream to be the scientist who would cure breast cancer. [Applause.]
When she finished school, she was supposed to return home to a traditional arranged marriage, but as fate would have it, she met my father, Donald Harris, a student from Jamaica. [Applause.] They — they fell in love and got married, and that act of self-determination made my sister Maya and me. [Applause.]
Growing up, we moved a lot. I will always remember that big Mayflower truck packed with all our belongings, ready to go to Illinois; to Wisconsin — [applause]; and wherever our parents' jobs took us.
My early memories of our parents together are very joyful ones: a home filled with laughter and music — Aretha, Coltrane, and Miles. At the park, my mother would say, ""Stay close."" But my father would say, as he smiled, ""Run, Kamala, run. Don't be afraid. Don't let anything stop you."" [Applause.] From my earliest years, he taught me to be fearless.
But the harmony between my parents did not last. When I was in elementary school, they split up, and it was mostly my mother who raised us.
Before she could finally afford to buy a home, she rented a small apartment in the East Bay. In the bay — [applause] — in the Bay, you either live in the Hills or the Flatlands. We lived in the Flats, a beautiful working-class neighborhood of firefighters, nurses, and construction workers — [applause] — all who tended their lawns with pride.
My mother, she worked long hours. And like many working parents, she leaned on a trusted circle to help raise us: Mrs. Shelton, who ran the daycare below us and became a second mother; Uncle Sherman; Aunt Mary; Uncle Freddy; Auntie Kris. None of them family by blood and all of them family by love. [Applause.]
Family who taught us how to make gumbo, how to play chess — and sometimes even let us win. Family who loved us, believed in us, and told us we could be anything and do anything. [Applause.]
They instilled in us the values they personified: community, faith, and the importance of treating others as you would want to be treated — with kindness, respect, and compassion. [Applause.]
My mother was a brilliant, five-foot-tall brown woman with an accent. [Applause.] And as the eldest child — as the eldest child, I saw how the world would sometimes treat her. But my mother never lost her cool. She was tough, courageous, a trailblazer in the fight for women's health. And she taught Maya and me a lesson that Michelle mentioned the other night. She taught us to never complain about injustice, but do something about it. Do something about it. [Applause.] That was my mother.
And she taught us — and she always — she also taught us — and she also taught us ""and never do anything half-assed."" [Applause.] And that is a direct quote — [laughs] — a direct quote.
I grew up immersed in the ideals of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents had met at a civil rights gathering. And they made sure that we learned about civil rights leaders, including the lawyers, like Thurgood Marshall and C- — Constance Baker Motley — those who battled in the courtroom to make real the promise of America.
So, at a young age, I decided I wanted to do that work. I wanted to be a lawyer. And when it came time to choose the type of law I would pursue, I reflected on a pivotal moment in my life.
You see, when I was in high school, I started to notice something about my best friend, Wanda. She was sad at school, and there were times she didn't want to go home.
So, one day, I asked if everything was all right, and she confided in me that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather. And I immediately told her she had to come stay with us, and she did. [Applause.]
This is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor — to protect people like Wanda — because I believe everyone has a right to safety, to dignity, and to justice. [Applause.]
As a prosecutor, when I had a case, I charged it not in the name of the victim but in the name of the people for a simple reason: In our system of justice, a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us. [Applause.]
And I would often explain this to console survivors of crime, to remind them no one should be made to fight alone. We are all in this together. [Applause.]
And every day in the courtroom, I stood proudly before a judge and I said five words: ""Kamala Harris, for the people."" [Applause.]
And to be clear — and to be clear, my entire career, I've only had one client: the people. [Applause.]
And so, on behalf of the people; on behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender, or the language your grandmother speaks; on behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey; on behalf of Americans like the people I grew up with — people who work hard, chase their dreams, and look out for one another; on behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth, I accept your nomination to be president of the United States of America. [Applause.]
And with this election — and — [laughs] — and with this election, our nation — our nation, with this election, has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past; a chance to chart a new way forward — [applause] — not — not as members of any one party or faction but as Americans. [Applause.]
And let me say, I know there are people of various political views watching tonight, and I want you to know I promise to be a president for all Americans. [Applause.] You can always trust me to put country above party and self; to hold sacred America's fundamental principles, from the rule of law to free and fair elections to the peaceful transfer of power. [Applause.]
I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations. A president who leads and listens; who is realistic, practical, and has common sense; and always fights for the American people. [Applause.]
From the courthouse to the White House, that has been my life's work. [Applause.]
As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, California — [applause] — I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them.
As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks — [applause] — delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure and helped pass a homeowner bill of rights, one of the first of its kind in the nation. [Applause.]
I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for-profit colleges — [applause] — for workers who were being cheated out of their wages, the wages they were due — [applause] — for seniors facing elder abuse.
I fought against the cartels who traffic in guns and drugs and human beings — [applause] — who threaten the security of our border and the safety of our communities.
And I will tell you, these fights were not easy and neither were the elections that put me in those offices.
We were underestimated at practically every turn,
but we never gave up, because the future is always worth fighting for. [Applause.] And that's the fight we are in right now: a fight for America's future. [Applause.]
Fellow Americans, this election is not only the most important of our lives, it is one of the most important in the life of our nation. [Applause.]
In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man. [Laughter.] But the consequences — but the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious. [Applause.]
Consider — consider not only the chaos and calamity when he was in office but also the gravity of what has happened since he lost the last election.
Donald Trump tried to throw away your votes. When he failed, he sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol, where they assaulted law enforcement officers.
When politicians in his own party begged him to call off the mob and send help, he did the opposite. He fanned the flames.
And now, for an entirely different set of crimes, he was found guilty of fraud by a jury of everyday Americans — [applause] — and separately — and separately found liable for committing sexual abuse.
And consider — consider what he intends to do if we give him power again. Consider his explicit intent to set free violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers at the Capitol; his explicit intent to jail journalists, political opponents, and anyone he sees as the enemy; his explicit intent to deploy our active-duty military against our own citizens.
Audience: Booo --
The Vice President: Consider — consider the power he will have, especially after the United States Supreme Court just ruled that he would be immune from criminal prosecution.
Audience: Booo --
The Vice President: Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails.
Audience: Booo --
The Vice President: And how he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States not to improve your life, not to strengthen our national security, but to serve the only client he has ever had: himself. [Applause.]
And we know — and we know what a second Trump term would look like. It's all laid out in Project 2025, written by his closest advisers. And its sum total is to pull our country back to the past. But, America --
Audience: We are not going back!
The Vice President: — we are not going back. [Applause.]
We are not going back. We are not going back.
Audience: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
The Vice President: We are not going back to when Donald Trump tried to cut Social Security and Medicare.
We are not going back to when he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions.
We are not going to let him eliminate the Department of Education that funds our public schools. [Applause.]
We are not going to let him end programs like Head Start that provide preschool and childcare for our children. [Applause.]
America, we are not going back.
Audience: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
The Vice President: And we are charting — and we are charting a new way forward — [applause] — forward to a future with a strong and growing middle class, because we know a strong middle class has always been critical to America's success. And building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. [Applause.]
And I'll tell you, this is personal for me. The middle class is where I come from. My mother kept a strict budget. We lived within our means, yet we wanted for little. And she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us and to be grateful for them, because, as she taught us, opportunity is not available to everyone.
That's why we will create what I call an opportunity economy — an opportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed — [applause] — whether you live in a rural area, small town, or big city.
And as president, I will bring together labor and workers — [applause] — and small-business owners and entrepreneurs and American companies to create jobs, to grow our economy, and to lower the cost of everyday needs like health care and housing and groceries.
We will provide access to capital for small-business owners and entrepreneurs and founders. [Applause.] And we will end America's housing shortage — [applause] — and protect Social Security and Medicare. [Applause.]
Now compare that to Donald Trump, because I think everyone here knows he doesn't actually fight for the middle class. Not — he doesn't actually fight for the middle class. Instead, he fights for himself and his billionaire friends. And he will give them another round of tax breaks that will add --
Audience: Booo --
The Vice President: — up to $5 trillion to the national debt.
Audience: Booo --
The Vice President: And all the while, he intends to enact what in effect is a national sales tax — call it a ""Trump tax"" — that would raise prices on middle-class families by almost $4,000 a year.
Audience: Booo --
The Vice President: Well, instead of a Trump tax hike, we will pass a middle-class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans. [Applause.]
Friends, I believe America cannot truly be prosperous unless Americans are fully able to make their own decisions about their own lives, especially on matters of heart and home. [Applause.] But tonight, in America, too many women are not able to make those decisions.
And let's be clear about how we got here. Donald Trump handpicked members of the United States Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom.
Audience: Booo --
The Vice President: And now he brags about it. In his words, quote, ""I did it, and I'm proud to have done it."" End quote.
Audience: Booo --
The Vice President: Well, I'll tell you, over the past two years, I've traveled across our country, and women have told me their stories. Husbands and fathers have shared theirs.
Stories of women miscarrying in a parking lot, developing sepsis, losing the ability to ever again have children, all because doctors are afraid they may go to jail for caring for their patients. Couples just trying to grow their family, cut off in the middle of IVF treatments. Children who have survived sexual assault potentially being forced to carry a pregnancy to term.
This is what's happening in our country because of Donald Trump. And understand, he is not done. As a part of his agenda, he and his allies would limit access to birth control, ban medication abortion, and enact a nationwide abortion ban, with or without Congress.
Audience: Booo --
And get this. Get this. He plans to create a national anti-abortion coordinator and force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions.
Audience: Booo --
The Vice President: Simply put, they are out of their minds. [Applause.]
And one must ask — one must ask: Why exactly is it that they don't trust women? Well, we trust women. We trust women. [Applause.]
And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. [Applause.]
In this election, many other fundamental freedoms are at stake: the freedom to live safe from gun violence in our schools, communities, and places of worship; the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride — [applause]; the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis — [applause]; and the freedom that unlocks all the others, the freedom to vote. [Applause.]
With this election, we finally have the opportunity to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. [Applause.]
And let me be clear. And let me be clear. After decades in law enforcement, I know the importance of safety and security, especially at our border.
Last year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades. The Border Patrol endorsed it. But Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign, so he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal.
Audience: Booo --
The Vice President: Well, I refuse to play politics with our security, and here is my pledge to you. As president, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed, and I will sign it into law. [Applause.]
I know — I know we can live up to our proud heritage as a nation of immigrants and reform our broken immigration system. [Applause.]
We can create an earned pathway to citizenship and secure our border. [Applause.]
And, America, we must also be steadfast in advancing our security and values abroad.
As vice president, I have confronted threats to our security, negotiated with foreign leaders, strengthened our alliances, and engaged with our brave troops overseas. [Applause.]
As commander in chief, I will ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world. [Applause.] And I will fulfill our sacred obligation to care for our troops and their families, and I will always honor and never disparage their service and their sacrifice. [Applause.]
Audience: USA! USA! USA!
The Vice President: I will make sure that we lead the world into the future on space and artificial intelligence; that America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century; and that we strengthen, not abdicate, our global leadership.
Trump, on the other hand, threatened to abandon NATO. He encouraged Putin to invade our allies. Said Russia could, quote, ""do whatever the hell they want.""
Audience: Booo --
The Vice President: Five days before Russia attacked Ukraine, I met with President Zelenskyy to warn him about Russia's plan to invade. I helped mobilize a global response — over 50 countries — to defend against Putin's aggression. [Applause.] And as president, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO Allies. [Applause.]
With respect to the war in Gaza, President Biden and I are working around the clock, because now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done. [Applause.]
And let me be clear. And let me be clear. I will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself — [applause] — and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself, because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on October 7 — [applause] — including unspeakable sexual violence and the massacre of young people at a music festival.
At the same time, what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. [Applause.] Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking.
President Biden and I are working to end this war, such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination. [Applause.]
And know this: I will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend our forces and our interests against Iran and Iran-backed terrorists. I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong Un, who are rooting for Trump — who are rooting for Trump. [Applause.]
Because, you know, they know — they know he is easy to manipulate with flattery and favors. They know Trump won't hold autocrats accountable because he wants to be an autocrat himself. [Applause.]
And as president, I will never waver in defense of America's security and ideals, because in the enduring struggle between democracy and tyranny, I know where I stand and I know where the United States belongs. [Applause.]
Audience: USA! USA! USA!
The Vice President: So, fellow Americans — fellow Americans, I — I love our country with all my heart. [Applause.]
Everywhere I go — everywhere I go, in everyone I meet, I see a nation that is ready to move forward, ready for the next step in the incredible journey that is America.
I see an America where we hold fast to the fearless belief that built our nation and inspired the world — that here, in this country, anything is possible; that nothing is out of reach. An America where we care for one another, look out for one another, and recognize that we have so much more in common than what separates us. [Applause.] That none of us — none of us has to fail for all of us to succeed. [Applause.] And that in unity, there is strength.
You know, our opponents in this race are out there every day denigrating America, talking about how terrible everything is. Well, my mother had another lesson she used to teach: Never let anyone tell you who you are; you show them who you are. [Applause.]
America, let us show each other and the world who we are and what we stand for: freedom, opportunity, compassion, dignity, fairness, and endless possibilities. [Applause.]
We are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the history of the world. And on behalf of our children and our grandchildren and all those who sacrificed so dearly for our freedom and liberty, we must be worthy of this moment.
It is now our turn to do what generations before us have done, guided by optimism and faith: to fight for this country we love, to fight for the ideals we cherish, and to uphold the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth — the privilege and pride of being an American. [Applause.]
So, let's get out there, let's fight for it. Let's get out there, let's vote for it. And together, let us write the next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told. [Applause.]
Thank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you all. [Applause.]

    Vice President of the United States: 2021-2025
  
  

  
    Remarks by the Vice President and Governor Tim Walz at a Marching Band Practice in Hinesville, Georgia
  


  

  
    August 28, 2024  

  
    GOVERNOR WALZ: Thank you all. Director Sohayda, thank you for that. To the staff that's here -- my -- my previous job to this was, of course, public school teacher and coach, which I wear with pride. To all of you, thank you. Thanks for having us in your school.
And thanks to all teams that are here. I think you kind of embody this idea -- and the vice president talks a lot about it -- each of our individual talents, what we can contribute, but something bigger than ourselves when you get together. Your single instrument alone is an amazing thing, but as part of this band, it becomes really amazing.
And then to see a school community, each and every one of these teams -- I said I coach football a lot -- but all of this is part of doing something bigger. And I think having us in here, stressing why the vice president says it often, that education is the key to the middle class, a pathway to the middle class. And it shouldn't be burdening you with debt; it should give you an opportunity to get there.
So, I think when we can get into a public school like this, when we're able to see you and tell you, it's not just -- the teachers here tell you. They know; they do this work. It's not a cliché. This is truly about building towards the future, and you're that future.
And so, when we're in a room like this, it lifts everybody's spirits; it lifts the country's spirits. And the vice president talks about that often, about the positive and the joyful work that we can do and the things that we're trying to make sure happen.
So, I'm just grateful that you have us here. I'm grateful to be part of the team with a really great head coach here in your next president of the United States, Kamala Harris. (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughter.) So, you know, I've been hearing about you incredible young leaders for quite some time -- from the players, to those who are bringing joy, to everybody in the stands, to the music that you guys are creating.
And so, we wanted to come by just to let you know that our country is counting on you -- all of you. You are leaders by the very fact that you all are here in this room doing what you do at this incredible school, doing it as one big team, understanding all of the different parts that fit together to create a team.
You are doing some of the best work any leader can do. And we're so proud of you, and we're counting you. Your generation, all that you guys stand for, everything you have at stake is what is going to propel our country into the next era of what we can do and what we can be.
And I want to say to you that you must always lead as you have chosen to lead, understanding you don't have to ask anybody's permission to lead. And I think you all have figured that out. You've decided to be a leader. And in doing that, you are also role models. Right? Welcome to the role model club. (Laughter.)
And being a role model -- right? -- means that there are going to be members of your family, people who live in your neighborhood, your classmates who watch you to see, ""Oh, that's how it's done."" And in that way, you are showing what hard work can achieve, what discipline can achieve, what teamwork can achieve. And that's the stuff of great leadership -- all of you.
And so, we wanted to come by to remind you that our nation is counting on you. We're so proud of you and everything you have achieved.
And I will tell you, I was in band when I was your age. (Laughter.) So, I know a little bit about -- you know, Coach knows about the players. Right? And all that you all are doing, it requires a whole lot of rehearsal, a whole lot of practice, long hours. Right? Sometimes you hit the note; sometimes you don't. (Laughter.) Right?
But all that practice makes for beautiful music. And that is a metaphor that is symbolic for everything that you all will do in your lives, which is you're going to show what a winning team looks like; you're going to show what it means to put yourself out on the field, to put yourself in front of people, to have the confidence to do it. Sometimes you're going to hit the step right; sometimes you're not. Sometimes you're going to win the game; sometimes you may not.
But, you know, you never let any circumstance knock you down or slow you down. You just keep going at it. That's who you are, and that's why we are so confident in everything that you are doing and will continue to do for our country.
So, just keep being you and all of the excellence that you're bringing to everything you do. Okay?
All right. See you later. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Savannah, Georgia
  


  

  
    August 29, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, Savannah! (Applause.)
Good afternoon. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
Good afternoon, Savannah. (Applause.) Good afternoon.
Oh, good afternoon. Oh, it's good to be back in Savannah. Good afternoon. (Applause.) (Laughs.)
Can we please hear it for Katelyn and her incredible -- (applause) -- for her incredible leadership?
Look, when I look out at our young leaders like Katelyn, I know our future is so bright. It is so bright. (Applause.)
I want to thank Mayor Johnson. (Applause.) Thank you for your -- there you are. We've been hanging out for the last two days. Mayor, I thank you so very much for your leadership. Thank you. (Applause.)
Congresswoman Nikema Williams, the chair of the Democratic Party of Georgia -- (applause) -- for your friendship and your sisterhood.
And to all the leaders with us today, good afternoon. Good afternoon. (Applause.) Good afternoon.
I also bring greetings from our president and a great friend of the state of Georgia, Joe Biden. (Applause.) And let us also send our love to the great president from the state of Georgia, Jimmy Carter. (Applause.)
So, Georgia --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I love you back. (Applause.) I love you back.
And we have 68 days to go until this election -- 68 days to go. (Applause.) And I think you all have spent your time here sacrificing all your other obligations to be here together, us as one community, knowing we all have so much more in common than what separates us. And I thank you for taking that time. (Applause.)
And, listen -- so, we're here to speak truth, and one of the things that we know: This is going to be a tight race until the very end. Okay? So, let's not pay too much attention to the polls, because we are running as the underdog. Okay? (Applause.) And we have some hard work ahead of us, but we like hard work. Hard work is good work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work.
And with your help, we are going to win this November. (Applause.) We are going to win this November. Yes, we will.
So, look, Georgia, let me say, I'm no stranger to tough fights. Before I was elected vice president, before I was elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and, before that, an elected district attorney. (Applause.) And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. (Applause.)
So, every day in the courtroom, I stood proudly before a judge and I spoke five words: ""Kamala Harris, for the people."" (Applause.)
My entire career, I've only had one client: the people. (Applause.)
I stood for women and children against predators who abused them. I took on the big banks and delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure. (Applause.) I fought against cartels who traffic in guns, drugs, and human beings. And I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for-profit colleges -- (applause) -- for workers who were being cheated out of the wages they were due, and for seniors facing elder abuse.
And I will tell you, those fights were not easy, and neither were the elections that put me in those offices. But we never gave up, because the future is always worth fighting for. (Applause.) Always. And that is the fight we are in right now: a fight for America's future.
We -- we fight for a future with affordable childcare, paid leave, and affordable health care. (Applause.) And on that last subject, let's finally expand Medicaid in Georgia -- (applause) -- so people can take their child to a doctor or go to an emergency room without going into medical debt. (Applause.)
We -- we fight for a future where we build what I call an ""opportunity economy"" so that every American has the opportunity to own a home, to start a business, and to build wealth and intergenerational wealth -- (applause) -- and a future where we lower the cost of living for America's families. (Applause.)
So, when I was attorney general, I went after price-fixing schemes.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And -- love you back. Love you back. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
And I will tell you, when we get this done together, my friend -- (laughter) -- and when I am president, I will take on the bad actors who exploit a crisis -- (applause) -- to rip off consumers on everyday items -- who rip off consumers on everyday items, like groceries. I will take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs and insulin for all Americans. (Applause.) I will take on the high cost of housing and work with developers to cut the red tape and build millions of new homes. (Applause.)
And I will give 100 million Americans a tax cut, including $6,000 to families during the first year of their child's life -- (applause) -- understanding folks just need a little help from time to time. And it's not about just getting by; it's about getting ahead. Six thousand dollars in the first year of a child's life to help pay for that car seat or the crib or the baby clothes. (Applause.)
And unlike Donald Trump, I will always put the middle-class and working-class families first. (Applause.) Always.
I come from the middle class; I know what I'm talking about.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And, Savannah, so -- but we got some work to do. Okay? We got some work to do, because we know Donald Trump has a very different plan. He has a very different plan.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Just look at his Project 2025 agenda.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. If he is elected, Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. He intends --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he wants to impose what, in effect, is a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities. And it will cost -- the economists will tell you -- it will cost a typical American family nearly $4,000 a year.
So, Georgia, on top of all of this, if Donald Trump wins in November, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- to take us back to a time when insurance companies --
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are not -- we're going forward. (Laughs.)
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And the reason we know we can't go back -- to your point, the reason we know we can't go back: On the issue of the Affordable Care Act, remember what that was like before we had the Affordable Care Act?
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Remember when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions? Remember what that was like? Children with asthma. Breast cancer survivors. Grandparents with diabetes.
So, yeah, we're not going back. (Applause.) We're not going back. We're not going back. And we will move forward. (Applause.)
Ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom, like the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
And understand how we got here. When he was president, Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did just as he intended. And now more than 20 states have a Trump abortion ban, including Georgia.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: In fact, every state in the South except for Virginia has a Trump abortion ban.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And think about that -- many with no exceptions even for rape and incest. That is immoral -- immoral. (Applause.)
And let us all agree: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do. (Applause.) Come on. Come on. Come on.
And if he wins, Donald Trump will go further. He will sign a national abortion ban, you best believe. And he would create a national antiabortion coordinator and force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions. It's right there in Project 2025.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Simply put: They are out of their minds. (Applause.)
Why don't they trust women? Well, we trust women. (Applause.) And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly. (Applause.)
And across our nation, in addition to that, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard-won fundamental freedoms and rights. (Applause.)
(Protester interruption.)
Hey, let me -- let me ju- -- let me just say something. Let -- hold on. Hold up. Hold up for a second. Hold up for a second. Let me -- let me just say something. Let me just say something.
We are fighting for our democracy. Everyone has a right and should have their voices heard.
I am speaking now, but on the subject, I will say this. The president and I are working around the clock. We have got to get a hostage deal done and get a ceasefire done now. (Applause.)
So, back to this election and Donald Trump. So, in addition to the fight on the fundamental freedom to make decisions about one's own body, I have been traveling our country, and the people of Georgia know what I know: There is a full-on assault on hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights, including the freedom to vote --
(Protestor interruption.)
-- the freedom to be safe from gun violence, and an attack on the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.)
And we will fight against all of that, including the freedom to live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis. (Applause.)
Here is the thing. Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Now, Savannah, the baton is in our hands. (Applause.)
So, we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. (Applause.) We who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass universal background checks and red flag laws. (Applause.)
So much is on the line in this election. So much is on the line. And understand, this is not 2016 or 2020. Things are different. A lot is the same when we think about the issues, and then there is significant differences.
The stakes in 2024 are even higher, because consider that the United States Supreme Court recently just basically told the former president that, going forward, he will be effectively immune, no matter what he does in the White House.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Now just imagine --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Lock him up!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, the -- the courts are going to take care of that. We are going to get him out of -- we are going to elect ourselves and everybody here in November. (Applause.)
But I mention the Supreme Court ruling because understand what this means. Just imagine. Before there was at least the threat of consequence. Understand what it now means, and imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails.
Imagine what that means when you consider he has openly vowed that, if reelected, on day one, he will be a dictator --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- that he would end -- that he would end the independence of the Department of Justice so he could have unchecked power and seek vengeance against people who disagree with him.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He even called for termination of the United States Supreme -- the cou- -- the -- the supreme land [law] of our nation: the United States Constitution. Think about what that means.
And let us be very clear. Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States of America. (Applause.) Never again.
So, it all comes down to this. We are all here together, spending this time together because we love our country. We love our country. We love our country. (Applause.) And we know the privilege and pride -- the privilege and pride that comes with being American. (Applause.)
And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. (Applause.) That is how we realize the promise of America.
Georgia, for the past two election cycles, voters in this very state, you who are here, have delivered. You sent two extraordinary senators to Washington, D.C. (Applause.) You sent President Biden and me to the White House. (Applause.) You showed up, you knocked on doors, you registered folks to vote, and you made it happen. You did that. You did that. (Applause.)
And so, now we are asking you to do it again. (Applause.) Let's do it again. Let's do it again.
So, Savannah, are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe an opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight --
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win.
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

You know, ours -- as we talk about it, because it's just what it is -- we are a people-powered campaign. And it is about understanding the power of each one of us to lift folks up, to let them know they are seen, they are heard.
I think there's so much that has happened in our country that makes people feel like they're alone or they're not seen or that we have nothing in common when, in fact, we all know we have so much more in common than what separates us.
But you guys are doing the work on the ground, and I cannot thank you enough. We -- I was just with Governor Walz -- Coach Walz. He just left. He's moving up on to -- to North Carolina, but he sends his greetings as well, as does our president.
But thank you all. (Applause.)

It's always been that way, right? The way we celebrate Labor Day is we know that hard work is good work. We know that when we organize, when we bring everyone together, it's a joyful moment where we are committed to doing the hard work of lifting up America's families.
And I want to thank everyone here for that work and the way you do it every day, including General President Booker of the Laborers' -- (applause); President Fain of UAW -- (applause); President Pringle of NEA -- (applause); President Slevin of the Utility Workers -- (applause); and President Weingarten of the AFT. (Applause.)
And thank you to all of the union members who are here this afternoon.
So, on Labor Day and every day, we celebrate the dignity of work -- the dignity of work. We celebrate unions, because unions helped build America and unions helped build America's middle class. (Applause.)
It is true across our nation, and it is true here in Detroit. Nearly 140 years ago, in this very city, 10,000 people marched in one of our nation's first Labor Day parades. Many held signs that read ""Divided, we can beg. United, we can demand."" (Applause.)
For generations, in Detroit and across our nation, the brothers and sisters of labor have stood together to righteously demand fair pay, better benefits, and safe working conditions. And let me say, every person in our nation has benefited from that work. (Applause.)
Everywhere I go, I tell people: Look, you may not be a union member. You better thank a union member -- (applause) -- for the five-day workweek. You better thank a union member for sick leave. You better thank a union member for paid leave. You better thank a union member for vacation time. (Applause.)
Because what we know is when union wages go up, everybody's wages go up. (Applause.) When union workplaces are safer, every workplace is safer. (Applause.) When unions are strong, America is strong. (Applause.)
We know what we're talking about. The labor movement has always understood the power of the collective and the power of unity -- the power of unity.
And while we are fighting so much nonsense that is about trying to divide our country, trying to pull us apart, look to what the history and the present of labor tells us about the power of the collective and unity -- the spirit of that work, as much as the product of that work. It's very telling and gives us really good lessons about what creates strength.
And, you know, many of you know, my parents met while they were active in the Civil Rights Movement. So, when I was young, my parents -- because I see some young leaders here today -- when I was young, my parents would take me to the meetings -- I see our young leaders -- (applause) -- and -- and take me to the marches. I was in a stroller.
And from a very young age, I learned that when people stand together, when we join voices, knowing that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us -- when we join those voices, we can drive extraordinary change, which is why I believe in my heart and soul no one should ever be made to fight alone. We are all in this together. (Applause.) We are all in this together.
But I'll tell you, I think that there has been a certain backward-thinking approach over the last several years, which is to suggest -- some folks, them folks -- to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what we know: The true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up -- who you lift up. (Applause.) That's the measure of the strength of a leader. Let's stop with the nonsense.
And in this election, we all here know there are two very different visions for our nation. Ours, focused on the future; the other, focused --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) Let's just get through the next 64 days. How about -- (laughs). (Applause.)
And ours -- yes, my dear brother -- is focused on the future, and theirs is focused on the past. And we fight for the future. We fight for a future where all people receive dignity and respect and opportunity for -- not just for some but for all. That's what we are fighting for.
And so, we are 64 days out from the election day. And in Michigan, mail-in absentee voting starts in 24 days -- (applause) -- 24 days.
So, this election -- this election and our fight is a fight for the promise of America, a promise --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I love you back. (Applause.)
And ours is a fight for the promise -- the promise of America -- a promise of freedom, of opportunity, and justice not just for some but for all. (Applause.)
But what we know is, as we fight to move our nation forward, Donald Trump intends to pull us back to the past.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But we're not going back. We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So -- and let's -- and -- and we know -- we know what that would look like, right? So, intends to pull us back, including back to a time before workers had the freedom to organize.
As president, we will always remember Donald Trump blocked overtime benefits for millions of workers --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- Tyrese talked a bit about this -- and opposed efforts to raise the minimum wage. He appointed union busters to the National Labor Relations Board.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he supported so-called right-to-work laws. And if --
AUDIENCE: Trump is a scab! Trump is a scab! Trump is a scab!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, -- well, here's the thing. Here's the thing. We have a choice here, right? And -- and we're not going back, because we also know that if Donald Trump were reelected, he intends to give tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He wants to impose what in effect is a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities that will cost -- and economists have said this -- that will cost a typical American family almost $4,000 a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and take us back to a time in our country which most of us remember, when insurance companies, you remember, had the power to deny people coverage based on a preexisting condition. Remember that?
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Deny people -- children who had asthma, a survivor of breast cancer, a grandparent with diabetes.
Look, America has tried those failed policies before. And they are failed policies. And we are not going back. (Applause.) We are not going back. We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And instead -- and instead, we fight for a future -- a future where no person has to go broke just because they got sick.
And so, when I am president, we will continue to strengthen the Affordable Care Act. We will bring down the cost of prescription drugs not only for some but for all Americans. (Applause.)
We -- we fight for a future where every worker has the freedom to organize. (Applause.) And so, when I am president, we will pass the PRO Act and end union busting once and for all. (Applause.)
And I'll remind everybody, on all these bills, we got to elect a Congress who supports that -- (applause) -- to be able to actually get that work done.
We fight for a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead. And so, when I am president, we will continue to build what I call an ""opportunity economy"" so that every American has an opportunity to own a home, to start a business, to build intergenerational wealth for their family.
We fight for a future where every senior can retire with dignity. And so, when I am president, we will continue to defend Social Security, Medicare, and pensions, just like we have done. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Sixty-four days -- 64 days -- the most important election of our lives and probably one of the most important in the life of our nation.
And here's what I'd say to all the brothers and sisters assembled: We know this is going to be a very tight race to the very end. We know -- we know --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I got your back. But I'm telling you, we know how they play. We know what they do.
So, let's not pay too much attention to the polls. Let's know, like labor always does: We are out here running like we are the underdog in this race, because we know what we are fighting for. (Applause.) We know what we stand for, and that's why we know what we fight for. (Applause.)
And we got some hard work ahead of us. But, again, we all like hard work, because hard work is good work. And to do that hard work, I'm going to count on everyone here, all the leaders here, for your work, for your organizing, knocking on doors, and getting folks to the polls.
Because, put bluntly, Michigan, y'all know how to win. (Applause.) You know how to win. You know how to win.
So, today, I ask: Detroit, Michigan, are you ready to have your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight --
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win.
God bless you. (Applause.)

    Remarks at a Campaign Event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
  


  

  
    September 02, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, Pittsburgh! (Applause.)
Thank you, Joe! (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It is good to be in the house of labor. (Applause.) It is good to be in the house of labor. And it is good to be back at IBEW Local 5. (Applause.)
And can we please give it up again for our president, Joe Biden? (Applause.)
Now, I don't have to tell the brothers and sisters of labor that you really get to know somebody when you're in the middle of a fight, when times are hard, when the forces are mighty, when people don't believe something can get done, and they have a thousand excuses for why it can't get done.
And I have spent more time with this extraordinary human being when the cameras were not in the room, when the stakes were high, when the heat was intense. And Joe Biden has always stood with the workers of America and labor unions of America. (Applause.) Always. Always.
I've been with him when he'll bring folks into the Oval Office. And you know how Joe can get sometimes. He doesn't spare words. It's good that sometimes the cameras are not in the room when he has those conversations. (Laughter.)
Because the thing about the Joe Biden I know -- and I know you know, because he has been a frain- -- friend of labor for so long, for his whole life -- Joe Biden can be quite impatient, and that's a good thing for that kind of leader. (Laughter.) Quite impatient.
And I say to all of the friends here, the press that's in the room: History will show what we here know. (Applause.) Joe Biden has been one of the most transformative presidents in the United States that we have ever witnessed. (Applause.) And it comes from his heart. (Applause.)
And, you know, Joe and I talk a lot about the fact that we are so proud to be the most pro-union administration in America's history, and it's thanks to your leadership. (Applause.)
And, as we know, Joe has still got a lot of work to do, so let's -- let's also understand that.
So, I want to thank all the incredible leaders who are here today, including the governor, Shapiro; Lieutenant Governor Davis; Senator Casey, who we will reelect this November -- (applause); Mayor Gainey; President Shuler; President Cooper; all the leaders of labor who are here; all the union members who are here.
So, I'll just get right to a few points. I love Labor Day. (Laughter.) I love celebrating Labor Day. And Pittsburgh, of course, is a cradle of the American labor movement. (Applause.) It is the birthplace of the AFL, headquarters of the Steelworkers, home to Fire Fighters Local 1, and, of course, the historic IBEW Local 5. (Applause.)
For more than 150 years, the brothers and sisters of labor have helped lead the fight for fair pay, better benefits, and safe working conditions, and every person in our nation has benefited from that work.
You know, everywhere I go, I tell people, ""You may not be a union member, but you better thank unions for that five-day work week. Thank unions for sick leave. Thank unions for paid family leave. Thank unions for your vacation time."" (Applause.)
Because when union wages go up, everybody's wages go up. When union workplaces are safer, all workplaces are safer. When unions are strong, America is strong. (Applause.)
And we are clear: Not only has Pittsburgh shaped the history of America's labor movement, today you are also shaping its future. (Applause.)
In 2021, with my dear friend, the Secretary, Marty Walsh, who the president appointed to be Secretary of Labor, he and I hosted a meeting right here in this Local, and it was part of the White House Labor Task Force that I lead.
That day, we met with a group of computer programmers who were working to form a union. One month later, they signed their contract and became the first -- one of the first technology unions in our nation -- (applause) -- standing on the shoulder of all those who have been here and fought the good fight.
So, Pittsburgh, I r- -- I remind us of that to say, together, we are fighting to build an economy that works for all working people. (Applause.) And that has always been the vision of the labor movement. And that is the vision of our campaign. (Applause.)
You know, in this election, there are two very different visions for our nation: one, ours, focused on the future; the other focused on the past.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We fight for the future. (Applause.) We fight for a future of dignity, respect, and opportunity for all people. (Applause.)
We fight knowing it's some backward thinking for those folks to have been suggesting for years that the -- the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down. You know, that's the stuff they're pushing -- that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down -- when we know the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up -- (applause) -- who you lift up.
Do you fight for workers? Do you fight for families? Do you fight for those who must be seen and heard and deserve the dignity that comes with hard work? (Applause.)
That's what we fight for. And when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. (Applause.)
So, we're 64 days out from this election. (Laughter.) Ballots in Pennsylvania will start dropping in 14 days -- (applause) -- 14 days. And this election is, as much as anything else, a fight for the promise of America -- (applause) -- for the promise of America.
We love our country. (Applause.) We love our country. And we know it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country, and that's what this election is about, and about the promise of America.
And I don't need to tell unions what the promise looks like. It's what you do every day. (Applause.)
But as we fight to move forward, Donald Trump is trying to pull us backward, including back to a time before workers had the freedom to organize.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: He's going to jail!
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, the courts will handle that, and we will handle November. How about that? (Laughter and applause.) We'll handle November. Let the courts handle that other thing. But we're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. And --
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And one of the ways -- one of the ways we're going to guarantee we don't go back is that we remember. Right? It is important to remember what that was and what it is.
Remember, as president, Donald Trump blocked overtime benefits for millions of workers.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He opposed efforts to raise the minimum wage. As the president said, he appointed union busters to the National Labor Relations Board.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And don't forget, he supported so-called right-to-work laws.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And if Donald Trump were to be reelected, he intends to give more tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He wants to impose what, in effect, would be a national sales tax. I call it the ""Trump national sales tax"" on everyday products and basic necessities that would cost a typical American family -- the economists have said this -- almost $4,000 a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to repeal the Affordable Care Act
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and take us back to what we remember -- because it wasn't that long ago -- was a time when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was? Children with asthma. Breast cancer survivors. Grandparents with diabetes.
Well, look, America has tried those failed policies before, and we are not going back. (Applause.) We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And instead -- and instead, we fight for a future where no person has to go broke just because they get sick. (Applause.)
And so, building on the work of President Joe Biden and I and the work we have done in the White House, we will continue to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and make prescription drugs affordable for all Americans.
We -- (applause) -- we -- we fight for a future where every worker has the freedom to organize. And we will pass the PRO Act and end union busting once and for all, and Bob Casey will help us do that. (Applause.)
We -- we see and know and fight for a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead. (Applause.)
And so, we will continue to build what I call an ""opportunity economy"" so that every American has an opportunity to buy a home or start a business or build intergenerational wealth and have a future that matches their dreams and ambitions and aspirations. (Applause.)
Because, of course, that's the nature of who we are as Americans. We have dreams. We can see what is possible, unburdened by what has been. We have aspirations. We have ambitions. And the system that is a good system is one that supports that and allows people the opportunity to go where they can see and imagine themselves to be.
That's what I'm talking about when I talk about an opportunity economy.
We fight for a future where every senior can retire with dignity, and so we will continue to defend Social Security and Medicare and pensions. (Applause.) And pensions. And pensions. (Applause.)
And we will continue to strengthen America's manufacturing sector.
And on that point, the president mentioned it, U.S. Steel is an historic American company, and it is vital for our nation to maintain strong American steel companies. And I couldn't agree more with President Biden, U.S. Steel should remain American-owned and American-operated. (Applause.)
And I will always have the back of America's steelworkers -- (applause) -- and all of America's workers.
So, friends, 64 days until the most [important] election of our lives, and probably one of the most important in the life of our nation, truly.
And we know this is going to be a tight race to the very end. It's going to be a tight race to the very end. So, let's not pay too much attention to those polls. Because as unions and labor knows best, we know what it's like to be the underdog. And we are the underdog in this race, and we have some hard work, then, ahead of us.
But here's the beauty of us in this room: We like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. (Applause.)
And so, in this fight, I will continue to count on the strength, the determination, and the hard work of the leaders in this room to knock on doors, to get folks to the polls, and -- bluntly put, because the people in here do it -- to help us win Pennsylvania. (Applause.)
So, today, I ask, are you ready to make your voices heard?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in freedom?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in opportunity?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in the promise of America?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And are we ready to fight for it?
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And when we fight --
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win.
God bless you. God bless America. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in North Hampton, New Hampshire
  


  

  
    September 04, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi, everyone. Hi. (Applause.)
Good afternoon, North Hampton! (Laughs.) (Applause.) Oh, my goodness.
Can we hear it for Nicole and Throwback Brewery? (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) Hi, guy- -- thank you. Thank you, thank you. Wow. (Applause.) Thank you, all. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
It's so good to be back in New Hampshire. Thank you all. (Applause.) Thank you.
And Doug sends his love to everyone as well. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
Oh, thank you, everyone. Nicole, thank you. You guys are just so extraordinary, and I applaud the way you do the business that you do and the love that you do in giving community. I love our small-business owners. It is what you do -- I'm going to talk a bit about you in a minute, but you are part of the fabric -- the essential fabric of a community that cares about one another.
Thank you for everything. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you.
And thank you to the outstanding congressional delegation: Senators Shaheen, Hassan -- (applause); Representatives Pappas and Kuster -- (applause); and all the leaders who are here today. Thank you all. Thank you all for -- for taking the time to be here this afternoon. Thank you, everyone. (Applause.)
Thank you.
So, before I begin, I do want to say a few words about this tragic shooting that took place this morning in Winder, Georgia. We're still gathering information about what happened, but we know that there were multiple fatalities and injuries. And, you know, our hearts are with all the students, the teachers, and their families, of course, and we are grateful to the first responders and the law enforcement that were on the scene.
But this is just a senseless tragedy on top of so many senseless tragedies. And it's just outrageous that every day in our country, in the United States of America, that parents have to send their children to school worried about whether or not their child will come home alive. It's senseless. It -- it is -- we've got to stop it. (Applause.)
And we have to end this epidemic of gun violence in our country once and for all. You know, it doesn't have to be this way. It doesn't have to be this way.
So, we will continue, of course, to -- to send our prayers and our thoughts to the families and all those who were affected, including, you know -- I -- I'm going off script right now, but, listen. I mean, you know, at -- at the -- last year, at -- I -- I started a college tour, and I -- I traveled our country, meeting with our young leaders, right? And so, it was college-aged young leaders. So, I did trade schools, colleges, universities, community colleges.
By the way, I love Gen Z. I just love Gen Z. (Laughter.) (Applause.) Right?
But I'll tell you one of the things -- one of the things that I asked every time I went to the auditorium -- and it would be filled with these young leaders, students -- and I'd ask them, ""Raise your hand if at any point between kindergarten and 12th grade you had to endure an active shooter drill."" And the -- for the -- for the young leaders who are here who are raising their hand, I'm telling you, every time, the auditorium was packed, and almost every hand went up.
You know, a lot of us -- I'll tal- -- I'll speak about myself. You know, we had -- well, I grew up in California -- earthquake drills; we had fire drills. But our kids are sitting in a classroom where they should be fulfilling their God-given potential, and some part of their big, beautiful brain is concerned about a shooter busting through the door of the classroom.
It does not have to be this way. (Applause.) It does not have to be this way. And, you know, this is one of the many issues that's at stake in this election.
So, New Hampshire, look, we have 62 days to go -- (applause) -- 62 days to go. And I'm going to tell you what you already know: This race is going to be tight until the very end.
So, please, let's not pay too much attention to the polls, because we are running as the underdog. We know what they're capable of on the other side. The only thing we can take for granted is the love that we as Americans have for each other, knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us. (Applause.)
And we've got some hard work ahead, but we like hard work. Hard work is good work. (Applause.) Hard work can be joyful work. And so, we are up for the task. And with your help, we will win in November. (Applause.) We will win in November.
And that, in large part, is because we know what we stand for, and when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. (Applause.)
We love our country, and we believe in the promise of America. That's so much of what I think brings us all together this afternoon. We believe in the promise of America, and that includes a topic we're going to discuss today, which is what I call an ""opportunity economy"" -- building an opportunity economy. (Applause.)
And my vision of an opportunity economy is one where everyone can compete and have a real chance to succeed; where everyone, regardless of who they are or where they start, can build wealth, including intergenerational wealth; where workers are treated with dignity, and everyone has the freedom to join a union if they choose -- (applause); where we remove barriers to opportunity, so anyone who wants to start a business can have access to the tools and the resources they need to do that.
I believe -- and I said it before to Nicole -- I believe America's small businesses are an essential foundation to our entire economy. Think about it. (Applause.) Think about it. Small businesses in our country employ half of all private-sector workers. Half of all private-sector workers own or run a small business or work for a small business. They do trillions of dollars of business every year. They generate revenue that helps repair our roads and pay our teachers.
And, you know -- (applause) -- for all of those who are or know of small-business owners, the thing I love about you is that you're not only leaders in business, you are civic leaders, you are community leaders, you are mentors, you hire locally, you believe in the community, and you're part of the glue of the fabric that holds communities together.
You provide the local meeting space. You are the types of folks where you know who your regulars are, and when someone is walking in the door and you can tell they've had a bad day, you know exactly what they need. Isn't that the best of who we are? (Applause.) Isn't that the best of who we are?
And I've met so many entrepreneurs across the country who take the incredible leap of faith that is required to start a small business -- folks who put their life's savings on the line and work through the weekends and holidays because they aren't just building a business, they're pursuing a dream. They're building a better future for their employees and for the people they love and their communities. And by extension, they're building a stronger middle class and a stronger America for us all. (Applause.)
And so, all of this is why, as president, one of my highest priorities will be to strengthen America's small businesses. (Applause.) And here I am in New Hampshire to announce a few elements of my plan to do that. (Applause.)
So, first, we're going to help more small businesses and innovators get off the ground. Okay? (Applause.) Now I'm setting what some, I'm sure, are going to call a very ambitious goal. But you know what? I think we should admire ambition in each other. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
So, I want to see 25 million new small-business applications by the end of my first term. (Applause.) And to help achieve this, we will lower the cost of starting a new business.
So, here's the thing, on average, it costs about $40,000 to start a new business in America. That is a great financial barrier for a lot of folks, and it can hold entrepreneurs back. And the current tax deduction for a start-up is just $5,000. Okay? So, then you got to make up the delta there; you got to figure out how you're going to do that. Not everyone has access to that kind of wealth and capital.
So, part of my plan is we will expand the tax deduction for start-ups to $50,000. (Applause.) It's essentially a tax cut for starting a small business.
Second, my plan will help existing small businesses grow. We will provide low- and no-interest loans to small businesses that want to expand, and we will -- and this is very important -- cut the red tape that can make starting and growing a small business more difficult than it needs to be -- more difficult than it needs to be. (Applause.)
For example, we will make it cheaper and easier for small businesses to file their taxes, similar -- (applause) -- similar to how individuals can take a standard deduction. You know, I said to my team, kind of like -- now, I'm going to date myself again, because they no longer do it -- but kind of like -- you remember the 1040EZ? Like, that kind of idea, right? Like, let's just take away some of the bureaucracy in the process to make it easier for people to actually do something that's going to benefit our entire economy.
Third -- (applause) -- third, my plan will invest in small businesses and innovators throughout America, and here's why. We know that talent exists everywhere in our country, from rural towns to city centers. But not everyone has access to the financing, to venture capital, or expert advice. It's not that they don't have the skills, it's not that they don't have the work ethic; it's access to these resources.
So, under my plan, we will expand access to venture capital. We will support innovation hubs and business incubators. (Applause.) And we will increase federal contracts with small businesses. (Applause.) And we will have a particular focus on small businesses in rural communities, like right here in New Hampshire. (Applause.)
Finally, my plan will make our tax code more fair, while also prioritizing investment and innovation.
So, let us be clear: Billionaires and big corporations must pay their fair share in taxes. (Applause.) Because here is the thing -- here is the thing. It's just not right that those who can most afford it are often paying a lower tax rate than our teachers and our nurses and our firefighters. (Applause.) It's just not right. It's just not right.
So, that's why I support a billionaire minimum tax and corporations paying their fair share. (Applause.) And while we ensure that the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share, we will tax capital gains at a rate that rewards investment in America's innovators, founders, and small businesses. (Applause.)
So, here's the detail. If you earn a million dollars a year or more, the tax rate on your long-term capital gains will be 28 percent under my plan, because we know when the government encourages investment, it leads to broad-based economic growth and it creates jobs, which makes our economy stronger. (Applause.)
Now compare that to what Donald Trump plans.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to cut off federal programs that give loans to small businesses.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He plans to give billionaires massive tax cuts and to cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars, even as they pull in record profits.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: His plans will add more than $5 trillion to the national debt, and that is on top of the $2 trillion tax cut he gave them when he was president and when he exploded the deficit.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We know how to count. (Laughter.) We know how to count.
And now he also wants to impose what, in effect, is a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities, which will skyrocket the cost for families and small businesses.
And, New Hampshire, on top of all of this, if Donald Trump were to win in November, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- which would significantly increase costs on small businesses, as we know --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Lock him up!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and -- well, you know what? The courts are going to handle that, and we will handle November. How about that? (Applause.) How about that? (Laughs.)
That's how we'll handle that. How about that? (Applause.)
But think about it. He wants to end the Affordable Care Act, taking us back to a time when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was? Children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes.
So, yeah, look, we are here to tell him and them: We are not going back. (Applause.) We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: No, we are not, and we will move forward, because ours is a fight for the future. (Applause.) And -- and it is a fight for freedom. (Applause.) And it is a fight for freedom.
Now, I don't have to tell the folks of New Hampshire, the ""Live Free or Die"" state. (Applause.) You know the importance of individual freedoms, fundamental freedoms. You know how hard people fought for these freedoms and that they are foundational to who we are and what we stand for as America, including the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. (Applause.)
And understand how we got here. Understand how we got here. And, of course, we're not going to fall for the gaslighting he's pushing, right?
AUDIENCE: No!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: When he was president, Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And as he intended, they did. And now, in more than 20 states in our nation, there is a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral -- immoral.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And let us agree, and I know we do: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body. (Applause.)
And if he wins -- and if he wins, you can be sure Donald Trump will go further, and he will sign a national abortion ban. And -- and you know Project 2025, which I just --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I mean, can you believe they put that thing in writing? (Laughter.)
And under Project 2025, he would create a national antiabortion coordinator, which would force states -- I mean, this is unbelievable, right? -- which would force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You know what they are making really quite clear? They just don't trust women. They just don't trust women.
But we trust women. (Applause.) We trust women.
And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.)
Across our nation --
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) (Inaudible.)
Across our nation -- across our nation -- and I've been traveling for many, many mo- -- well, years, actually, and certainly months, most recently. Across our nation, I'm telling you, we are witnessing a full-on attack on hard-fought, hard-won fundamental freedoms and rights, including the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence --
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water --
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.)
And so, here's what I don't have to tell the folks of New Hampshire, because you know it so well, it's part of your DNA. Generations of Americans before us, they fought for freedom and they led the fight for freedom in our country. And now the baton is in our hands. The baton is in our hands.
So, let us understand, which we do, our purpose at this very moment. Let us remember the broad shoulders upon which we stand and the traditions of this very fight that have led to what we have been able to accomplish.
And let us understand, then, that when we say ""fight,"" it is a fight for something, not against something. It is for something. (Applause.) That's what we're talking about when we talk about a new way forward. This is for something.
And so, as an example, let us finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. (Applause.) Let us finally pass an assault weapons ban and universal background checks and red flag laws -- (applause) -- because we are clear, on that point, it is a false choice to say you're either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone's guns away. I'm in favor of the Second Amendment, and I know we need reasonable gun safety laws in our country. (Applause.)
And there's another point that I'd like to stress about this election in '24. This is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher this time for a number of reasons, but I'm going to mention one, in particular: what the Supreme Court recently did when they basically just told the former president that, going forward, he will effectively be immune, no matter what he does in the White House.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But let's take this seriously and understand what it means. Before, at least, there might have been the threat that there would be consequence and accountability. With that ruling, what this means is that almost explicitly, he has been told no consequence.
And imagine -- just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Just imagine with no guardrails.
He has openly vowed to be a dictator on day one. He has said he would end the independence of the Department of Justice -- the United States Department of Justice --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- so he could have the unchecked power to seek vengeance against people who disagree with him.
He even called for -- I'm going to quote now -- the ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States of America.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Let us be very clear: Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States of America should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. (Applause.) Never again.
So, I'll end where I started. When it comes down to it, we are all here together because we love our country. We love our country, and we know the privilege -- the privilege and pride that comes with being an American.
And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. That is how we realize the promise of America. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And so, with that being said, I ask: New Hampshire, are you ready to have your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight --
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win!
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. God bless you. (Applause.)

    September 10, 2024  

  
    VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Hey, Philly! (Laughs.) (Applause.)
All right, so you guys know how I am. Okay. Today was a good day. We got to work tomorrow. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
We got 56 days to go. We got a lot of work to do. And let me just say that I think we all know that tonight was a night that highlights something that you all have been working so hard on. We have folks here who have been knocking on doors. Well, you know. (Applause.)
We -- but we have a lot of work to do. Okay? And tonight, I think, highlighted for the American people what's at stake. I started the debate by talking about it and it became apparent, I think, throughout those -- that about an hour and a half that -- (laughter) -- look, this is very much two different vision for our country: ours, which is a vision for the future, and his, which is about the past and taking us backward. And as I said on the debate stage, we are not going back. (Applause.)
We are not going back. And so, we know what we're fighting for. We know what we stand for. And that's why we know what we're fighting for. We're fighting for the dignity of all people. We're fighting for the dignity of work. We are fighting for middle-class families. We are fighting to uplift people, understanding the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down, it's based on who you lift up. (Applause.)
That's what we stand for.
And so, we've got some work to do because -- listen, I -- I think that we think today was a good day, and it kind of was. (Applause.) But we have 56 days to go. And, guys, we're still the underdogs in this race. It's tight.
We have got to win Pennsylvania. (Applause.) And we are going to Pennsylvania. (Applause.)
And it is because of you. It is because of you, who have signed up, who have volunteered. You are organizing. You're helping us to email and text and knock on doors and talk to your neighbors and your friends.
And here's the thing about the spirit of our campaign. It is people driven. It is about the people. It is about uplifting our country.
This is a campaign born out of love of country. We love our country. (Applause.) We believe in who we are. We believe in the American people.
This is a campaign about bringing folks together, knowing the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. (Applause.)
It is about inclusion, and it is not about division. And it is not about demeaning and name-calling. It is about lifting folks up -- working folks, families, children, people who are just -- not just trying to get by, but trying to get ahead. That's what we stand for. (Applause.)
So, let's get out here for these next 56 days. Hard work is good work. (Applause.) And we will win. We will win. (Applause.)
See you later. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Greensboro, North Carolina
  


  

  
    September 12, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good evening, North Carolina! (Applause.) Good evening, Greensboro! (Applause.) Good evening. (Applause.)
Yeah, we're doing this. Yes, we're doing this. (Applause.) We are doing this. (Applause.)
Good evening. Oh, it's good to be back in Greensboro. Can we hear it for Jazmin, please? (Applause.) I'll tell you, when I hear our young leaders such as Jazmin, I know the future of our country is so bright -- so bright -- so bright. (Applause.)
And it is so good to be back in Greensboro and to be with so many leaders. (Applause.) Thank you, everybody. Thank you.
I want to thank the incredible governor, Roy Cooper. (Applause.) Thank you. Your next governor, Attorney General Josh Stein -- (applause); Representative Manning -- (applause); Mayor Vaughan -- (applause); the Council of State candidates -- (applause); and all the leaders with us today.
So, North Carolina, two nights ago, Donald Trump and I had our debate. (Applause.) You watched it? Did you watch it? (Laughs.)
And look, I believe we owe it to have another debate, right? (Applause.) We owe it to the voters. Because here's the thing, in this election, what's at stake could not be more important.
On Tuesday night, I talked about issues that I know matter to the families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in America's small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom -- (applause) -- and keeping our nation safe and secure. (Applause.)
But that's not what we heard from Donald Trump. Instead -- you know, and I called it at the beginning of the debate: It was the same old show -- same old, tired playbook we've heard for years, with no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people.
Well, folks, look, it's time to turn the page. (Applause.) Turn the page. I see you. (Laughs.)
America is ready for a new way forward, and we are ready for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic -- optimistic about what we can do for our country together. (Applause.)
And that is why Democrats, Republicans, and independents are all supporting our campaign, because we agree -- we agree we have a duty as citizens to put country above partisanship and defend our Constitution -- and defend our Constitution.
And that is my pledge to you: I will always put country above party. From the courthouse to the White House, I have always fought for the people. (Applause.) Always fought for the people.
From being a young courtroom prosecutor --
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes, USA. Go on. (Applause.)
From being a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, California, I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them. (Applause.)
As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks and delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure. (Applause.)
I stood up for veterans being sued -- being scammed by big for-profit colleges; for workers who were being cheated out of their wages -- the wages they were due; for seniors facing elder abuse.
I will be a president for all Americans. (Applause.) And together -- together, we will build a brighter future for our nation. Together.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we're -- all right, Nupe. (Laughs.)
We are going to build a future where we build what I call an ""opportunity economy"" so every American has an opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business. (Applause.)
And let me tell you, I love our small businesses. Are there small business leaders here? Raise your hand. (Applause.) That's right. That's right.
So, you know, growing up -- growing up, my mother, she worked long hours. She often worked very long hours, my mother. And so, my sister Maya and I would go over to Ms. Shelton's house.
Now, Ms. Shelton, we called her our second mother. She was the second mother to us. She actually was from Louisiana, and she would take care of us in the evenings and on the weekends when my mother was working. And she was a small-business owner.
And let me tell you what I learned from being a young child about a small-business owner, Ms. Shelton. Our small-business owners, you are business leaders and you are civic leaders. You are community leaders. (Applause.) You hire locally. You mentor. You are part of the fabric of our communities.
And you, like Ms. Shelton, are the backbone of America's economy -- (applause) -- the backbone.
So, I have a plan for you, and my plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction for start-up businesses. (Applause.) Because I understand not everybody, like the person that was on the stage with me the other night, gets handed $400 million on a silver platter and then files for bankruptcy six times. (Applause.) Come on. Come on.
I know what -- because, look, my mother, she worked hard, she saved up, and it wasn't until I was a teenager she was able to buy our first home. I know the challenges that Americans and working people and families are having right now in terms of affordable housing. And we need to build more housing in America. (Applause.)
So, part of my plan -- part of my vision for an opportunity economy is we are going to cut red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term. (Applause.)
And I have a plan to lower the cost of living for America's families on everything from health care to groceries, including taking on price gouging -- (applause) -- and those corporations when they take advantage of people in need.
Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut. (Applause.) Thousands of dollars of your hard-earned money will go back in your pockets, including $6,000 during the first year of a child's life -- (applause) -- for young parents, knowing in that critical stage of your child's development, you might need a little help, not just to get by but to get ahead. (Applause.)
And I will always put the middle class and working families first. I know where I came from. (Applause.) I know where I came from. I'm clear about that.
Now, Donald Trump -- well, he has a different plan. Just google ""Project 2025.""
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I see you have. (Laughs.)
It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president. Donald Trump will give billionaires massive cuts -- massive tax cuts and cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- even as they pull down record profits.
He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he wants to impose what I call a ""Trump sales tax"" on everyday basic necessities, which will cost the average American family nearly $4,000 a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Some of the top economists in our country and in the world have reviewed these plans. Goldman Sachs, for example, has said that my plan would grow our economy and his plan would shrink the economy -- (applause) -- that his plan would reignite inflation and send us into a recession by the middle of next year.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: On top of this -- on top of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Now, think about that. Think about that. Think -- we remember what it meant when insurance companies could deny you for a preexisting condition. Remember what that was?
So, he wants to get rid of it. And as he said in the debate, he made clear he has no plan to replace it. In fact -- you remember? ""Concept."" (Laughter.) Do you remember? He has, quote, ""concepts of a plan."" Concepts of a plan.
I mean, we're 54 days from this election. ""Concepts of a plan,"" which means no actual plan -- (laughter) -- which means no actual plan.
And 45 million Americans are insured through the Affordable Care Act. So, understand what that means. He's going to end it based on a concept and take us back when folks were suffering.
Well, we're not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. (Applause.)
We're not going back. No, we're not going back.
No, we -- we, together, will move forward, because ours is a fight for the future. (Applause.) And -- and ours is a fight for freedom -- (applause) -- like the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
And we remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade -- with the intention they would undo the protections. And they did exactly as he intended. And now, more than 20 states have a Trump abortion ban, including North Carolina --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and every single state in the South except Virginia, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest. It is immoral -- immoral.
And I know everyone here understands. Let us agree: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body. (Applause.) Come on. Come on.
And when -- and when he was asked on Tuesday night, Donald Trump refused to say that he would veto a national abortion ban.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well -- well, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law -- (applause) -- proudly sign it into law. We are not playing around.
And across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on attack on hard- fought, hard-won fundamental rights and freedoms, like the freedom to vote; the freedom to be safe from gun violence -- (applause); the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water -- (applause); and the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.)
And here's the thing that I know about all of the North Carolinian leaders who are here. You know this so well as part of your DNA. Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Generations of Americans before us, many from right here --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Get a medic!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- led the fight for freedom. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Medic! Medic!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Let's get a medic. Let's get a medic.
Do we have a medic? Get -- no -- let's get a medic over there, please. Let's get a medic a- -- over there.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. But let's make sure -- see -- see, this is who we are. We look out for each other. That's what leaders do: looking out for each other. (Applause.)
Okay, we've got a medic. Okay.
So, generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom, and now the baton is in our hands. (Applause.) The baton is now in our hands.
And we who believe, then, in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. (Applause.)
And we who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban, universal background checks, and red flag laws. (Applause.)
So much is on the line in this election --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You got this, Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And -- we got this. (Applause.) We got this.
But look -- but look, here's the thing. This is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher, because two months ago, the United States Supreme Court basically told the former president that he will effectively be immune no matter what he does in the White House.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well -- well, here's the thing, the courts will take care of that. Let's take care of November. How about that? (Applause.) All right? (Laughs.)
But imagine -- imagine what that court ruling means. Imagine what that means. Because before, there might have been at least the -- the belief that there would be the threat of consequence, but now there's an explicit ruling from the court that suggests he would be immune.
Imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Imagine what that would look like. He who has vowed, if reelected, he will be a dictator on day one.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He who called for the, quote, ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States.
And let us be very clear: Someone who suggests that we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United
States. (Applause.) Never again. Never again. Never. (Applause.)
And put that all in the context of people who have been talking about how he was when they served with him in the White House, people who saw him every day -- his national security advisor, his defense secretary, his chief of staff, and his vice president -- all -- all of whom have warned America Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States -- (applause) -- and should never occupy our nation's highest office again.
So, North Carolina, I believe it all comes down to this. We are here together. We are here together because we love our country. We love our country. (Applause.) And we together understand the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth: the privilege and pride of being an American. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's an awesome responsibility.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. That's right. That's right.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I do believe -- I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. (Applause.)
And so, North Carolina, we have 54 days until Election Day -- (applause) -- 54 days until Election Day and just 35 days until early voting begins. (Applause.)
And it's not only the presidency that's on the ballot. There are many, many important races, like Josh Stein running for governor -- (applause) -- whose -- whose opponent -- whose opponent was handpicked by Donald Trump because he wants a total ban on abortion in this state.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And that is just one of the many stakes that are at play in this election.
But see, we know the power is with the people. The power is with the people. (Applause.) Your voice is your vote, North Carolina. (Applause.) And you are going to make all the difference in the outcome of this race.
And look, we know ours will be a very tight race until the very end. We are the underdog. Let's be clear about that. We are the underdog. And so, we have hard work ahead of us, but we like hard work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work.
And with your help, we will win. We will win. (Applause.)
And so, I ask you today, North Carolina, are you ready to make your voices heard?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in freedom?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in opportunity?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in the promise of America?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And are we ready to fight for it?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And when we fight --
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win. (Applause.) (Laughs.) There you go.
God bless you. And God bless America. (Applause.)

    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, North Carolina. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Good afternoon. (Laughs.) We're going to do this. (Applause.)
Good afternoon. Good afternoon. It is -- we- -- (applause).
Thank you.
Okay. All right. Okay. Okay. (Laughs.) We got some work to do. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
All right. Oh, my goodness. (Applause.)
Are we going to do this North Carolina? Yes. (Applause.)
It is so wonderful to be back in Charlotte. I want to thank you all. Can we give it up for Stacy for telling her incredible story? (Applause.)
And can we please thank that incredible Anthony Hamilton for his incredible performance? (Applause.) I love Anthony Hamilton.
And it is so good --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I love you back. I love you back. Thank you.
And we have so many outstanding leaders here today, including my friend, Governor Roy Cooper, and your next -- (applause) -- and your next governor, Attorney General Josh Stein. (Applause.)
And here with us is your next attorney general, Congressman Jeff Jackson. (Applause.)
Mayor Lyles, my dear friend; the Council of State candidates; and all the leaders who are with us today, I thank you all -- everyone -- everyone here for taking the time and doing the work you are doing.(Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)
All right. So, here's the thing. Okay. We got a lot of work to do. We got a lot of work to do.
Okay. So, North Carolina, you probably know -- and please have a seat, if you have a chair. (Laughs.)
Two nights ago, Donald Trump and I had our first debate. (Applause.) And I believe we owe it to the voters to have another debate -- (applause) -- because this election and what is at stake could not be more important.
On Tuesday night, I talked about issues that I know matter to families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in America's small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom -- (applause) -- and keeping -- and keeping our nation safe and secure.
But that's not what we heard from Donald Trump.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Instead, it was the same old show, that same tired playbook that we've heard for years, with no plans for how he would address the needs of the American people -- because you know it's all about him, it's not about you.
Well, folks, I said it then; I say it now: It's time to turn the page. (Applause.) Turn that page. Turn that page. B- --
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Turn the p- -- (laughs).
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Because, to your point -- to your point, America is ready for a new way forward. (Applause.) We are ready for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can do together.
That is why Democrats, Republicans, and independents are supporting our campaign. (Applause.) Over 200 people who worked for President George H.W. Bush, President George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney have endorsed me for president. (Applause.) Former Vice President Dick Cheney and Congresswoman Liz Cheney are supporting me as well. (Applause.) Because, as they said, we have a duty as citizens to put country above partisanship and defend our Constitution. (Applause.)
And that is my pledge to you. I will always put country above party, and I will be a president for all Americans. (Applause.)
And while Donald Trump is trying to pull our nation backward, we are fighting for the future -- (applause) -- a future with affordable childcare, paid leave, and affordable health care; a future where we build what I call an opportunity economy so every American has an opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business. (Applause.)
And, you know, I -- I talked about it the other night. I love our small businesses. I really do. I love our small businesses. My -- my -- and -- and they're -- many of whom are here. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
And -- and the thing about our small businesses is -- is they are -- you know, my -- so, first of all, my mother worked very hard. And -- and there was a lady who helped raise us, who was a second mother to us, Ms. Shelton, and she was a small business owner.
And I grew up, then, understanding who our small business owners are. They're -- they're the -- they're leaders in the community. They're civic leaders. They hire locally. They mentor. They're part of the fabric of the community. And -- and I know they are the backbone of America's economy. (Applause.)
So, my plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction to start up small businesses. (Applause.) Because, you know, not everybody started out with 40 -- $400 million on a silver platter and then filed for bankruptcy six times.
But a whole lot of people have the ingenuity, the entrepreneurship, the work ethic, and the ambition to do that kind of work and just need to be seen and supported for what they are and what they do for all of us.(Applause.) An opportunity economy.
We need to build more housing in America. (Applause.) And so, we are going to cut red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term. (Applause.)
I have a plan to lower the cost of living for America's families on everything from health care to groceries. Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a tax break, and thousands of dollars of your hard-earned money will go back into your pockets, including $6,000 during the first year of a child's life. (Applause.)
And I will always put middle-class and working families first. I grew up a middle-class kid. (Applause.) I was raised by a hardworking mother, who saved up, and by the time I was a teenager, she was able to afford to buy our first home. I understand how people work hard and have dreams and aspirations for their children and need to be put first, understanding, again, when the middle class is strong, America is strong. (Applause.) America is strong.
But Donald Trump, well, he has a different plan.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Just google -- just google ""Project 2025.""
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president.
Donald Trump will give billionaires and big corporations massive tax cuts and cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- even as they pull in record profits.
He will add more than $5 trillion to the national debt.
He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he wants to impose what is, in effect, a national sales tax. I call it a ""Trump sales tax,"" because it will be a tax on everyday basic necessities, which the economists have measured will cost the average family nearly $4,000 more a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And -- and the top economists, they've previewed our plans. They've reviewed them. Goldman Sachs says my plan would grow our economy and his plan would shrink it. (Applause.) Sixteen -- sixteen Nobel Prize-winning economists say he would reignite inflation, and Moody's says he would ignite a recession by the middle of next year.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You know, he talks a big talk, but when folks review the numbers -- highly respected folks -- that's what you learn about him. That's what you learn.
And North Carolina, on top of all of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And as Stacy mentioned, you heard what he said in the debate. He -- he has no plan to replace it. (Laughter.) He said -- (laughs) -- he said ""concepts of a plan."" (Laughs.)
Oh, you all watched the debate. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
""Concepts."" ""Concepts."" No actual plan. ""Concepts."" (Laughter.)
And understand what's at stake on that: 45 million Americans are insured through the Affordable Care Act, and he's going to end it based on a concept -- (laughter) -- and take us back to when insurance companies have the power to deny people with preexisting conditions.
Well, we are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) We're not going back. We're --
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. No.
We will move forward. We will move forward, because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom -- (applause) -- like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
And we know how we got to this issue, because Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended. And now in over 20 states in our nation, they have what I call ""Trump abortion bans,"" including North Carolina --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and every single state in the South except Virginia. Think about that: every single state in the south except Virginia.
Now one in three women in America lives under a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest. It is immoral. It is immoral.
And I know we all here understand and agree: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body. (Applause.)
And what we know is that the i- -- the impact of this is -- you know, it's been over two years now since that decision came down. The impact of this is so real. It's affecting people every day just based on the stories we know, and there are so many stories we don't know. Think about it.
Because of Trump's abortion bans, women are being refused care during miscarriages. Some are only being treated if they develop sepsis.
And when asked on Tuesday night, Donald Trump refused to say that he would veto a national abortion ban. You remember that? He refused to answer that question.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Refused to answer that question.
Well, I'mma tell you, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly, proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly.
And across our nation -- across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard
won fundamental freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, and the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.)
And North Carolina has a history of the point I'm about to make. Generations -- generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom, and now the baton is in our hands. It is in our hands. (Applause.)
So, we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. (Applause.) And we who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban, universal background checks, and red flag laws. (Applause.)
So much -- so much is at stake in this election. So much is at stake in this election. And understand this is not 2016 or 2020 for a number of reasons, including why the stakes are higher. Because two months ago, the United States Supreme Court basically told the former president that he will effectively be immune no matter what he does in the White House.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Think about that. Think about that. Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right? He -- he who has vowed that if reelected, he will be a dictator on day one; that he will weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies; and has called for the, quote, ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States of America.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Think about that. And let us be very clear: Somebody who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. (Applause.) Never again. Never again. Never again.
And you know one of the points that I mentioned on Tuesday -- so, let -- the people who served under him at the White House, who saw him every day -- right? -- his national security advisor, his Defense secretary, his chief of staff, and his vice president all have warned -- all, who worked with him every day in the White House, sat with him in the Oval Office -- have warned America Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States and should never again occupy our nation's highest office. (Applause.)
So, North --
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. So -- so, it comes down to this. It comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country. And we understand the awesome -- the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth: the privilege and pride of being an American. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. That's right.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. That's right. Right.
And so, I believe it is the highest form, then, of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. (Applause.)
So, North Carolina, we have 54 days until Election Day -- (applause) -- 54 days -- and just 35 days -- just 35 days until early voting begins. (Applause.)
And it's not only the presidency that's on the ballot. There are many important races, including Josh Stein running for governor -- (applause) -- that's right -- whose opponent was handpicked by Donald Trump and wants a ban -- a total ban on abortion in this state.
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right.
So, these are the stakes in this election, up and down the ballot -- up and down the ballot. But we know the power is with the people. (Applause.) The power is with the people. And your voice is your vote, North Carolina. (Applause.) Your vote is your voice.
And we know -- here's the thing, also. We're all -- we've got -- we are just -- we are loving our campaign, aren't we? We are loving this campaign. (Applause.) We're having a good time. We're having a good time. I know that.
But here's also the thing. Ours will be a very tight race until the end. Okay? It's going to be a tight race until the end, and we are the underdog. Understand that. We are the underdog.
There are powerful forces trying to convince people that their vote doesn't matter.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: We love you!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: There are powerful forces here too. (Laughs.)
But I say all that to say we've got some hard work ahead of us. But here's the thing I love about everybody here: We love hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. (Applause.)
And with your help, we will win in November. We will win. We will. (Applause.) We will win.
So, North Carolina, today, I then ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in opportunity?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in the promise of America?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And are we ready to fight for it?
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And when we fight --
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win.
God Bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania
  


  

  
    September 13, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good evening, Pennsylvania. (Applause.) Good evening.
Can we please hear it for Mary-Grace? (Applause.)
It's good to be back in Pennsylvania. Hi, everyone. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Okay. Okay. We got some business to handle. Okay. (Applause.) (Laughs.)
So, let me start by saying to everyone here, thank you for all you are doing and for taking the time to be here this evening.
You know, one of the things that I love about everyone who is here and what we are doing: You know, in the midst of this moment where there are people trying to divide us as a nation, trying to make people feel small and feel alone, these are moments that remind all of us that we are all in this together as one loving community. (Applause.) We're all in this together. We're all in this together.
So, thank you all for the time you've taken to be here this evening.
I want to thank also all the incredible leaders, including Governor Shapiro, who you heard from earlier — (applause); Senator Bob Casey, who we will reelect to the United States Senate — (applause); and Mayor Brown. And thank you, Mayor, for the warm welcome. (Applause.)
All right. So, Pennsylvania, three days ago, Donald Trump and I had our debate. (Applause.) (Laughs.) You watched it? (Laughs.)
So — yeah. So, here's the thing. So, I — I take it many people here watched it. So — (applause). (Laughs.) So, you'll remember, that night I talked about issues that matter to families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in America's small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom — (applause) — and keeping our nation safe and secure. (Applause.)
But that is not what we heard from Donald Trump.
AUDIENCE: Noo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Instead, it was the same old show, the same tired playbook we've heard for years with no plan — no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people.
Well, folks, it's time to turn the page. (Applause.) Let's turn the page.
We're not going back. We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And —
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we are not going back because —
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back because America is ready for a new way forward. (Applause.) We are ready for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can do together, which is why — and, Mary-Grace, thank you — which is why Democrats, Republicans, and independents are supporting our campaign. (Applause.)
We need a president of the United States who works for all the American people — (applause) — and that just stops with all the trying to divide us. Like, people are exhausted with that stuff. (Applause.) Exhausted.
And, you know, my entire career, I have fought for the people. As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them. (Applause.) As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks and delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure. (Applause.) I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for-profit colleges — (applause); for workers who were being cheated out of the wages they were due — (applause); for seniors facing elder abuse.
And as attorney general of a border state, I took on transnational criminal organizations, like the Sinaloa Cartel, that traffic in drugs and threaten the safety of our communities. (Applause.) I know these cartels firsthand, and as president, I will make sure we prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law — (applause) — for pushing poison like fentanyl on our children. (Applause.)
And as president, I will fight on behalf of all communities and all Americans. And together, we will build a brighter future for our nation. (Applause.) Together. Together.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And that future — and that future we build will include what I call an ""opportunity economy"" so that every American has an opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, and to start a business.
You know, I love our small businesses. So, growing up — (applause) — I really — do we have small-business leaders here? Raise your hand. (Applause.) Yeah. Right? Right?
So, growing up, my sister and my mother — my sister and me had a mother — have a mother — had a mother — excuse me; she passed. But our mother worked long hours. She worked hard; she worked long hours. And my sister, Maya, and I would go over to Ms. Shelton's house. Ms. Shelton lived a couple of doors down, and she helped my mother take care of us. And we, in fact, used to call her our second mother.
Well, Ms. Shelton was a small-business owner. And I will tell you, since I was a child, I know the character and the — the person who is a small-business owner. You're not only business leaders; you're civic leaders. You hold the community together. You're part of the fabric of the community. And small-business owners are the backbone of America's economy. (Applause.) The backbone of America's economy.
Which is why part of my plan that you heard about the other night will give a $50,000 tax deduction to start up small businesses — (applause) — knowing that not everybody, like my opponent, got handed $40 million on a silver tray and then filed for bankruptcy six times — (applause) — and people sometimes just need the opportunity, because we, as Americans, do not lack for ambition, for aspiration, for dreams, for the preparedness to do hard work, but not everyone has the opportunity, because not everyone has the access.
When I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is grounded in that foundational belief that when given an opportunity, people excel every day — (applause) — every day.
Part of my focus is on the fact that we need to build more housing in America. (Applause.) And so, we are going to cut red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term. (Applause.) And I have a plan to help lower the cost of living for America's families on everything from health care to groceries, including I will take on corporate price gouging — (applause) — which, as we know, is about those few bad guys taking advantage of desperate people. And there needs to be a consequence.
Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut, including — including expanding the Child Tax Credit — (applause) — to $6,000 during the first year of a child's life, understanding that new parents need support in that most critical phase of their child's development to help them — (applause) — buy a car seat, a crib, baby clothes.
I will also make sure good-paying jobs are available to all Americans, not just those with college degrees. (Applause.) For far too long, our nation has encouraged only one path to success: a four-year college degree. Our nation needs to recognize the value of other paths — additional paths, such as apprenticeships and technical programs. (Applause.)
So, as president, I will get rid of the unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs — (applause) — to increase jobs for folks without a four-year degree, understanding that requiring a certain degree does not necessarily talk about one's skills. (Applause.) And I will challenge the private sector to do the same. (Applause.)
All of this to say, look, I come from the middle class. I understand where I come from, and I'm never going to forget that. And I will always put middle-class working people first. It will always be my priority — (applause) — always be my priority. I know where I come from. I know where I come from.
But now, Donald Trump has a different plan.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Just google — just — just look up the Google. (Laughter.) Just google Project 2025.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It is a detailed, dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he were elected president again. Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts, like he did before. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he wants to impose what I call the ""Trump sales tax"" on everyday basic necessities, which, as economists have reviewed, would cost the average family nearly $4,000 more a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: In fact, independent economists like Goldman Sachs have said my plan would grow our economy — (applause) — and his plan would shrink the economy, reignite inflation, and send us into a recession by the middle of next year.
On top of all of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act. And let's remember —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Like, we're not here with Trump amnesia. We remember. Remember, when he was president, he tried 60 times to end the Affordable Care Act. And as he said in the debate just this week, he has no — no plan to replace it. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. Right. You said it. He said he has, quote, ""concepts of a plan"" — ""concepts of a plan,"" no actual plan.
So, let's — let's just think about this for a moment. He's going threaten health insurance for the 45 million people who rely on it based on a concept and take us back —
AUDIENCE: Noo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — when insurance companies had — but — because we remember where that was. We remember what that was when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. Remember what that was like? Remember.
Well, we are —
AUDIENCE: Not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — not going back. We are not going back. (Applause.) No. We are not going back. (Applause.)
Because — because — because ours is a fight for the future. (Applause.) And — and ours is a fight for freedom — (applause) — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. (Applause.)
And we remember how we got here. Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intent that they would overturn Roe v. Wade, and they did exactly as he intended.
(Protestor interruption.)
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we — and we understand where we are. We understand where we are.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hey, listen. Listen. Now — now is the time to get a hostage deal and ceasefire. I — we have been working around the clock to get that done. (Applause.) And I respect your voice, but right now I am speaking. (Applause.)
So, on the issue — so, on the issue of fundamental rights and freedoms, we remember how he selected those members of the Supreme Court to undo Roe v. Wade. They did just as he intended. And what we have seen is, in state after state, they passed laws to criminalize health care providers, to punish women. Now, more than 20 states have a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — many with no exceptions for rape and incest, which is immoral. To tell a survivor of a violation to their body that they don't have a right to make a decision about what happens to their body next, that's immoral.
And let us agree: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do — (applause) — not the government.
And I will tell you, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly.
And I'm traveling our country, and I'll tell you, across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard-won fundamental freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote — (applause); the freedom to be safe from gun violence — (applause); the freedom to join a union — (applause); and the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.)
And generations — let's remember who we are as Americans. Generations before us led the fight for freedom. And to the friends here, I say: The baton is now in our hands. (Applause.) It is now in our hands.
And so much is on the line in this election. We all know and remember. This is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher than they were then, because two months ago, the United States Supreme Court essentially told the former president that he will effectively be immune no matter what he does, if he gets back into the White House.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Imagine what that might mean.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. He who has vowed, if reelected, he would be a dictator on day one.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He who calls for the, quote, ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States. And let us be clear: Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States of America should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. (Applause.) Never again. Never again.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, Pennsylvania, it all comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. (Applause.) We love — we love our country. And we who are here understand the awesome responsibility — the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth: the privilege and pride of being an American. (Applause.) That's right.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. (Applause.)
So, Pennsylvania, 53 days until Election Day. (Applause.) And we know ours will be a tight race until the very end. We are the underdog. We are the underdog. Let's remember that and know that. And we know how they play. We know how they play.
We are the underdog, and we have some very hard work ahead of us. But here's the thing. We like hard work. Hard work is good work. (Applause.)
And with your help, we will win. (Applause.) We will win.
So, Pennsylvania, today, I ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!

    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you, Gabby. (Applause.)
Thank you all so very much. I — first of all, Mayor, thank you for being here, and I (inaudible) — (applause). You've been — you've just been extraordinary as a leader and also as a friend, and I thank you so very much.
Hi, guys. (Applause.) I'm so happy to see you guys.
What schools are represented here?
AUDIENCE: (Inaudible.)
AUDIENCE MEMBER: UPenn!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay. (Laughter.) Poor guy. You're the only one in here from UPenn. (Laughter.) (Applause.)
Okay. Come on. (Laughter.) (Applause.)
I'm so happy to see you guys. You know, I — you guys know how I feel about you and your generation. You all are just killing it. And you are the reason — one of the reasons, for sure, that I am so optimistic and excited about the future of our country.
Your generation — seriously, because you guys — the thing I love about you: You're brilliant, you care, you are impatient. (Laughter.) You're like, ""I'm not waiting for somebody else to handle this; I'm going to work on getting it done,"" which is why you guys are all here.
You all have figured out — you know, I think we're all born as leaders, and it's a matter of when you decide to kick it in, and you all have decided to do that at this stage of your life in such a critical way.
And every issue that is at play in this election is going to directly impact you. And, of course, you know that, and that's why you're here, because you're taking matters into your own hands.
And I think it's really important at a moment like this, when there are some powerful forces, frankly, that are trying to diminish and belittle and suggest that, you know, we have nothing in common and divide us that leaders pull together, build community, build coalitions — right? — who really intentionally understand the power in the collective. And you all have figured that out in such an amazing way.
And I hope you're making friends with each other, because you're going to run into each other years from now like, ""Yeah, you remember '24 (inaudible)"" — (laughter). You guys are going to remember each other when — whether you decide to run for elected office or whatever you decide to do with your role of leadership. So, I hope you're making friends and enjoying each other as you build up what we need to do over the next 49 days.
In 49 days, we are going to make such a big difference, and we're going to win. We are winning this campaign. (Applause.) We are winning this campaign.
And I will tell you — and I will tell you, it's very, very important to me, and I know to you that our goal, yes, is that we must and will win and that through these next 49 days, we continue to build community and coalition. Let's leave something for the work we are doing right now that lifts people up, that strengthens people, that strengthens communities. Right? Let's have that as our co-equal goal, because that's when we really — combined with the goal, the ultimate goal of winning, that's when we're about building something that will be bigger than any one of us, and it's a great feeling.
You all have heard me say probably many times, I think part of what's wrong and backward thinking about what we've been seeing from some folks is the suggestion that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down, instead of what we all know: The true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.
So, let's do our work. (Applause.) Let's do our work in a way that is about doing just that, and that includes being a volunteer. You know, I've worked on many campaigns, and I don't know if some of you know, but I — my first political office that I ran for was freshman class representative of the liberal arts student council. (Laughter and applause.)
Mayor, it was a very tough race. I ran against this girl from Jersey. She was tough. (Laughter.) But I was from Oakland, so we were all right. (Laughter and applause.)
But I say all that to say that there is so much that you guys are going to do during these next days. It's about knocking on doors and talking with people. You know, I know everyone is living online and through their phones, but the power that I hope you have seen already and you're going to see over these next 49 days — there's an incredible power that comes with just looking somebody in the eye, shaking their hand, asking them, ""How are you doing? What are you concerned about? What are you worried about? What are your dreams? What are your hopes?""
It's an incredible, incredible thing you can do when you do that sincerely. And you're going to see that there's a lot of joy that comes with that experience, too, but an incredible amount of power.
And so, that's the — that's the joy of — of volunteering. You know, and you going to knock on doors, you're going to call. It is just as equally important. You know, I mean — you know, so many people in my life, they're like, ""You're the only person who leaves voicemails that I know."" (Laughter.) But they love my voicemails — (laughter) — because there's something about hearing another human's voice in addition to receiving a text message. Right?
And so, you're going to be doing the calls, and you're going to be texting, and you're going to be engaging. And it's a reciprocal relationship, and you're going to be receiving so much in the process.
So, thank you all for all that you are doing and that you're committing to do over these next 49 days. I know there are many other things you could be doing.
Don't put aside your studies. (Laughter.) You know, shower from time to time. (Laughter.) Try to eat vegetables when you can. (Laughter.)
But enjoy it and know — know, most importantly, you are making a difference. You are making a difference. Our country is relying on you guys. We really are.
So, keep at it. Thank you for everything. Today is National Voter Registration Day. We — voting registration, I believe, ends October 21st, so we've got, you know, about a month to get this done and make sure that people are registered. And then we're going to remind them about why it's important that they are, because their voice is their power; their power is their voice. We're going to remind people: Don't ever let anybody silence your power. (Applause.) Right? (Inaudible.)
So, with that, I'll see you all in these streets. And please take care. (Applause.) And be well.
And thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. (Applause.)

    MS. WINFREY: Kamala Harris!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi.
MS. WINFREY: So, welcome to --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Oprah --
MS. WINFREY: Oh, hello!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi. (Laughs.)
MS. WINFREY: Madam Vice President, hello. Welcome to Michigan.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's so good to be back.
And, Governor, thank you for everything you are and everything you do for this state. Thank you. (Applause.)
MS. WINFREY: Well --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
MS. WINFREY: Can you see this? We have a thousand --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Oh, my goodness.
MS. WINFREY: -- screens here --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Oh, my goodness.
MS. WINFREY: -- representing people from all over the country.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi, everyone. Oh, my goodness.
MS. WINFREY: Can you feel -- can you feel --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes.
MS. WINFREY: Can you feel it? Can you feel --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I can.
MS. WINFREY: -- the joy rising in here?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I can. And I -- I have to tell you, there is so much that I love about our campaign, because it really is about the people. And I look around at these screens, Oprah, I look at who's in the room, and this is America.
MS. WINFREY: This is.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: This is America. You know, I was saying with a group of friends earlier: I think, in this moment, where we've dealt with so much that I think is quite exhausting around powerful forces that would try and divide us --
MS. WINFREY: Yes.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and try us -- to have us, as Americans, pointing fingers at each other --
MS. WINFREY: Yes.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- that this movement that is about reminding each other that we have so much more in common than what separates us is so critically important, and this is about the strength of who we are as Americans. And this movement that we're in about, as I like to say, seeing in the face of a stranger, a neighbor.
MS. WINFREY: Yes, yes.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right?
MS. WINFREY: Yes, yes, yes.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: An extension of ""love thy neighbor,"" that you literally, in the face of a stranger, see a neighbor --
MS. WINFREY: Yes.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and approach each other with that level of dignity and grace and -- and kindness.
MS. WINFREY: Well, that's exactly what happened with --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You know?
MS. WINFREY: -- Win With Black Women.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes.
MS. WINFREY: I know you've known Jotaka --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Jotaka.
MS. WINFREY: -- for many years.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, my dear. Oh.
MS. WINFREY: Well, that's exactly what happened -- (applause) --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: She started it.
MS. WINFREY: -- tha- -- is that they had this big call --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Jotaka started it.
MS. WINFREY: They had the big call --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's your fault. (Laughs.)
MS. WINFREY: They had the big call and then said, ""Let's open the door.""
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MS. WINFREY: ""Let's open the door and invite everybody else in."" And everybody actually came.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Organically.
MS. WINFREY: Yes.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Organically.
MS. WINFREY: Yeah.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Like, this is the beauty of our country. I -- you know, there's so much at stake in this election, and, ultimately, the question before us is: What kind of country do we want to live in?
And the beauty of a democracy -- as long as we can hold on to it -- the beauty of a democracy is each of us has the power --
MS. WINFREY: That's right.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- each of us has the power --
MS. WINFREY: That's right. That's right.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- to answer that question.
MS. WINFREY: That's right. Everybody --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right?
MS. WINFREY: -- on this call and beyond has the power.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MS. WINFREY: But can I just start with this?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes, please.
MS. WINFREY: I have to say this, because in all of my private conversations -- Gayle and I have said this a hundred times --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MS. WINFREY: Ev- -- and everybody is saying it. You all have said it. I know you have. It seems to us that something happened to you the moment Joe Biden -- President Biden stepped aside and withdrew his candidacy, that a veil or something dropped, and you just stepped into your power. (Applause.)
I mean, literally, looking at you at a speech like the week before, which was a great speech, very nice -- (laughter) -- and then the next week --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Oprah. (Laughs.)
MS. WINFREY: -- I saw you walking in the thing -- (Oprah struts around the stage) -- (laughter and applause) -- and I said, ""What happened to you?""
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You know, we each have those moments in our lives where it's time to step up.
MS. WINFREY: Time to step up.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Time to step up, you know. (Applause.)
MS. WINFREY: Well, the moment you heard -- I mean, I really have been saying to people, it felt like a veil dropped, and you sort of stepped through that veil. Did -- did that actually -- did you feel like that?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I felt a sense of responsibility, to be honest with you. And with that, comes a sense of purpose.
But, I mean, we're all here, and you all are taking time out of your busy lives -- everyone here, everyone on the screen -- because there really is so much at stake. You know, I have spent the majority of my career being concerned about the well-being of other people.
MS. WINFREY: Yeah.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: As I have said, my career as a prosecutor, I never looked at a -- a victim or a witness and asked them, ""Are you a Republican or a Democrat?"" The only thing I ever asked them is, ""Are you okay?""
MS. WINFREY: ""Are you okay?"" I know, when I heard that --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You know?
MS. WINFREY: -- it touched me.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And traveling this country and knowing what is at stake in terms of fundamental freedoms, what's at stake in terms of fighting against hate and those -- those efforts to divide us, and I do know that I am in a position to do something about it.
So, I felt a great responsibility and -- and the incredible power of the people -- right? -- who -- and I'm not the only leader in this. We're all leaders in this.
This is so much bigger than me. It's about who we are as Americans, and it's about making clear what we stand for. And what we stand for is it is about the ideals upon which we were founded, including the importance of freedom and -- and the importance of independence and -- and the importance of dignity and -- and purpose, but it is also about what we stand for in terms of our values.
I -- I think of it this way --
MS. WINFREY: Yeah, I think a lot boils down to values. I just said: Values are --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It really does.
MS. WINFREY: -- on the line here. Yes.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It does. I mean, think about it, Oprah. The idea that some would suggest and that my opponent and -- suggests, which is that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down -- come on. The real measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. And it's -- it's important for us -- (applause) --
MS. WINFREY: Absolutely. And, you know --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- to articulate that.
MS. WINFREY: You know, ever since the debate, we feel for our fellow citizens in Springfield. Do you not --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MS. WINFREY: -- think about the fellow citizens in Springfield, Ohio; the Haitian families; the -- the non-Haitian families; everybody having to deal with this lie that has endangered the lives of Haitian people and anybody who looks Haitian? Everybody in America feels for that.
And I -- also, everybody in America -- left, right, middle -- has concerns about immigration.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MS. WINFREY: And I'm told that Justin -- Justin, where are you in the audience? Justin --
PARTICIPANT: Hello.
MS. WINFREY: -- in our audience.
PARTICIPANT: Hello, Madam Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi, Justin.
MS. WINFREY: You live in Michigan?
PARTICIPANT: Yes, ma'am.
MS. WINFREY: Don't you love saying, ""Hello, Madam Vice President""? (Laughter.)
PARTICIPANT: I do. I do.
MS. WINFREY: What's -- what's your question? It's an immigration question, I was told.
PARTICIPANT: My question for you is: When you become president, what would be your specific steps --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: With your help. (Laughter.)
PARTICIPANT: Yeah, of course. What would be your specific steps to strengthening the border?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, it's a wonderful and important question. I -- you know my background was as a prosecutor, and I was also the elected attorney general for two terms of a border state. So, this is not a theoretical issue for me. This is something I've actually worked on.
PARTICIPANT: Okay.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations for the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings. I take very seriously the importance of having a secure border and ensuring the safety of the American people.
Sadly, where we are now can be traced most recently back to the fact that when the United States Congress -- members of the Congress, including some of the most conservative Republicans, came up with a border security bill -- and here's what that border security bill would have done: It would have put 1,500 more border agents at the border.
And let me tell you, those border agents are working around the clock. It would have just been about giving them some support and relief, which is probably why the border agents actually endorsed the bill.
It would have allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl. And I'm looking at people from all over the country here, so I don't need to tell the folks who are watching this what fentanyl has done to families, to -- to kids in our country, and the need to take seriously stemming the flow coming into our country and addressing that extraordinary and -- and tragic issue in terms of its effect.
The bill would have allowed us to have more resources to prosecute transnational criminal organizations, and it would have been part of the solution.
And Donald Trump called up those folks and said, ""Don't put that bill on the floor for a vote."" He blocked the bill. And you know why?
PARTICIPANT: Why?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Because he'd prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. (Applause.)
And he has put his politil -- personal political security before border security. Because understand, even in the intervening months, what that bill would have done to give support to folks who care about this issue.
And this, again, gets to the point about what does leadership really look like, and is it about you or is it about the people?
PARTICIPANT: Right.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Is it about running on problems or fixing problems?
My work and my career has always been about saying, ""Let's fix problems.""
MS. WINFREY: So --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Let's address the needs, because we know it's within our capacity to do that.
MS. WINFREY: So, to answer Justin's question, now that that bill has gone and hasn't passed, will you reintroduce that?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Absolutely. And when I am elected president of the United States, I will make sure that bill gets to my desk, and I will sign it into law. (Applause.)
MS. WINFREY: Thank you, Justin.
PARTICIPANT: Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Justin.
MS. WINFREY: Listen to this. A majority of young Americans, 18 to 34, say that the cost of living is their top issue ahead of the election. Let's take a look.
(A video is played.)
Well, Rachael and Garrett are joining us on Zoom from Pennsylvania. And I understand your sister and brother-in-law moved in, and you're hoping to save money to have a second child.
PARTICIPANT: (Via teleconference.) That's right. Hi, Oprah. Hi, Madam Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi, guys.
PARTICIPANT: It's nice to be with you all.
MS. WINFREY: Yes.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi.
MS. WINFREY: And so --
PARTICIPANT: (Inaudible.)
MS. WINFREY: -- what did -- what did you want to say to the vice president?
PARTICIPANT: So, Madam Vice Predi- -- President, we are, like many, many young Americans, just experiencing a very high cost of living. We ended up giving up our apartment, moving in with our parents, who were so gracious to take us in for over a year so that we could save money and ultimately buy a home, because that's what we thought the American dream was: to --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yep. Yeah.
PARTICIPANT: -- to get married and buy a home and have a baby.
And now, here we are, and our mortgage is incredibly higher than what we thought it would be. And my sister and our brother-in-law are living with us right now so that they can hopefully one day do the same. And while it's beneficial for us because they help us pay off some of our mortgage, it's also beneficial for them because they can save on cheaper rent.
But we really would love to know what your plan is to help lower the cost of living.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. I -- first of all, thank you both for being here. And yours is a -- a story I hear around the country as I travel, and in terms of both rightly having the right to have aspirations and dreams and ambitions for your family and working hard and finding that the American dream is, for this generation and so many recently, far more elusive than it's been. And we need to deal with that, and there are a number of ways.
One is bringing down the cost of everyday necessities, including groceries. So, that's why I'm taking on, for example, price gouging, which is when -- you know, most companies and corporations are good, but for those bad ones, they take advantage of people, especially during a pandemic or extreme weather, and they end up jacking up prices. And there needs to be accountability and consequence for that. So, I'm going to be taking on price gouging.
But it's also about dealing with what we need to do around homeownership, right? So, as someone mentioned during this -- this film -- look, I grew up a child of a mother who worked very hard. She raised me and my sister. And she saved up, and by the time I was a teenager, she was able to buy a home.
And we grew up, actually, for a long time, in an apartment on top of a childcare center that was owned by the woman we called our second mother, because she helped my mother raise us, and she was a small business owner: Ms. Shelton.
So, I'll bring all this together to tell you: The way I think about it is, one, when people work hard and have a dream of buying a home, we should give you the opportunity to be able to do that, which is why part of my plan is for first-time homeowners -- -buyers to have a $25,000 down payment assistance to buy your first home. Because people just need -- (applause) -- to be able to get their foot in the door, and then you'll do the hard work.
Part of my plan is what we need to do to support small businesses, because my second mother was a small-business owner. And I love our small businesses and our small-business owners. They are not only business leaders, they are community leaders. They -- they mentor; they hire locally. And we have so many entrepreneurs in our country who have great ideas, incredible work ethic, but not necessarily access to capital, because not everybody, like my opponent, was handed $400 million on a silver plate that he filed bankruptcy six times on. (Laughter.)
And so, part of my plan is to give start-up small businesses a $50,000 tax deduction to start up their small business. Right now, it's $5,000. Nobody can start a small business with $5,000. So, that's part of my plan.
MS. WINFREY: It's -- that's a teeny-tiny business. (Laughter.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's -- that -- that's business in --
MS. WINFREY: $5,000 -- teeny-tiny business.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's a concept of a business. Right? (Laughter.)
MS. WINFREY: Yes.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You know where I'm going. (Laughs.)
MS. WINFREY: That's right.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And part of --
MS. WINFREY: It's still on paper with the $5,000.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. Right.
MS. WINFREY: It's still on paper.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It just hasn't happened. But --
MS. WINFREY: Right.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Part of the -- to speak to you guys and your family and your dreams -- is what we need to do around giving middle-class families tax breaks.
And so, part of my plan is also to ext- -- extend and expand the Child Tax Credit to $6,000, so that you can, in the first year of your child's life, have the resources to be able to buy a crib and a car seat and -- and clothes for your baby, knowing that's such an extraordinarily important time in their development and you shouldn't have to worry about how you're going to take care of their basic needs.
All of this and more is part of what I plan to build, and I call it an opportunity economy. And it's basically about creating opportunities, knowing so many people have the ambition, have the aspirations, are working hard, but just need opportunity to reach their goals and their dreams.
MS. WINFREY: I saw you smiling with that $25,000 credit for the home. I saw that smile on your face --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.)
MS. WINFREY: -- and the $6,000. Thank you all so much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you, guys.
MS. WINFREY: I want to just introduce you to Shelby, who's also in our virtual audience. (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you.
MS. WINFREY: Thank you, guys.
Shelby from Virginia, who's also struggling with the cost of living. Tell us your story, Shelby. Why?
PARTICIPANT: (Via teleconference.) Hi. Hi, Madam Vice President. Hi, Oprah.
I'm 24 years old. I'm a graduate student living with my parents, and I want to move out next year and potentially buy a home. And I'm concerned about the affordability of one --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
PARTICIPANT: -- with the extra cost and bills that I'm paying now, along with the bills and costs I will pay in the future too.
And so, everything just has a cost and everything is so expensive. And so, I'm worried about my capacity and how I'm able to fully support myself once I do live independently.
MS. WINFREY: You sound like one of my daughter girls from South Africa. Graduated -- she was like, ""I hate adulting."" (Laughter.) ""I hate adulting.""
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right.
MS. WINFREY: ""This adulting isn't going so well."" Yes.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, so par- -- first of all, congratulations on all the success you've already achieved. And it is -- your story and the story of our friends before you is really -- that's the American story, right? You -- you are working hard, you have goals, you have ambitions.
And so, part of it is, again, the $25,000 down-payment assistance.
Part of it is what we need to do to also push back against a very different vision for our country. Because, look, in this election, there are two very different visions for our country: One, for me, that is focused on the future, including you; and another that is focused on the past.
What Donald Trump -- what my opponent plans on doing for the economy is doing what he did the last time he was president, and giving another tax break for billionaires and the biggest corporations that would add $5 trillion to our deficit.
And get this. He plans on what -- doing what I call a ""Trump sales tax,"" which is, basically, he's going to put a 20 percent tax on everyday necessities that economists have estimated will cost the average American $4,000 more a year -- which is why Goldman Sachs, which is why Moody's, which is why Wharton School of Business, which is why 16 Nobel laureates have collectively determined after analyzing our plans, one, mine would strengthen the economy, his would weaken it; two, that on his plan, he would actually blow up inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year.
So, when you think about the cost of living, my approach is about lifting you up. His would be about actually weakening our economy.
And I feel very strongly when an individual, when a small business, when a family, when the middle class is strong, America is strong.
MS. WINFREY: Amen to that. Amen to that. (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right?
MS. WINFREY: Thank you, Shelby. Thank you, Rachael and Garrett.
So, the Harris campaign kicked off the Fighting for Reproductive Freedom bus tour to support the fundamental right for women to make decisions about our own bodies. And here is a short tape on that.
(A video is played.)
So, for the millions of you who watched the Democratic National Convention, you will remember Hadley Duvall telling her incredibly powerful story. And in case you didn't see it, here's just a brief look.
(A video is played.)
Hadley is here.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: There's Hadley.
MS. WINFREY: Stand up, Hadley. (Applause.)
I have to tell you, we are all standing up because we are so impressed by your courage to stand up and share your story.
Where did that come from, the strength to -- to do this? Because I'm sure you thought long and hard before deciding to go public with your story.
PARTICIPANT: When Roe v. Wade was overturned --
MS. WINFREY: Thanks, everybody.
PARTICIPANT: -- I woke up with a harsh reality of my abuse was over but my story is not. And I just could not fathom thinking about the other Hadleys out there that don't have that choice, that don't have somebody to go to. So, being able to find courage and be the light for them, that's -- that's really what I do it for.
MS. WINFREY: And so, what do you want to say to other people who are voting in this election regarding what happened to you and what that means?
PARTICIPANT: You can't wait until it's too late to care about reproductive health care, because then it's too late. And when it affects you, it -- it hits, and it -- you can't deny it. You can't look at someone with a story like mine and say it didn't happen. And there are more people like me out there, and there are going to be so many more who deserve their options. They deserve their choices.
Let's get involved. We have someone who's willing to hear us at a level like never before. We have someone who wants to know what we want in this country. We have someone who wants to lift up our voice, and we need to show out and show up for her, just like she's showing out and showing up for us. (Applause.)
MS. WINFREY: All right.
Is there something wanted to say to Madam Vice President?
PARTICIPANT: Madam Vice President, I just want to say thank you. Thank you for seeing us, for hearing us when the Supreme Court won't. Thank you for fighting and, you know, really showing us that life is -- is not about the hard things that you go through. You don't bow down --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right.
PARTICIPANT: -- even when you're the underdog -- especially when you're the underdog --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right.
PARTICIPANT: -- you stand up and you stand tall. And you give me so much hope and so much strength. And thank you. (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Aw, Hadley. Honestly --
MS. WINFREY: Thank you, Hadley, for coming all this way. I hope you continue to use your voice. I hope you continue that.
This week, the case of a young woman who lost her life after the abortion ban took place in Georgia made national headlines. Amber's case came to light through the reporting of journalist Kavitha Surana with Pro- -- ProPublica. And so, listen to her story.
(A video is played.)
Amber's mother, Shanette, and older sisters C.J. and Andrika are here, and they -- are they wanted to be here tonight to speak out for the first time.
Ms. Shanette, what do you want us to know about Amber's story?
PARTICIPANT: Initially, I did not want the public to know my pain. I wanted to go through it in silence, but I realized that it was selfish.
I want y'all to know Amber was not a statistic. She was loved by a family -- a strong family, and we would have done whatever to get my baby, our baby, the help that she needed.
When ProPublica came to my home, I pushed them away. ""No. No. No."" But Kavitha, she kept -- she was persistent. She said it was something that you needed to know; you have to hear me: Women around the world, people around the world, need to know that this was preventable.
Two years later, after speaking with my daughters -- because I lost strength; I lost hope -- you're looking at a mother that is broken. The worst pain ever that a mother, that a parent could ever feel -- her father and myself and the family -- you're looking at it.
MS. WINFREY: Well, we appreciate so deeply you being here. And I -- we're all watching you hear that tape and those words. We know how re-traumatizing that is and the strength it takes for you to be here to tell your story, and we deeply appreciate it.
And I have to ask you, as her sisters, how are you coping? And what does knowing that this could have been prevented -- how does -- how does that sit with you? How do you cope with that on a daily basis?
PARTICIPANT: I mean, it's heartbreaking. You know, that was my baby sister. I loved my baby sister, you know? I'm beyond hurt. I'm disappointed. I feel guilty. I wish I could have helped her, you know, because she was suffering.
And we had no idea. We trusted them to take care of her, you know? And they just let her die because -- because of some stupid abortion ban. They treated her like she was just another number. They didn't care for her as if, you know, she was their daughter or their, you know, granddaughter.
MS. WINFREY: Yeah.
PARTICIPANT: You know, and she's not here. She'll never come back.
MS. WINFREY: Yeah. Andrika, what do you want to say?
PARTICIPANT: I want to say that it's -- it's very disheartening that my sister was allowed to suffer for 20 hours. She suffered. There was nothing that we could do to help her. We trusted the health care professionals to do their job and save her, but they failed her.
MS. WINFREY: Well, I think the most powerful thing that you've said here, Ms. Shanette, is that your daughter is not a statistic. She had a life. She was loved by her sisters, loved by her family, loved by those who knew her. And she's not just a tis- -- statistic. And we are happy to speak her name tonight.
In -- in this room, talking about what this country needs in terms of reproductive rights and freedom, what do you want to say, Madam Vice President?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I'm just so sorry. And the courage that you all have shown is extraordinary, because also you just learned about how it is that she died. And --
MS. WINFREY: They just recently learned, yes.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: How, yeah.
MS. WINFREY: Yeah, yeah.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And -- and Amber's mom shared with me that the word over and over again in her mind is ""preventable.""
MS. WINFREY: Yeah.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: ""Preventable."" That word keeps coming to her.
And this story is a story that is, sadly, not the only story of what has been happening since these bans have taken place.
And, you know, so the -- just to step back in terms of how we got here. The former president chose three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would overdo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended.
And in state after state, including yours, these abortion bans have been passed that criminalize health care providers. In a couple of states, prison for life, Oprah -- prison for life in a couple of states for a doctor or nurse who provides health care.
And so, it -- it seems very apparent that --
MS. WINFREY: Even when the -- even when the mother's life is in danger.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But see, here's the problem with that. Here's the problem with that. So, is she on death's door before you actually decide to give her help?
MS. WINFREY: Mm-hmm. That's the problem. (Applause.) That's the problem.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Is that what we're saying?
MS. WINFREY: Yeah. That you've got to prove --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That --
MS. WINFREY: -- you're on death's door.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Like, literally, a doctor or a nurse has to say, ""She might die any minute. Better give her now care, because otherwise I might go to prison for life,"" in some cla- -- cases.
Think about what we're doing in terms of saying that certain people who are in these state houses -- and then starting with the former president of the United States -- think they're in a better position than a doctor or a nurse to determine when their patient needs medical care.
This literally -- and -- and Amber's story highlights the fact that among everything that is wrong with these bans and what has happened in terms of the overturning of Wa- -- Roe v. Wade, it's a health care crisis. It's a health care crisis that affects the patient and the profession.
And going back to Hadley's story -- and, Hadley, you've been so remarkable --
PARTICIPANT: Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- in telling your story and being so strong in the way you do it. And both of these stories -- really, I mean, the courage for -- out of pain, for you to tell these stories to help other people is e- -- is just extraordinary. It's -- and, Hadley, and -- and I'm -- you just -- you've been so remarkable.
You know, I -- Oprah, I don't know if you know this, but when I was in high school, I learned that my best friend was being molested by her stepfather.
MS. WINFREY: Yes. Yes. We heard that story on the -- at the DNC, yes.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MS. WINFREY: Yes.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And -- and I said to her --
MS. WINFREY: And you had the courage then to go to her and say, ""You've got to come"" --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: ""You come"" --
MS. WINFREY: -- ""to our house.""
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- ""you have to come"" -- yeah. And she came to stay with us. I called my mother, and she came to stay with us.
And the idea that these same legislators who would be saying, you know, ""criminalize health care providers"" are also saying that after a person's body has been violated, that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next -- that's immoral.
MS. WINFREY: Yeah. (Applause.) I think it --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's immoral.
MS. WINFREY: -- it's not just immoral. And here's -- here's what I want to say: I just don't believe that those legislators, that the government has a right to be in your womb. They have no right to be in your womb with decisions about your womb.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And one does not have to abandon their faith --
MS. WINFREY: Right.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do. (Applause.)
MS. WINFREY: Absolutely. Absolutely.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right? If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, or her imam, but not the government telling her what's in her be- -- best interest.
MS. WINFREY: Well, this is a long healing process for this family, and we thank you, and we hope that by being amongst people who heard you and heard your daughter's story will be meaningful to you in this journey to healing. Thank you so much for being here.
Okay, I want to also -- (applause). Thank you.
I want to hear from Star Walker, who is a campaign engagement organizer in Milwaukee -- one of my hometowns, Milwaukee.
Hi, Star. What's going on in Wisconsin?
PARTICIPANT: (Via teleconference.) Hi, Oprah. Hi, Madam Vice President. We are fired up here in Wisconsin. I'm an engagement organizer, so I'm focused on (inaudible) -- (applause) -- within their personal networks, as friends, family, teammates. Yeah, and by empowering people to leverage their relationships, we amplify their voices and deliver progress.
We're fired up, but we also know it's a razor-thin race. So, just like in 2020, this is going to be won by a field margin. It's on us to roll up our sleeves and do the work. Let's make phone calls and knock on doors. Go to Go.KamalaHarris.com to join this people-powered movement. That way, when we look back, we won't just be remembering how we felt, we'll be remembering what we did.
Thank you. (Applause.)
MS. WINFREY: Wooo! I love that. I love that. Y'all, I love that. That's a big takeaway, because we are feeling really good right now, but it -- what really matters is: What are we going to do?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Absolutely.
MS. WINFREY: What are we going to do?
Thank you so much, Star.
I see somebody else on the screen. Julia Roberts! Hi, Julia.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi, Julia.
MS. ROBERTS: (Via teleconference.) Hi. Hi.
MS. WINFREY: I heard you were so excited; you wanted to be here tonight. Why?
MS. ROBERTS: Well, first of all, Oprah, thank you for hosting this, because, I guess, if I started a voting club, it would be ""Conversationalists for Kamala"" --
MS. WINFREY: Yes. Yes. (Laughter.)
MS. ROBERTS: -- because to -- to talk, to -- to listen, to be heard, to have this back-and-forth is so unique in this campaign to beautiful, wonderful Kamala Harris, who I have had the good fortune of knowing for many years.
And I am a mother of two kids. This is their first chance to vote in an election -- (applause) -- and I couldn't be more excited for them to have the legacy to say that their first vote they ever cast for president was for you. I have just chills saying that out loud.
MS. WINFREY: Are you all going to the polls together? Are you organizing a party? Are the Moders --
MS. ROBERTS: We --
MS. WINFREY: -- having a poll party? What's happening?
MS. ROBERTS: (Laughs.) I wish we were all going together. In fact, you know, they are in college, so we will be separated on the great day. But -- but in spirit, united always for what we believe in and what we --
You know, I feel like it's interesting. We talk so much about being Americans united for something, but this has become such a global representation of our country and what we stand for. And I get to travel internationally a lot, and I want people to say, ""Oh, you're American"" and not ""Oh. Huh. How's it going over there?"" (Laughter.) You know?
MS. WINFREY: Yes.
MS. ROBERTS: So, I want to get back to that space. (Applause.)
MS. WINFREY: Exactly.
MS. ROBERTS: And I -- and I just --
MS. WINFREY: Thank you, Julia. Exactly. Thank you.
And, hey, there's Tracee Ellis Ross coming up there.
Tracee, we sh- -- now, listen --
MS. ROSS: (Via teleconference.) Hi.
MS. WINFREY: If anybody should have a voting party, I think it should be at your house, because you have great parties, girl. (Laughter.)
MS. ROSS: I just want to say hi. Hello, Madam Vice President. It -- Ma- -- Ma- -- it's just an honor. I actually have never met you --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I know.
MS. ROSS: -- which is -- which is crazy. And hi, Oprah. (Laughter.)
I am here because -- wait, what did I miss?
MS. WINFREY: You go -- she go- -- we just saw each other the other day. Okay. (Laughter.)
Oh, hi, Tracee. Hi.
MS. ROSS: We did. Hi, Oprah. How are you doing?
MS. WINFREY: Good. (Laughs.) Yeah.
MS. ROSS: Okay.
MS. WINFREY: This is exciting, though, isn't it? Isn't it exciting?
MS. ROSS: It's exciting. It's exciting because I believe in democracy. I believe in the future of our country, in reproductive freedom, bodily autonomy, women leading. I believe in decency. The idea of leading with joy and kindness has always been in my DNA. And I'm here both for the seriousness of this election but the joy with which it is being handled. It is stunning.
And then, I -- I also really want to remind everybody -- it hasn't been mentioned -- but voting up and down the ballot -- (applause) -- is incredibly important. Your freedom and your daily life are -- are all the way up and down that ballot. People are policies, and we need the right people in all areas --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right.
MS. ROSS: -- all -- all positions.
And then, I would like to say to you two women: Thank you for what you represent, because as a 52-year-old childless woman, I want to say to the people who think that a woman's worth is measured in her baby count -- I mean, shout out to all the amazing mothers -- but the childless women have been mothering the world and elevating culture -- (applause) -- as aunties, godmothers, teachers, mentors, sisters, and friends and the list go- -- goes on, and you do not need to push out a baby to help push humanity forward.
MS. WINFREY: Amen to that. Thank you so much. Tracee Ellis Ross. (Applause.) Thank you so much.
So, another important issue of this election is, of course, our safety. And just two weeks ago, our country experienced yet another horrific school shooting. Watch this.
(A video is played.)
We live in a country where 383,000 children have been exposed to gun violence. Now just sit with that number for a second. It's a number until it's your child.
This is not normal, y'all.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MS. WINFREY: This is not normal, and this is not right. Other people in other countries do not have this issue. We -- Americans, we have to do better. We have to do better. (Applause.) We cannot continue to just settle for your ""our thoughts and prayers."" Lives are being destroyed.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right.
MS. WINFREY: Fifteen-year-old Natalie Griffith and her parents, Doug and Marilda, are here. And, Natalie, we are so sorry to know that you, too, have been added to that number because you were in algebra class when you were shot twice by a 14-year-old fellow student.
We're so glad that you lived to tell your story. And so, how are you tonight?
PARTICIPANT: Well, before that thing -- the video, I was ver- -- I was very happy. I still am very happy to be here and to -- and to tell my story and what hap- -- and what happened, because it was a terrible thing, and it should -- and it should not have -- what's it called --
PARTICIPANT: Never happened.
MS. WINFREY: Where were you shot? Where were you physically shot?
PARTICIPANT: I was right here on my shoulder, and then around here, right --
PARTICIPANT: Her wrist.
PARTICIPANT: -- around my wrist.
MS. WINFREY: I was saying that 383,000 students in our country, the United States of America, have been -- been exposed to violence -- that same scene that you experienced in your school. Had you all been having, you know, drills or preparation --
PARTICIPANT: Yes.
MS. WINFREY: -- for what should happen should there be a shooting?
PARTICIPANT: We have -- I've had intruder drills and fire drills and stuff in my old schools. We had -- we have had a fire drill at Apalachee, but it was the first two months of -- of the school year. We hadn't had an -- had an intruder drill yet.
So, we didn't even -- we weren't even completely sure where to go in the classroom. We all just -- I remember being like huddled and (inaudible).
MS. WINFREY: So, I was watching your mother, even just when that tape was coming on. It's still very much PTSD, very much traumatic. You're still reliving it. And how has it been for you? How did you -- how were you notified that there was a shooting at the school?
PARTICIPANT: I was notified by a friend. She called me. I was at work, and she called me, and she said, ""Do you know about the shooting?"" Which -- with the school that she goes to, the Apalachee. I said, ""No, I don't."" And then she said, ""There was a shooter at the Apalachee High School."" My dr- -- my heart just dropped. In my heart, it just got so heavy, and I could not stop -- I just like -- I had to leave.
I told my coworkers, ""I got to go. I have to leave."" And my first thing I did is drop my knee on the floor and just start praying. I prayed for about 30 minutes from my -- from my work on the way to the s- -- I didn't get to get to the school on my car. I had to leave my car at a gas station about two -- maybe two and a half, three miles, and I walk on foot.
And I ran because my heart was so heavy, I could not get -- I couldn't get in touch with my daughter.
MS. WINFREY: And I hear you have a message for people in power regarding guns now.
PARTICIPANT: I do. I want to finish that story, because no parent should go through this. I want to just finish what --
MS. WINFREY: Yes, go ahead.
PARTICIPANT: -- you know, the whole -- the experience -- you do not know what feels until it's you.
MS. WINFREY: Yes.
PARTICIPANT: You know, all those numbers that you show on the TV --
MS. WINFREY: Yes.
PARTICIPANT: -- you know, a lot of people that are here are mothers. You know, what are we doing about this? What are we doing? Let's make sure that everybody listens. Let's make sure that everybody hears it. The whole world needs to hear that we women that have our children, we have a job. That job is to protect our children. That job is to protect our nation. That job is to protect our country. (Applause.)
We cannot let -- we cannot leave -- we cannot let that go on. We have to stop it.
You know, where -- I was asking earlier, where are those people (inaudible) the shooting? Where are they? They needed to make a noise. I'm ready to make a noise about this, and I'm ready to stop it. Because no one -- no one knows what feels when you can't find your child. When you call her and you call her and she's not answering.
When I went through it, you know, it's just me that knows it. And I'm sure -- I'm so sorry for those that lost -- their -- their children actually died. I can actually hug my child. My child is here. And I gave all these praise to my -- the Lord, our Father in Heaven saved my child. You know, but the other two mothers there lost their kids, and there are the teachers that died.
You know, those people are suffering like I'm suffering. I'm very sorry for them. I'm very sorry that they lost the pe- -- their loved ones.
MS. WINFREY: And you have a message for the people in power.
PARTICIPANT: Yes, the people in power: Let's make it a change. Let's make happen. Let's make -- you know, let's just not hear about this. Who wants to just hear about this? (Applause.) We got to change it. We got to make it happen. You know?
MS. WINFREY: And, Doug -- Doug, I hear you're not a registered Democrat, but you now say it doesn't matter what side of the aisle you're on when it comes to this issue. What change do you want to see now that it has affected your family?
PARTICIPANT: You know, common sense. You know, I think a first step would just be metal detectors in schools -- you know, make a budget, make a plan. And -- and the people that say, ""Well, we've never really done stuff like that before."" I don't care. You know, they didn't have metal detectors at airports at one time. You know, they didn't have metal detectors at courthouses.
They -- you know, I think that if a child knew that he would -- would get caught that the likelihood of him trying would be -- they may -- there may be another target, but it wouldn't be us having to worry about schools being hardened. Or, you know --
MS. WINFREY: Yeah. Yeah.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. I mean, I think that Doug has said it so eloquently, which is, we just need to apply common sense. And, look, I think for far too long on the issue of gun violence, some people have been pushing a really false choice to suggest you're either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone's guns away.
I'm in favor of the Second Amendment, and I'm in favor of assault weapons bans -- (applause) -- universal background checks, red flag laws. And these are just common sense. These are just common sense.
MS. WINFREY: I thought it was so powerful at the convention when you s- -- when -- when you said you have guns -- no, at the debate. At the debate when you s- --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I'm a gun owner. Tim Walz is a gun owner.
MS. WINFREY: I did not know that. (Laughter.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And if somebody breaks into my house --
MS. WINFREY: And I thought that was powerful.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- they're getting shot. (Laughs.) I'm sorry.
MS. WINFREY: Yes. Yes. I -- I hear that. I hear that.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Probably should not have said that. (Laughter.)
MS. WINFREY: But I --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: My staff will deal with that later.
MS. WINFREY: Yeah. (Laughter.)
But you have been a gun ow- -- gun owner for a while.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes, I have.
MS. WINFREY: Yes.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But -- but here's -- here's my point, Oprah, is that I'm not trying to take everyone's guns away. I believe in the Second Amendment.
But we have to agree that -- look, I -- I did, last fall, a -- a college tour with college-age young people. So, I also did trade schools. And packed audience every time in their auditorium, and I would ask, ""Please raise your hand if at any point between kindergarten and 12th grade, you had to endure an active shooter drill."" Almost every hand went up. It was bone-chilling.
MS. WINFREY: Yeah. This is the way our kids --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's bone-chilling.
MS. WINFREY: -- are living. Yeah.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And think about it. You know, I grew up -- we had fire drills only -- well, I grew up in California, we also had earthquake drills.
But the fact that our children are sitting in a classroom where they should be fulfilling their God-given potential and exploring the wonders of the world, and some part of their brain realizes somebody could bust through that classroom drawer -- door with a -- with a weapon -- with an assault weapon.
And -- and let's all agree that the -- the trauma so many children, even those who have not directly experienced the tragedy --
MS. WINFREY: Just being in the environment.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I --
MS. WINFREY: Just being in the environment.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I cannot tell you the number of young people who -- I mean, our kids had active shooter drills -- that -- that they're concerned that there might be somebody who would kill them while they are at school. This is not the sign of a civil society.
MS. WINFREY: It is not.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we -- it doesn't have to be this way.
MS. WINFREY: It doesn't have to --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It does not have to be this way.
MS. WINFREY: -- be this way.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But we need to have the courage to act. I mean, look, my opponent, when he was told and -- and knew about a -- a shooting of a young girl, you know what he said? ""Get over it."" ""Get over it."" No, we're not getting over it. No.
And -- and to the point, everyone should have a sense of collective responsibility for the children of our community --
MS. WINFREY: Yes.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and understand their right to live and be safe.
I have personally prosecuted homicide cases. I know -- I've -- autopsies. I've seen autopsies. I've seen what these weapons do to the human body. And we've got to agree that, in particular, when we're talking about something like an assault weapon, it's literally designed to be a tool of war. It has no place on the streets of a civil society. (Applause.) It's designed to kill a lot of human beings quickly.
And there are things we can do. I mean, thankfully, over the last three years --
MS. WINFREY: Gosh, it just seems like --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we've done some.
MS. WINFREY: -- common sense. It seems like --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But it is common sense.
MS. WINFREY: It just seems like common sense. We would see this. We would see this.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I think so.
MS. WINFREY: And I think that the majority of Americans agree with you --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MS. WINFREY: -- that we do not want assault weapons in the hands of children and other people who have no business with those types of weapons. (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. Right.
MS. WINFREY: We know this is true. So, we thank you, Natalie, and your family, for being here.
PARTICIPANT: Thank you for --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
MS. WINFREY: And good luck in that marching band this year. I hear you're going to go out for the marching band still.
PARTICIPANT: Thank you for inviting us.
MS. WINFREY: Thank you.
PARTICIPANT: It's -- it's -- we are -- unfortunately, it's a sad moment for us, but I wanted to make sure that, you know, we came because we needed to be heard and we needed to -- you know, change has to be made. It -- and we ready to fight for this.
MS. WINFREY: Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)
Okay. We want to hear what's going on in another battleground state. Tracey is a regional organizing director in Nevada.
Tracey, tell us how things are going for you. Hi.
PARTICIPANT: (Via teleconference.) Hi, everybody. I'm Tracey Ly, a regional organizing director in Nevada. I'm in the Silver State this year because there's so much on the line. From health care to lowering costs, these inch- -- these issues impact all of us.
My team and I have been building relationships with voters across this state, because, here in Nevada, we know that enthusiasm alone does not win campaigns; organizing does.
So, all of you watching tonight can become organizers. Whether you talk to your sister, a roommate, or a grandparent about why you're so excited to vote for Vice President Harris, you are organizing and energizing other supporters.
So, please go to Go.KamalaHarris.com to find ways to help. And enjoy the rest of tonight's event, and let's get to work.
MS. WINFREY: Let's get to work. Let's do something. (Applause.)
Meryl Streep, hello. You and I -- hi, Meryl Streep. (Applause.)
MS. STREEP: (Via teleconference.) Hi. (Laughs.)
MS. WINFREY: You and I have talked about this moment.
MS. STREEP: Hi, hi, hi.
MS. WINFREY: How are you feeling? How are you feeling about the momentum?
MS. STREEP: Oh, man. This -- this has been overwhelming to have the privilege to sit in and -- and listen to the testimony of the people here.
Hello, President Harris -- oh.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Not yet.
MS. STREEP: (Inaudible.) (Laughter and applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Forty-seven days.
MS. WINFREY: Forty-seven days, yes.
MS. STREEP: (Laughs.) From my mouth to God's ear. (Laughter.)
And hello, Oprah.
I think the word of the day has been ""preventable."" Preventable. All of this, the surround of hatred and --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MS. STREEP: -- and venom and toxicity and encouraging some segment of Americans to hate other segment of Americans --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MS. STREEP: -- it's just crazy, and nobody wants it. We're done.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right.
MS. STREEP: We're done with it.
I'm just -- I wanted to ask you -- (laughs) -- I can't believe I have this opportunity. (Laughter.) I probably never will again. (Laughter.)
If -- I have a little Debbie Downer moment, because, actually, I think you're going to win. I'm sure you're going to win. I think -- (applause) -- yeah. But what happens when you win --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MS. STREEP: -- and he doesn't accept it? And you know that there's going to be this long slog of shenanigans. And I'm wondering wh- -- how we get to that moment, how we preserve certification on January 6th? Because if it doesn't happen, it'll be maybe thrown back to the legislatures of the states.
And I've been -- I've been working with State Government Citizens' Campaign, which is SGC[C]America.com, so -- they're -- they're a great -- they're doing the -- the unglamorous, down-ballot work of promoting those -- those candidates. Because we really -- I'm worried about it. And I wonder -- I wonder if we're ready for January 7th, 8th, 9th, and what happens. What happens?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, we will be ready. But just taking a step back and -- and thank you, Meryl, for your -- just the gift that you give: you -- you are a -- you -- your talent and your creativity. Thank you for being here.
One of the things that I have realized in the course of our campaign is that more Americans than we may realize who voted for Trump before have decided January 6th was just a bridge too far. It -- when we reflect and think about what January 6th was, where the president of the United States, sitting in the Oval Office, incited a mob, a violent mob, to attack the United States Capitol, such that 140 law enforcement officers were injured -- some were killed -- to -- to try and upend a free and fair election where the American people voted -- that was a bridge too far for a lot of people.
And we have sadly now seen how far he could go. And I think there is absolutely no tolerance whatsoever for the vast majority of Americans for that. And they've seen the lies.
They understand, for example, almost every court case -- I think every court case where he's challenged an election he lost. I said on the debate stage, look, because he's having a very difficult time, obviously, processing the fact that 81 million people fired him. (Applause.) Right?
But -- so, there is that: that it really was a bridge too far for so many people that they are not willing to repeat. But the other piece of it is the lawyers are working. The -- it's very important that we all speak to our friends and our neighbors about misinformation and help them now see how it occurs, where it is occurring. It is important that we stand up for the integrity of poll workers and people who are working on Election Day.
And -- and that we also -- and this is critically important, that we ask people to be alert about mis- and disinformation, and we ask them, ""Do not be afraid to vote."" Because I think there is also something quite insidious about these attacks on the electorate in these various forms that are intended to convince people that their vote won't matter. And, in that way, there's a little bit of reverse psychology going on here, and let's -- let's just make sure nobody falls for it.
Your vote does matter, and we cannot let anyone ever take our power from us. We can never let anybody silence us. (Applause.)
And when we get those votes out, starting soon -- early voting is already going to start this week, I think -- through November 5th. And let's make sure everyone votes. And we are going to have a good Election Day. We're going to fight for the integrity of the people's voice and for our democracy.
And, you know, I'll just mention. Earlier, a couple of folks talked about what this means in terms of the world. You know, Oprah, as -- as vice president, I have -- I've met over 150 world leaders: presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings. And the thing about representing the United States of the America is when we walk in those rooms around the world, we have historically and traditionally been able to walk in those rooms chin up, shoulders back, with the self-appointed and earned authority to talk about the importance of democracies.
People around the world are watching right now. Because, you see, the thing about walking into a room and being a role model is people watch what you do to see if it lines up with what you say.
And, in that way, the consequences of this election are directly going to impact the American people and people around the world. That's what we're fighting for and those are the stakes.
And that's why we're going to win, because we know what we're fighting for. We -- because we know what we stand for. (Applause.)
MS. WINFREY: Thank you, Meryl.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
MS. WINFREY: So -- thank you, Meryl.
What is on your heart to say to the American people, as we have 47 days until November 5th? What's on your heart --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We --
MS. WINFREY: -- to say to particularly those people who are still undecided or maybe indifferent or on the fence still?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We love our country. I love our country. I know we all do. That's why everybody is here right now. We love our country. We -- we take pride in the privilege of being American.
And this is a moment where we can and must come together as Americans, understanding we have so much more in common than what separates us. Let's come together with the -- the character that we are so proud of about who we are, which is we are an optimistic people. We are an optimistic people.
Americans, by character, are people who have dreams and ambitions and aspirations. We believe in what is possible. We believe in what can be. And we believe in fighting for that.
That's how -- that's how we came into being, because the people before us understood that one of the greatest expressions for the love of our country, one of the greatest expressions of patriotism, is to fight for the ideals of who we are, which includes freedom to make decisions about your own body; freedom to be safe from gun violence; freedom to have access to the ballot box; freedom to be who you are and just be, to love who you love openly and with pride; freedom to just be. And that's who we are. We believe in all that.
And so, this is a moment where we stand, knowing what we are fighting for. We're not fighting against. It's what we're fighting for.
MS. WINFREY: Thank you. Thank you. Madam Vice President. (Applause.) Thank you.
And I want to say -- (applause) -- thank you, Madam Vice President. I also want to say: Thank you, Jotaka. (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Jotaka.
MS. WINFREY: Thank you, Jotaka Eaddy and the Win With Black Women, who started the gatherings on Zoom and all of the grassroots.
Now each of you listening tonight, you become your own grassroots organization to go forward and do something, coming together for the largest Zoom call we've all ever had.
Thank you so much. (Applause.)
And I just want to say -- I just want to say, for all of you watching who are still on the fence -- you're in the middle; you're independent, as I am -- or whether you're -- just still don't know what you're going to do: This is the moment for all decent people, all caring people who want the best for yourself and you want the best for other people. This is the moment for people who are tired of all of the bickering and all of the name-calling; people who are exhausted by the craziness --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MS. WINFREY: -- and the made-up stories and the conspiracies. This is the moment. You want to get on with your life, because you know that we can do better and that we deserve better.
You know this. I know you know this. I know you feel this. I know this is what you're saying amongst yourselves. It's in all the conversations that we're having, that you're having.
And we're better than this. We're better.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're better than this.
MS. WINFREY: We're better.
And we want to create a world where our children will be safe in school again. And as my friend and mentor Maya Angelou always said, ""When you know better, you got to --
AUDIENCE: Do better.
MS. WINFREY: -- do better."" Thank you.
So, let's do better and vote for Kamala Harris. (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Oprah.
MS. WINFREY: Thank you to all of our special guests. Thank you for sharing your stories, for being here -- Ms. Shanette. (Applause.)
Vice President Harris, we thank you. We hope you keep fighting for us --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I will.
MS. WINFREY: -- and the country we deserve to have.
Thank you so much. (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Oprah.
MS. WINFREY: To find out more about how you can register or where you can vote, go to IWillVote.com.
Good night, everybody.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good night.
MS. WINFREY: Thank you on Zoom. (Applause.) Thank you.

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Atlanta, Georgia
  


  

  
    September 20, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Can we please hear it for Dr. Reddick? Please. (Applause.)
Please have a seat, everyone. Please have a seat.
It's so good to be back in Atlanta. Thank you all. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Thank you.
You know, I — I just want to say —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible) to have you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Laughter.)
I just — I want to say about Dr. Reddick — you know, I — some of you may have seen I did a — an event last night with Oprah Winfrey and — (applause) — and that — it highlighted so many tragic stories, but it also highlighted so many important issues, which is why everyone has taken time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon. And it highlighted the importance of a Dr. Reddick.
AUDIENCE: Yes.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Because the courage, Dr. Reddick, that you are showing in the face of these arcane and immoral laws, to stand so publicly and talk about your commitment to your oath and to the health and well-being of people who need to be seen and treated with dignity is so extraordinary.
And I do believe, in moments of crisis, the world has a way of revealing the heroes among us. (Applause.) And I would say, Dr. Reddick, you are one of them. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, thank you, thank you.
And thank you to all of the elected and community leaders who have joined us today. (Applause.) Thank you, thank you, everybody — everybody who is here.
So, Georgia, the- — this election right here is a fight for the future. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom — for freedom.
And we know, in America, freedom is not to be given. It is not to be bestowed. It is ours by right. (Applause.) It is ours by right, and that includes the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. (Applause.) Yes, we must trust women.
And we all know how we got here. When Donald Trump was president, he hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court — the court of Thurgood and RBG — with the intention that they would overturn the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did.
And now more than 20 states have Trump abortion bans — extremists that have passed laws that criminalize health care providers, doctors and nurses, and punish women. In two states of those states, they provide for prison for life — prison for life for health care providers for simply providing reproductive care, the care they so earnestly and rightly believe must be delivered. All Trump abortion bans.
And think about this: Many of these bans make no exception even for rape and incest.
Now, many of you know I started my career as a prosecutor specializing in crimes of violence against women and children. What many of you may not know is why.
So, when I was in high school, my best friend, I learned, was being molested by her stepfather. And I said to her, ""Look, you've got to come and stay with us."" I called my mother. She said, ""Of course she does."" And she came and she stayed with us.
And so, I made the decision early in my life that I wanted to do the work that was about protecting the most vulnerable among us and doing the work that was about giving them dignity in the process.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And so — well, thank everybody here for being here, standing in solidarity around the importance of that. (Applause.)
And so, I say to you, then, from that experience and from the work that I've done, the idea that someone who survives a crime of violence to their body — a violation of their body — would not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next, that's immoral. That's immoral.
And let us agree, and I know we do: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do. (Applause.)
If she chooses — if she chooses, she will talk with her pastor, her priest, her rabbi, her imam. But it should not be the government or Donald Trump telling her what to do with her body. (Applause.)
And think about it — the stories that Dr. Reddick shares with us, the stories we heard last night, the stories we've been hearing for two years.
One in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban. This includes Georgia and every state in the South except Virginia.
Think about that when you also combine that with what we know has been long-standing neglect around an issue like maternal mortality. Think about that when you compound that with what has been long-standing neglect of women in communities with a lack of the adequate resources they need for health care — prenatal, during their pregnancy, postpartum. Think about that.
And these hypocrites want to start talking about ""this is in the best interest of women and children."" (Applause.) Well, where you been? Where you been — (applause) — when it comes to taking care of the women and children of America? Where you been?
How dare they? How dare they? Come on.
And — and we understand the impact of these bans and the horrific reality that women and families — their husbands, their partners, their parents, their children are facing as a consequence every single day.
Since Roe was overturned, I have met women who were refused care during a miscarriage — wanted to have a child, suffering a miscarriage. I met a woma- — a woman — I've actually met several who were turned away from the emergency room. One, at early stages after the Dobbs decision came down, told me with tears — she was with her husband — about how only when she developed ses- — sepsis did she receive emergency care. Only when she developed sepsis did she receive emergency care.
And now we know that at least two women — and those are only the stories we know — here in the state of Georgia died — died because of a Trump abortion ban.
One — and we heard about her story last night — a vibrant, 28-year-old young woman. She was ambitious. You know, we — I talked with her mother and her sisters about her, and they described such an extraordinary life of a person. She was excited. She was working hard. She was a medical assistant. She was going to nursing school, raising her six-year-old son.
She was really proud that she had finally worked so hard that she gained the independence. Her family was telling me that she was able to get an apartment in a gated community with a pool for her son to play in. She was so proud, and she was headed to nursing school.
And her name — and we will speak her name —
AUDIENCE: Yes.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Amber Nicole Thurman.
AUDIENCE: Amber Nicole Thurman.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Amber Nicole Thurman.
AUDIENCE: Amber Nicole Thurman.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right.
And she had her future all planned out, and it was her plan. You know, let's understand — just take pause on that for a moment. She had her plan, what she wanted to do for her son, for herself, for their future. And so, when she discovered that she was pregnant, she decided she wanted to have an abortion, but because of the Trump abortion ban here in Georgia, she was forced to travel out of state to receive the health care that she needed.
But when she returned to Georgia, she needed additional care, so she went to a hospital. But, you see, under the Trump abortion ban, her doctors could have faced up to a decade in prison for providing Amber the care she needed.
Understand what a law like this means. Doctors have to wait until the patient is at death's door before they take action.
You know, on the other side of my — you know, the — the other folks, th- — Trump and his running mate, and they'll talk about, (deepens voice) ""Oh, well, yeah, but I — you know, I — I do believe in the exception to save the mother's life."" (Laughter.) Okay. All right. Let's break that down. Shall we?
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Let's break that down. (Applause.) Let's break that down.
So, we're saying that we're going to create public policy that says that a doctor, a health care provider, will only kick in to give the care that somebody needs if they're about to die? Think about what we are saying right now. You're saying that good policy, logical policy, moral policy, humane policy, is about saying that a health care provider will only start providing that care when you're about to die?
And so, Amber waited 20 hours — 20 hours, excruciating hours — until finally she was in enough physical distress that her doctors thought they would be okay to treat her. But it was too late. She died of sepsis. And her last words to her mother — which her mother, as you know, tears up and cries every time she speaks it — last words to her mother, ""Promise me you'll take care of my son.""
So, I met last night and I spent time with Amber's mother and her sisters, and they spoke about Amber — a daughter, a sister, a mother — with the deep love that you can imagine and how terribly they miss her. And their pain is heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking.
Amber's mother, Shanette, told me that the word ""preventable"" is over and over again in her head when she learned about how her child died — the word ""preventable."" She cannot — she can't stop thinking about the word that they spoke to her. It was ""preventable.""
Because, you see, medical experts have now determined that Amber's death was preventable. And through the pain and the grief of her mother, who courageously told her story, I promised her, as she has asked, that we will make sure Amber is not just remembered as a statistic — (applause) — that she will not just be remembered as a statistic, so that people will know she was a mother and a daughter and a sister and that she was loved and that she should be alive today — (applause) — and that she should be alive today.
And many of us remember — there's so many leaders here — from two years ago when the Dobbs decision came down, we knew this could happen. There is a word ""preventable,"" and there is another word: predictable.
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And the reality is for every story we hear of the suffering under Trump abortion bans, there are so many other stories we're not hearing but where suffering is happening every day in our country, an untold number of people suffering.
Women who are also being made to feel as though they did something wrong. The judgment factor here is outrageous — being made as though to feel as though they are criminals, as though they are alone.
So, to those women, to those families, I say on behalf of what I believe we all say: We see you, and you are not alone, and we are all here standing with you. (Applause.) Standing with you. You are not alone. You are not alone. (Applause.)
So, Georgia —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We will not be silent.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We — and we will not be silent.
AUDIENCE: We will not be silent.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we will not be silent. But this is a health care crisis.
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: This is a health care crisis, and Donald Trump is the architect of this crisis. He brags about overturning Roe v. Wade. In his own words, quote, ""I did it, and I'm proud to have done it,"" he says. He is proud.
Proud that women are dying? Proud that doctors and nurses could be thrown in prison for administering care? Proud that young women today have fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers?
How dare he? How dare he?
And in our debate last week — (laughter and applause). Well, that was fun. (Laughs.)
But — and I know everyone here paid attention to the words, though — the words, right?
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) I'm trying to get another debate. We'll see. (Laughter.)
But in our debate last week, remember when he said: Everyone wanted Roe v. Wade to be overturned.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I don't know where ""everyone"" is.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, exactly. I don't know where everyone is either, because — (laughter and applause) — women have been arrested and charged for miscarriages. They didn't want that.
AUDIENCE: No!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I — I was speaking with a physician who is here, who has, in her professional experience, been administering care to girls. And what we know is that 12- and 13-year-old survivors of assault are being forced to carry a pregnancy to term. They didn't want this.
AUDIENCE: No!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And couples just trying to grow their family being cut off in the middle of IVF treatments, they didn't want this.
AUDIENCE: No!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on that last point, you probably saw, this week, for the second time, Republicans in the United States Senate blocked a bill that would protect access to IVF treatment.
Now, consider among the multitude of ironies the fact that, on the one hand, these extremists want to tell women they don't have the freedom to end an unwanted pregnancy, and on the other hand, these extremists are telling women and their partners they don't have the freedom to start a family. Okay. And they want to restrict access to contraception as well.
And now Donald Trump says that he would personally cast his vote in Florida, which is where he now lives, to support their extreme abortion ban, just like the one that is here in Georgia. And —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Felons can't vote! (Laughter and applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, that's a whole different policy discussion that we'll have for another day. (Laughter.)
But let's understand, if he is — if he is elected again as president, Donald Trump will go further. (Applause.) But we know what we're up against, and we must — we must speak of the stakes. We must remind — everybody here knows, but we got to remind our friends, our neighbors, our coworkers: The stakes are so high.
Because, if he is elected again, I am certain he will sign a national abortion ban, which would outlaw abortion in every single state. And he would create a national anti-abortion coordinator — look at Project 2025 — and force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions. It's right there.
I can't believe they put that Project 2025 in writing. (Laughter.) I — I — they — they put it — they literally put it in writing. They bound it. (Laughter.) They handed it out. I mean, they are simply out of their minds. (Laughter and applause.)
And it's clear that they just don't trust women.
AUDIENCE: They don't.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, we trust women. We trust women. (Applause.)
And like Dr. Reddick said, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedoms, as president of the United States, I will so proudly sign it back into law. (Applause.) I will so proudly sign it into law. Proudly sign it into law. (Applause.)
So, 46 days to go. And let us remember that momentum on this and so many issues — momentum is on our side. (Applause.)
Let's remember, since Roe was overturned, every time reproductive freedom has been on the ballot — from Kansas to California to Kentucky; in Michigan, Montana, Vermont, and Ohio — the people of America have voted for freedom. (Applause.) The people of America have voted for freedom — and not just by a little but by overwhelming margins, from so-called red states to so-called blue states, providing and making clear, also, this is not a partisan issue. This is not a partisan issue. And it is proving that the voice of the people has been heard and will be heard again — and will be heard again. (Applause.)
So, 46 days to go in probably the most consequential election of our lifetime.
And with that, then, today, I ask: Georgia, are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we trust women? (Applause.)
Do we believe in reproductive freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win. (Applause.)
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all for being here. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
  


  

  
    September 25, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. (Applause.) Good afternoon. Hi, everyone. (Applause.)
Good afternoon. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)
Okay. We have work to do. We have work to do. (Laughs.) Please have a seat, everyone.
Oh, it's so good to see so many friends. Thank you all, and thank you for all you have done to be so supportive. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
And thank you for all that you have done and for taking the time to be here on this Sunday afternoon. It means so much. And we have a lot of work to do, but there's a lot of work that's already happened thanks to all of you. So, thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, thank you.
And this is a room full of incredible leaders, including, of course, our governor of New York, Kathy Hochul — (applause); Leader Schumer, who has been an extraordinary partner to the president and me — (applause); members of Congress, including Representative Goldman. (Applause.) And to all the dear friends and long-standing partners here today, I thank you. I thank you.
All right. Let's level set. Everybody get — just get comfortable. (Laughs.) Let's level set. We have 44 days — 44 days. And every four years — because a lot of us have been in rooms like this every four years, if not more frequently — and we say, every four years, ""This is the one."" Well, this here is the one. This is the one. (Applause.) This is the one.
This is probably the most important election of our lifetime and probably one of the most important in the lifetime of our nation. And this election really is about two very different visions for our nation, a contrast that I think became very clear in the recent debate. (Applause.)
And, by the way, I think we should have another debate. (Applause.) I just accepted an invitation to debate in October, which my opponent seems to be looking for an excuse to avoid. But he should accept. In all seriousness, he should accept, because I feel very strongly that we owe it to the American people and to the voters to meet once more before Election Day and continue the conversation from that first debate. (Applause.)
And in that debate, you'll remember, I talked about my plans to bring down the cost of living, to invest in America's small businesses, to protect reproductive freedom, and keep our nation safe. (Applause.) But that's not what we heard from Donald Trump. Instead, it was the same old show; the same old, tired playbook that we've heard for years, with no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people.
Well, it's time to turn the page. (Applause.) It's time to turn the page. And America is ready to chart a new way forward, ready for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic — optimistic about what we can do together. (Applause.)
And I do believe that is why Democrats and Republicans and independents are supporting our campaign, because they want a president who works for all the American people, and that is the kind of president I pledge to you that I will be.
I have, my entire career, fought for the people. As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, California, I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them. As attorney general of California, I defended communities that were being poisoned by polluters and Big Oil. I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for-profit colleges, for workers who were being cheated out of the wages they were due, for seniors facing elder abuse.
And as president, I will fight on behalf of all Americans. And I know that, together, we can and we must build a brighter future for our nation, a future where we build what I called an ""opportunity economy"" — an economy where everyone can compete and everyone has a real chance to succeed; where middle-class families have security and stability; and all Americans, regardless of who they are or where they start, can build wealth for themselves and their children.
To build that opportunity economy, I will bring together labor, small business, founders, and innovators in major companies. We will partner together to invest in America's competitiveness, to invest in America's future. We will encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while protecting consumers and investors. We will create a stable business environment with consistent and transparent rules of the road. We will invest in semiconductors, clean energy, and other industries of the future. And we will cut needless bureaucracy and unnecessary red tape, all of which will create jobs, drive broad-based economic growth, and cement America's leadership throughout the world. (Applause.)
The way I see it, this is motivated and designed in large part knowing that the vast majority of Americans don't want to just be able to get by. They want to get ahead. They want to get ahead. They want to be able to own a home, build wealth, start a business.
And so, I'll tell you a little bit more about some specific plans I have — and, again, in contrast to my opponent, who offers very little. (Laughter.)
So, for example, I'll tell you I love our small businesses. I love small businesses. (Applause.) I really do. And maybe it's because, growing up — and my sister Maya is here — (applause) — you know, when we were growing up — she's somewhere, usually in the back of the room. There she is.
Well, when we were growing up, we lived in an apartment above a childcare center, and that childcare center was owned by Mrs. Shelton, who lived two doors down from us. And Mrs. Shelton helped my mother raise us. When my mother worked long days and worked on the weekends, Mrs. Shelton helped raise us to the point that Maya and I have always called Mrs. Shelton our ""second mother.""
Well, Mrs. Shelton was a small-business owner, and I will tell you that I learned from childhood the character of a small-business owner. She was a matriarch of the community. She mentored. She hired locally. She was part of the civic fabric. And in addition, then, to being a business leader, she was a civic leader.
And when I travel our country — and I have been traveling our country a lot recently, but — but for the last four years, I meet our small-business owners, and they are literally — and I think we would all know this — small businesses are the backbone of America's economy. They really are. (Applause.)
So, my plan includes giving a $50,000 tax deduction to start up small businesses. (Applause.) Because here's the deal. Right now, the tax deduction for start-ups is $5,000. Nobody can start a small business on that. If we really mean that we want to fuel the innovation, if we want to reward the ambition, we got to do better.
We also need to build more housing in America. (Applause.) And so, when I referred earlier to part of how I think about things, it includes cutting the red tape. And on the issue of building more housing, working with the private sector so that, by the end of my first term, we can build 3 million new homes. (Applause.)
Part of my plan includes lowering the cost of living for America's middle-class families. Because look, I grew up a middle-class kid, and I will never forget where I came from. And I have a plan, then, to bring down costs on everything from health care to groceries, because it's a real impediment to people's ability to get ahead, and we've got to bring down those costs.
Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut, including $6,000 during the first year of a child's life. (Applause.) Because, look, new parents, wherever they are, whoever they are, have a natural desire to parent their children well but not always the resources that are necessary to do that. And it is in our collective benefit to be able to help them, especially when you're talking about such a fundamental phase of their child's development.
So, that $6,000, that's going to include giving them support to buy a car seat, to buy a crib, to just take care of those basic necessities at a critical time.
All of that to say: Donald Trump has a very different plan based on a very different vision of who we are and the needs of the American people. And I've said this before, and I'll say it again: In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man, but the consequences of putting him back in the White House are extremely serious — extremely serious. (Applause.)
Look, for example, at Project 2025. And, you know, honestly, I just have to keep saying this. I can't believe they put that thing in writing. (Laughter.) I mean, they didn't just put it in writing. They — they bound it and — and handed it out. And, you know, if you can't sleep one night, google it.
Because — because here's the thing. It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if elected president again. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare; to repeal our climate investments and send thousands of good-paying clean energy jobs overseas; and he wants to impose what I call a ""Trump sales tax,"" a 20 percent tax on everyday basic necessities, which will cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year.
And top economists have reviewed our plans. Goldman Sachs says my plan would grow our economy and that his plan would shrink it. Sixteen Nobel Prize-winning economists have said he would reignite inflation. Moody's assessed he would ignite a recession by the middle of next year.
On top of all of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act. And as he said in the debate, he has — I'm going to quote now — (laughter) — ""concepts of a plan."" (Laughter and applause.) ""Concepts"" to replace it.
In all seriousness, think about this. So, he's going to threaten the health insurance of 45 million people based on a concept. Serious consequences we're talking about.
And if he were to do that, it would take us back to when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. Remember what that was like — for so many people in our country what that meant, not having access to the health care they need?
So, I will say, then, what I say everywhere I go and when I'm in those rooms — those very big rooms with a lot of people — yeah — (laughter and applause). I couldn't help myself.
But what I say there and — and folks will repeat: We are not going back. (Applause.) We are not going back. We are not going back. Because, as much of anything, our fight is a fight for the future. Our fight is a fight for the future.
I was saying to some folks I was talking with earlier: We're not fighting against something; we're fighting for something. And ours is a fight for the future. (Applause.)
And ours is a fight for freedom — (applause) — because you all know — and as I travel the country it becomes increasingly clear to me — there is a full-on attack afoot against hard-fought, hard-won, fundamental freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote.
The — in Georgia — right? — passed a law that basically makes it illegal to give people food and water for standing in line to vote. Think about that. The hypocrisy abounds. Whatever happened to ""love thy neighbor""?
Attacks on the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.)
And on that point, y- — many will remember: I was one of the first electeds in the country — it was Valentine's weekend of 2004 — to perform same-sex marriages. Twenty — (applause). So, this last February, we just celebrated the 20th anniversary of that.
But think about this. Think about this. It pains my heart when I think about that and think about something like in Florida and a ""Don't Say Gay"" law and what that means, because, if you think about it, among the people directly impacted are teachers. And think about that young teacher who is probably in their 20s who is afraid to put up a photograph of themselves and their partner for fear they could be fired. For doing what job? God's work — teaching other people's children.
So, this is real, what we're looking at, in terms of these attacks on fundamental freedoms and rights. And, of course, front of mind for so many is the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
And on that point, let's always remember and remind folks of how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court — the court of Thurgood and RBG — with the intention that they would overturn the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended.
And now more than 20 states have a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral. (Applause.) It is immoral to tell a survivor of a crime of violence to their body, of violation of their body, that they don't have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. It's immoral.
And as I travel the country, most people agree: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body. (Applause.) Not the government.
Elections matter. Elections matter.
And I'll tell you, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly sign it into law.
So, so much is at stake and on the line in this election. And this is not 2016 or 2020. It's not '16 or '20, because — for many reasons, including what happened a couple of months ago when the Supreme Court — the United States Supreme Court basically told the former president that he is effectively immune for whatever he does when he's in the White House.
Now, think about that. So, at least before that ruling, there was the appearance or the threat of consequence, but now there is essentially explicit authority to do whatever he wants.
And let's put this ruling, then — this decision in context. This is a man who has vowed that he will be a dictator on day one. He has said he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. He has called for, and I'm going to quote, the ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States. So, just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails.
So, all this to say: Forty-four days. And we're all here together, and you all have taken the time out of your busy lives, because we know what is at stake. And we are all here together because we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country. We love our country.
And I do believe that it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight for us to realize the promise of America.
So, 44 days. And early voting has already started in some states. So, essentially, the election is here, right? And this race — and I cannot emphasize this enough — this race is as close as it could be. It's as close as it could be. This is a margin-of-error race. I know we've got a lot of enthusiasm and excitement about all that is possible. This is a margin-of-error race.
And I'm running — and we are running — as the underdog in this race. Our campaign is doing the work we need to do on the airwaves, on voter education in every county of every battleground state. And we are leading in many ways in terms of what we are committed to doing to build up that grassroots and community-based leadership. And in the process of all of that, we are leaving it all on the field.
And your support, as you know, which is why you've been so generous — your support is absolutely critical to the work we have in front of us. The leaders in this room have done so much already, and I'm going to ask for a bit more. (Laughter.)
So, here's what I'm asking for. The leaders here are part of large networks. Everyone here is part of many large networks in which you are an opinion leader. I need you to activate those networks — to tell your friends, your colleagues, your neighbors about the stakes. Tell them how close this race is, and let them know why you support our campaign.
And let them know we need their help also in the next 44 days. And we need their help to please join our team in battleground states and help folks register to vote and get them to the polls; to sign up to make phone calls, to do that kind of work that really is so fundamentally important that's about that human interaction that I think so many people are really craving to remind us that we're all in this together.
And I'll say this. In this campaign, let's also be intentional about building community and building coalitions and bringing folks together, because I do believe that the work we are doing right now — yes, our first imperative is to win, but it is also to build — to build community and coalitions and to remind people that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. I think there's a hunger for that right now in our country. (Applause.)
So, all that to say: This is a fight for our freedom and our future, and the baton is in our hands. It's in our hands. (Applause.)
And so, I'll end by saying what I say at every rally.
When we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)
Thank you, all. Thank you, all. Thank you. (Applause.)

    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. Hi, everyone. Hi. Good afternoon. (Applause.)
Can we please applaud Theresa and her extraordinary courage? Please, can we applaud her extraordinary courage? (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Please have a seat, everyone. Thank you. It's good to be back in Arizona. (Applause.) It is good to be back in Arizona.
Thank you all. Thank you so very much. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. I appreciate — thank you so very much.
I — I just want to, for a moment, speak about Theresa. We — we had some time together backstage. And, you know, I think that in moments of crisis, such as the fentanyl crisis, there are people who, through their suffering and their pain, rise with courage in such a selfless way to be a voice for others with the anticipation and the hope and the hard work of hoping that their story will be the reason other people don't have that story.
And you sharing your story about Jacob and your advocacy on why we have to stop this scourge is so incredibly important. And, again, I applaud Theresa, and I know we all do. (Applause.) And our need to stop this issue is one of the reasons that we are all here together today.
I also want to thank the extraordinary elected officials who are here.
Senator Mark Kelly, who came with me. (Applause.) He had — and his extraordinary wife, Gabby Giffords, traveled with me from Washington, D.C. to be here. And Senator Kelly has been talking with me for quite some time about the importance of this visit. And so, I thank you in front of all of our friends for your work. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Attorney General Kris Mayes, who just tore up the floor up. (Applause.) She is, you know, one of — well, I'm going to talk a bit about it in a minute, but some of the work that — that I have done in my career as attorney general and watching her do the work that she has done as attorney general really does emphasize the importance of having the right leader at the right time in the right place, and that's who she is. (Applause.)
Mayor Huish, I thank you for the warm welcome. We've spent some time together. You've shared with me the needs of your community. (Applause.) And I thank you for your leadership as well.
And to all the elected and community leaders here today, thank you for taking the time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon.
Before I begin, I do want to say a few words about Hurricane Helene. I spoke this morning with our FEMA Administrator Criswell, and President Biden and I, of course, will continue to monitor the situation closely.
We have mobilized more than 1,500 federal personnel to support those communities that have been impacted. We have food, water, and generators that are ready for deployment, and — (applause) — we are working to restore power for — for millions of people who currently are experiencing outages.
And I just want to stress — and for the — the press that is here, to those who are watching — the storm continues to be dangerous and deadly, and lives have been lost, and the risk of flooding still remains high. So, I continue to urge everyone to please continue to follow guidance from your local officials until we get past this moment. So, thank you all.
And — and now I'll speak about, in particular, the people who are here today and why we are gathered here together today.
So, Arizona, I think you all know, and this is why you are here, there are consequential issues at stake in this election, and one is the security of our border.
The United States is a sovereign nation, and I believe we have a duty to set rules at our border and to enforce them, and I take that responsibility very seriously.
We are also a nation of immigrants. The United States has been enriched by generations of people who have come from every corner of the world to contribute to our country and to become part of the American story, and so we must reform our immigration system to ensure that it works in an orderly way, that it is humane, and that it makes our country stronger. (Applause.)
So, I've just come from visiting the border and the port of entry in Douglas. I spoke with dedicated agents from Border Patrol and Customs officers who every day see the overflow of commercial traffic through the port. These men and women who work there and at other places along our southern border help keep our nation secure, and they need more resources to do their jobs, which is why we have and are in the process of investing half a billion dollars to modernize and expand the port of entry here in Douglas — (applause) — and why last December I helped raise the rate of overtime pay for border agents — (applause) — and also why I strongly supported the comprehensive border security bill written last year — written last year, as you know, by a bipartisan group of senators, including one of the most conservative members of the United States Congress.
That bill would have hired 1,500 more border agents and officers. It would have paid for 100 inspection machines to detect fentanyl that is killing tens of thousands of Americans every year. It would have allowed us to more quickly and effectively remove those who come here illegally. And it would have increased the number of immigration judges and asylum officers.
It was the strongest border security bill we have seen in decades. It was endorsed by the Border Patrol union, and it should be in effect today, producing results in real time right now for our country. (Applause.)
But Donald Trump tanked it. He picked up the phone and called some friends in Congress and said, ""Stop the bill."" Because, you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. (Applause.) And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games and their personal political future. (Applause.)
And so, even though Donald Trump tried to sabotage the border security bill, it is my pledge to you that as president of the United States, I will bring it back up and proudly sign it into law. (Applause.)
And let me say, the issue of border security is not a new issue to me. I was attorney general of a border state for two terms. I saw the violence and chaos that transnational criminal organizations cause and the heartbreak and loss from the spread of their illicit drugs.
I walked through tunnels that traffickers used to smuggle contraband into the United States. I've seen tunnels with walls as smooth as the walls of your living room, complete with lighting and air conditioning, making very clear that it is about an enterprise that is making a whole lot of money in the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings.
And my knowledge on how they work comes from the fact that I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs and human beings.
My team and I broke up a heroin trafficking ring in the Bay Area with ties to Mexican cartels. We took down a gang working with the Sinaloa Cartel to traffic methamphetamine into the United States. We seized millions of dollars' worth of cocaine from the Guadalajara cortel — Cartel and broke up a drun- — a drug trafficking operation, including pill mills and so-called recovery centers that were pushing opioids with deadly results.
As attorney general of California, it was 10 years ago that I brought a bipartisan group of American attorneys general and led that group to travel to Mexico City to meet with Mexican attorneys general to address this issue and, in particular, to increase intelligence sharing on gang activity. All of which allowed us to prosecute more human traffickers.
And I started, as attorney general, the first comprehensive report in the state of California analyzing transnational criminal organizations and the threats they pose to public safety and to the economy.
So, stopping transnational criminal organizations and strengthening our border is not new to me, and it is a long-standing priority of mine. I have done that work, and I will continue to treat it as a priority when I am elected president of the United States. (Applause.)
And it is my pledge to you, understanding how solutions get formed, that I will reach across the aisle and I will embrace commonsense approaches and new technologies to get the job done, because I know transnational gangs coming across the border, trafficking in guns, drugs, and human beings, could care less who somebody voted for in the last election. (Applause.) They could care less.
They've got one goal in mind, and it is therefore critically important that anybody who calls themselves a leader would work with other leaders for commonsense solutions, understanding the pain and the suffering that Americans are experiencing if we don't work together to fix these problems.
And look, I — transnational gangs, one of the things I know about them, they are always innovating. So, to disrupt them, we must do the same, and that means, again, working together in real time, grounded on finding commonsense approaches, not just about some rhetoric at a rally but actually doing the work of fixing a problem. (Applause.)
And as president, I won't only bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump tanked; I will do more to secure our border.
To reduce illegal border crossings, I will take further action to keep the border closed between ports of entry. Those who cross our borders unlawfully will be apprehended and removed and barred from reentering for five years. We will pursue more severe criminal charges against repeat violators. And if someone does not make an asylum request at a legal point of entry and instead crosses our border unlawfully, they will be barred from receiving asylum.
While we understand that many people are desperate to migrate to the United States, our system must be orderly and secure, and that is my goal. (Applause.) And that is my goal.
Securing our border also means addressing the flow of fentanyl into our communities. Fentanyl is a scourge on our country. The nature of it as a drug is such that it is highly addictive and it is highly lethal, so much so that using it one time only can be fatal. I have met far too many families, parents, loved ones who have lost a family member, a child to fentanyl, and their grief is heartbreaking.
And the devastation caused by fentanyl is being felt from rural communities to big cities. It's impacting communities across our country, regardless of where they are geographically, politically, or any other demographic you cl- — you choose to talk about. It's a scourge in our country, and we have to take it seriously. And as president, I will make it a top priority to disrupt the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States. (Applause.)
And I know everyone here understands that most of the fentanyl in America comes from two cartels based in Mexico. Most often, they are smuggling it through vehicles at legal ports of entry, like the one I visited today.
The fact is, border officers don't have enough resources and are only able to search a fraction of the vehicles that pass through their checkpoints. This is unacceptable. They need the resources to do their jobs. And as we could have done with that border security bill, I will surge support to law enforcement agencies on the front lines — more personnel, more training, and more technology, including 100 new inspection systems that can detect fentanyl hidden in vehicles. And we will make sure that our ports of entry, including airports and seaports, have additional state-of-the-art technology to detect fentanyl and the chemical tools used to make it.
I will also double the resources for the Department of Justice to extradite and prosecute transnational criminal organizations and the cartels. (Applause.) Yes.
I will ensure that we target the entire global fentanyl supply chain, because we must materially and sustainably disrupt the flow of illicit fentanyl coming into our country.
My approach takes into account also that the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl are by and large made in China and then shipped to Mexican cartels and trafficked right here into the United States.
Our administration demanded that China crack down on the companies that make those chemicals, and it has started to happen, but they need to do more. And as president, I will hold them to their commitment to significantly reduce the flow of precursor chemicals coming from China. (Applause.) Yeah.
And all of this to say, we must tackle this issue from every angle, because our highest charge must be to protect the lives of our people. It must be to understand the pain and to have the courage to know that the solutions are at hand if we focus on fixing a problem instead of running on a problem. (Applause.)
And on this issue, writ large, we must ensure that our country remains strong and competitive, which includes fixing our broken immigration system. (Applause.)
And let me be clear, I reject the false choice — I reject the false choice that suggests we must either choose between securing our border or creating a system of immigration that is safe, orderly, and humane. We can and we must do both. (Applause.) We must do both.
And we need clear, legal pathways for people seeking to come into our country — (applause) — and we must make our current system work better.
For example, it can take years for asylum claims to be decided. Well, this is a problem we can solve, including by hiring more asylum officers and expanding processing centers in people's home countries. (Applause.) And as president, I will work with Congress to create, at long last, a pathway to citizenship for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years — (applause) — for years and deserve to have a system that works.
I also have in mind our DREAMers. I have met — (applause) — I have met with so many of our DREAMers throughout my career. They who have grown up in the United States, were educated here, pay taxes here, serve in our military, and contribute to our communities every day. They are American in every way, but still, they do not have an earned pathway to citizenship. And this problem has gone unsolved, at this point now, for decades.
The same goes for farm workers who ensure that we have food on our tables — (applause) — and who sustain our agricultural industry, and they, too, have been in legal limbo for years because politicians have refused to come together to fix our broken immigration system.
Well, as president, I will put politics aside to fix our immigration system and find solutions — solutions to problems which have persisted for far too long. (Applause.) For far too long, we have all known this is not working as it can and as it should.
And so, as I said at the beginning, these issues are highly consequential for our nation, and the contrast in this election is clear. It is a choice between commonsense solutions and the same old political games.
In the four years that Donald Trump was president, he did nothing to fix our broken immigration system. He did not solve the shortage of immigration judges. He did not solve the shortage of border agents. He did not create lawful pathways into our nation. He did nothing to address an outdated asylum system and did not work with other governments in our hemisphere to deal with what clearly is also a regional challenge. (Applause.)
As overdoses went up during his presidency, he fought to slash funding for the fight against fentanyl. And what did he do instead? Well, let's talk about that. He separated families. He ripped toddlers out of their mother's arms, put children in cages, and tried to end protections for DREAMers.
He made the challenges at the border worse. And he is still — and he is still fanning the flames of fear and division.
And let me be clear, that is not the work of a leader. That is not the work of a leader, and that is, in fact, I think we all believe, an abdication of leadership. (Applause.)
And so, on behalf of all across our nation who want to see these problems solved, I say we cannot accept Donald Trump's failure to lead. We should not permit scapegoating instead of solutions.
And let's see what's happening. Let's not permit scapegoating instead of solutions or rhetoric instead of results.
As your president, I will protect our nation's sovereignty, secure our border, and work to fix our broken — broken system of immigration, and I will partner with Democrats, Republicans and independents to do it. (Applause.)
Arizona, it is time for us to turn the page on the ugly battles that have characterized our politics, and it is time to move forward together to achieve real solutions that make our country stronger.
And I know we can get this done. I know we have the will. I know we have the courage. I know the solutions are at hand, and I know we are ready. (Applause.)
And so, with all of that, I say, thank you.
May God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. (Applause.) Thank you all.

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Las Vegas, Nevada
  


  

  
    September 29, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hey, Las Vegas. (Applause.)
Good evening, Nevada. (Applause.) Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. (Applause.) (Inaudible.)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)
Thank you all. Thank you, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)
And can we please hear it for Captain Quintero? (Applause.)
Oh, thank you all. Thank you, everyone. Oh, it is so wonderful to be back in Nevada. Thank you all. Thank you. (Applause.)
And happy Hispanic Heritage Month to everyone. (Applause.)
Thank you. Thank you all. It's good to be back, and I want to thank everyone for all that you do.
I know we have some extraordinary elected leaders here, and I want to thank them for their incredible work and friendship. It is good to be with all the leaders who are here, including Representative Susie Lee, who is here — (applause); Steven Horsford — (applause); Dina Titus — (applause); the great General Ford — (applause); Senator Catherine Cortez Masto — (applause); Senator Jacky Rosen, who we're going to send back to the United States Senate. (Applause.)
Thank you, everyone, and all the local leaders here. There are so many leaders here. It is good to be back with you. (Applause.)
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
And wait a minute. We also tonight have here some of the Vegas Raiders, who won their game tonight. (Applause.) Thank you. Congratulations. Oh, congratulations. You came right from the game. Congratulations.
Give them an applause, right? (Applause.) Well done. Well done. Well done.
So, in all seriousness, everyone, before I begin, I want to say a few words about Hurricane Helene. And please have a seat if you're able.
I want to talk about Hurricane Helene for a moment, and I know that everyone here sends their thoughts and prayers for the folks who have been so devastated by that hurricane and the ensuing events in Florida, in Georgia, the Carolinas, and other impacted states. And we know that so many have been impacted; some have died.
But I want to thank everyone for doing everything you can to think about them. Send them your thoughts. Send them your prayers.
I want to thank the first responders who have done so much. (Applause.)
And we will stand with these communities for as long as it takes to make sure that they are able to recover and rebuild.
Earlier today, I received an operational briefing from FEMA Director Criswell. More than 3,300 federal personnel have been mobilized. We are deploying food, water, and generators and working to restore water and power. (Applause.)
And the president and I have told state and local leaders we will provide whatever help they need in the days and weeks ahead.
And so, I thank you all for sending your best wishes to everyone there. Thank you. (Applause.)
So, Las Vegas, we have 37 days until the election. (Applause.) Thirty-seven days. And we know this will be a tight race until the very end.
And let's level set. We are the underdog. We are the underdog, and we have some hard work ahead.
But here's the thing. We like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. (Applause.)
And with your help, we will win in November. (Applause.) Yes, we will. Yes, we will. Yes, we will.
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We will win.
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We will win.
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We will win.
And here's why — and here's why — and here's why: Because we here know that this election is about two very different visions for our nation. And the contrast, I think, was quite clear in our debate.
Did you all see the debate? (Applause.) You saw — you saw the debate. You saw the debate. Yeah, yeah.
And in two days, I know we will cheer on Coach Walz when he debates J.D. Vance. (Applause.) Yeah.
But listen, also, their debate should not be the last word. I'm trying to debate Donald Trump again and — (applause) — I think he should debate again. The American people have a right to hear us discuss the issues. And as you say here in Las Vegas, I'm all in. I'm all in — (applause) — even if my opponent is ready to fold, so there you go.
But you will remember, in our first debate, I talked about issues like bringing down the cost of living, investing in small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom — (applause) — and keeping our nation secure. (Applause.)
But from Donald Trump, well, it was the same old, tired playbook — same old, tired playbook — with no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people.
Well, folks, it's time to turn the page. (Applause.) It's time to turn the page.
America is ready to chart a new way forward — (applause) — ready for a new and optimistic generation of leadership — (applause) — which is why Democrats, Republicans, and independents are supporting our campaign, because we know we need a president who works for all the American people. (Applause.)
Enough of the division. Enough of the hate. We are all in this together. (Applause.)
And you all know, for my entire career, I've only had one client: the people. The people. (Applause.)
From being a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, I stood up for women and children against predators. (Applause.) As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks — (applause) — and delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure. (Applause.) I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by for-profit colleges — (applause) — for workers who were being cheated out of their wages. (Applause.)
And I pledge to you, as president, I will fight for all Americans. And together, we will build a brighter future for our nation. (Applause.)
We will build a future that includes thinking about our economy in a way that it is about lifting everyone up. We will build what I call an ""opportunity economy"" so that every American has an opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business. (Applause.)
And let me tell you, I love our small businesses, of which I've met so many right here in Vegas. (Applause.)
You know, growing up, our mother worked very long hours, and so, my sister Maya and I would go over two doors down to Ms. Shelton's house. She — we called her our second mother. And Ms. Shelton was a small-business owner. So, I know, since I was a young child, who our small businesses are, who our small-business owners are.
Small businesses are the backbone of America's economy. (Applause.) I know that. I know that. And Latina small-business owners are the fastest growing segment of our economy. (Applause.)
So, my plan is about tapping into that ambition, those aspirations, those dreams, those incredible ideas, that strong work ethic that people have, also understanding not everybody gets handed $4 million on a silver platter and files for bankruptcy six times.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, my plan is about saying we've got to help entrepreneurs, startups out, and I will give a $50,000 tax deduction to help entrepreneurs start their small businesses. (Applause.) Because right now, that tax deduction is $5,000. Can't nobody start a small business in 2024. So, we're going — we are going to make it something what — where it is doable to lift folks up.
We also need to build more housing in America. (Applause.) My mother saved up for years, until I was a teenager, when she was able to buy our first home. And right now, a serious housing shortage is part of what is driving up cost. So, we will cut the red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes — (applause) — and provide first-time home buyers with $25,000 down-payment assistance — (applause) — so you can just get your foot in the door. You'll do the rest.
And we must lower the cost of living, because while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it, and I know it.
So, I have a plan that includes lowering costs on everything from health care to groceries, including I will take on the corporate price gouging that we know — (applause) — has resulted in jacking prices up, often around tragedies and emergencies.
We will give a tax cut to 100 million more Americans, including $6,000 during the first year of a child's life — (applause) — knowing that the vast majority of our young parents have a natural desire to parent their children well but not always the resources to do it. And that $6,000 in extending and expanding the Child Tax Credit will help buying a crib, buying a car seat, doing the things that are so critical in that first phase of life.
I will also make sure good-paying jobs are available to all Americans, not only those with college degrees. (Applause.) Because we need to recognize the value of additional paths, such as apprenticeships and technical programs. (Applause.) And so, as president, part of how I'm going to push this forward is I will get rid of unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs — (applause) — understanding that having a college degree is not the only measure of the skills and experience of a worker. (Applause.) And when we do that with the federal workforce, I'm coming to ask the private sector — challenge you to do the same. (Applause.)
So, all of this is to say I will always put the middle class and working families first. I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. (Applause.) Never.
Now, Donald Trump has a different plan.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Just google ""Project 2025.""
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Which, I have to say, I still can't believe they put that thing in writing. (Laughter.) They printed it up. They bound it. They handed it out. Just google it. It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he would do if he were elected again as president.
Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts again —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — cut Social Security and Medicare —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and impose what I call a ""Trump sales tax,"" which would be a 20 percent tax on everyday basic necessities —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — which economists have measured would cost the average family nearly 4,000 more dollars a year in everyday expenses.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on top of all this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he has no plan to replace it.
He has, quote, ""concepts of a plan."" (Applause.) ""Concepts.""
So, here's the thing, though. We can laugh about many things, but the consequences of this are quite serious — quite serious. Because think about it: He's going to threaten health coverage and health insurance for 45 million people in our country based on a concept and take us back to when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was like?
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, we are not going back. (Applause.) We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We — we will move forward and — (applause) — and we will take on the biggest issues facing our nation.
We have talked about the economy. We have talked about what we can do in terms of investing in the ambition, the aspirations of our country. We will take on the issue of immigration. We will take on a number of issues.
On the subject of immigration, we must have comprehensive immigration reform — (applause) — with strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship — (applause) — including for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years, including our DREAMers — (applause) — including our DREAMers.
And I was attorney general of a border state. I prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs, and human beings. And as president, I will double the resources for the Department of Justice to go after those transnational cartels — (applause) — and take action to stop the flow of fentanyl coming into our country, which is destroying entire communities. (Applause.)
These are serious problems, and we know Donald Trump won't solve them.
When he was president, he did nothing to fix our immigration system. (Applause.) And earlier this year, we had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan border security bill in decades, and Donald Trump tanked the bill because he thought that that bill, if passed, would have hurt him, and he'd prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. That's not the kind of president we want.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: As president, he cruelly separated families and plans to do it again.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he continues to fan the flames of fear and division.
Look, we need a president who cares more about solving problems than playing political games and demeaning people full
time. (Applause.) We're tired of that. We're — we're done with that.
So, Nevada, ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom — (applause) — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
And we remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court — the court of Thurgood and RBG —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — so that they would do as they did and overturn the protections of Roe v. Wade. And now one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest. It is immoral. Immoral.
And let us agree, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn't be telling her what to do. (Applause.) If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government telling her what to do with her body. (Applause.) Come on.
And with Jacky Rosen back in the United States Senate — (applause) — when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly sign it into law.
And, Nevada, you know I'm traveling all over our country. Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote, the freedom to join a union, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride — (applause) — and the freedom to be safe from gun violence — (applause) — which after 1 October Nevada proved that smart gun safety laws are just common sense. (Applause.)
So, look, generations before us, generations of America led the fight for freedom, and the baton — well, it's now in our hands. It's now in our hands. (Applause.)
And it all comes down to this. We are here together. You came out on a Sunday evening. We are here together because we know what is at stake, and we are here together because we love our country. We love our country. We love our country. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. That's right.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I do believe — I do believe that one of the highest forms of patriotism that we could show is to then fight for the ideals of our country. That's what this is about. It is a fight to realize the promise of America. (Applause.)
And I know the people of Nevada; you are Battle Born. You are Battle Born. (Applause.) Yes, you are. And we are all ready for the work ahead. Thirty-seven days. (Applause.) Thirty-seven days.
And here in Nevada, every voter will receive a ballot in the mail, and in-person early voting starts October 19th. (Applause.)
So, now is the time to make your plan for how you are going to vote. Okay? And I'd ask you to start making your plan now for how you are going to vote. And if you choose to vote by mail, do not wait. Fill out your battl- — ballot, sign it, and send it back right away. (Applause.) Okay? And tell your neighbors.
Because, folks, the election is here — (applause) — and we need to energize and organize and mobilize. And remember, your vote is your voice. Your voice is your power. Don't ever let anybody take your power from you. Never. (Applause.) Never. Don't let anybody silence you ever.
So, Las Vegas, today, I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. God bless you. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Ripon, Wisconsin
  


  

  
    October 03, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Can we hear it for Liz Cheney? (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Liz! Thank you, Liz! Thank you, Liz!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It is so good to be back in Wisconsin. (Applause.) I thank you, everyone, for being — please have a seat. I thank you all for being here. But I just — I have to emphasize that every time I come here and — and, Liz, I was actually a kid here, too, when my parents were at the University of Wisconsin. (Laughs.) So, we have that in common as well.
In fact, Tony Evers always says when I land, ""Welcome home."" (Laughter.) But I — I say all that to say every time that I've come here recently, one of the conversations that we have, all of us together, is how much we love our country and that that really is the binding factor in us all being together and taking the time to be together, to really just renew and remind everyone of what is at stake, but borne out of love that we have this fight. (Applause.)
And I want to thank you, Liz Cheney, for reminding us that that, regardless of party affiliation, is a factor that binds us all. And so, I thank you for your support and your leadership and your courage. (Applause.)
I also want to thank all the other great leaders who are with us today. Governor Tony Evers — (applause) — where is he? There you are. Thank you.
Mayor Grant, thank you for the warm welcome. (Applause.)
I want to thank Senator Tammy Baldwin, who is traveling around the state — (applause) — but who I know you will reelect in November. (Applause.)
Thank you, Sheriff Michek, for your support and your life of service to the people of Iowa County. (Applause.)
And so, I — I do want to say a bit more about Liz Cheney. You all know her leadership, and she has obviously, and so importantly, been a leader for the people of Wyoming, but she has also been an extraordinary national leader and has served with great honor. (Applause.)
And she not only, as she has talked today, recognizes that character is among the most important attributes of leadership, but she also personifies that attribute. And she possesses some of the qualities of character that I most respect in any individual and any leader: courage, especially at a moment like this, where there are so many powerful forces that have been intent on trying to demean and belittle and make people afraid.
And there are many who know it is wrong, and then there are those who have the courage to speak out loudly about it and the conviction to speak truth. And, you know, it is so admirable when anyone does it, and especially when it is difficult to do in an environment such as this. But Liz Cheney really is a leader who puts country above party and above self, a true patriot — (applause) — and it is my profound honor — my profound honor to have your support. (Applause.)
And I also want to thank your father, Vice President Dick Cheney, for his support and — (applause) — and what he has done to serve our country.
Every endorsement matters, and this endorsement matters a great deal, Liz. And it carries the spicals — special significance, because, as you said, we may not see eye to eye on every issue, and we are going to get back to a healthy two-party system — I am sure of that — where we will have vigorous debates. (Applause.)
And as you said, you may not have — have supported a Democrat for president before, but as you have also said, we both love our country, and we revere our democratic ideals. And we both also believe in the nobility of public service, and we know that our oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America is a sacred oath — an oath that must be honored and must never be violated. (Applause.)
And your words today and the reason we are all here today, I think, really do underscore perhaps one of the most fundamental questions that is facing the American people in this election: Who will obey that oath? Who will abide by the oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States of America? (Applause.)
I have had the privilege — (laughs).
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
And I have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution six times in my career, including as vice president, as a United States senator, and as the top law enforcement officer of the largest state in our country
(Applause.) Responsible for upholding and enforcing the laws of the state and the laws of the United States was the work I did. And I have never wavered in upholding that oath, and I have always executed it faithfully and without reservation. (Applause.)
And therein lies the profound difference between Donald Trump and me.
He, who violated the oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America. And make no mistake: He, who if given the chance, would violate it again.
Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. (Applause.) And as you have heard and know, he refused to accept the will of the people and the results of an election that was free and fair.
As you have heard, he sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol, where they assaulted law enforcement officers. He threatened the life of his own vice president and refused to engage in the peaceful transfer of power.
And let us be clear about how he intends to use power if elected again. He has called for jailing journalists, political opponents, anyone he sees and deems as being an enemy. He has pledged to destroy the independence of the Department of Justice, and he called for deploying our active-duty military against our own citizens.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Kristallnacht! Weird!
AUDIENCE MEMBER: He's weird!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: W- — I — well, I believe —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We're not going back!
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You and my running mate both. (Laughing.)
Well, listen, I believe that anyone who recklessly tramples on our democratic values, as Donald Trump has; anyone who has actively and violently obstructed the will of the people and the peaceful transfer of power, as Donald Trump has; anyone who has called for, I quote, ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States, as Donald Trump has, must never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. (Applause.)
Never again. Never again. (Applause.)
And the tragic truth — the tragic truth that we are facing in this election for president of the United States is that there is actually an honest question about whether one of the candidates will uphold the oath to the Constitution of the United States. That is the tragic truth of this election, that this is actually an honest question that we are having as Americans.
And I know the vast majority of us agree that upholding the Constitution must be a basic requirement we expect of anyone seeking the highest office in the land. I know the vast majority of us, regardless of your political party, agree we must hold sacred America's fundamental principles — from the rule of law, to free and fair elections, to the peaceful transfer of power. (Applause.)
And if you share — if you share that view, no matter your political party, there is a place for you with us and in this campaign, because those principles, I know, unite us across party lines. And in this election, I take seriously my pledge to be a president for all Americans.
My entire career — (applause) — my entire career, I've only had one client: the people. (Applause.) And when I say that — and when I say that I mean all the people, not just those who share my party affiliation.
Through all my decades in law enforcement, I never asked a victim or a witness, ""Are you a Republican or a Democrat?"" The only question I ever asked was, ""Are you okay?"" And that is the kind of president we deserve, and I pledge to you that is the kind of president I will be. (Applause.)
Because the president of the United States must not look at our country through the narrow lens of ideology or petty partisanship or self-interest. The president of the United States must not look at our country as an instrument for their own ambitions.
Our nation is not some spoil to be won. The United States of America is the greatest idea humanity ever devised — the nation that inspired the world to believe in the possibilities of a representative government. And so, in the face of those who would endanger our magnificent experiment, people of every party must stand together.
And let me be clear: Democracy and freedom are not only at stake here at home; they are also at stake around the world. As president of the United States, I will strengthen, not abdicate America's global leadership. (Applause.)
Last week, I met with Ukraine's President Zelenskyy — (applause) — and the message I delivered was the same message I've shared with him every time I've seen him: I stand with Ukraine, and I always will. (Applause.)
And I told him, as I have before, I want Ukraine to prevail. By contrast, in our debate, Donald Trump couldn't even bring himself to say he wanted Ukraine to win the war — couldn't even bring himself to say that.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: A war that Putin, a brutal dictator, launched against a free and independent people. Trump wants to force Ukraine to give up its sovereign territory, a bedrock principle upon which we stand and fight for. And you know who else wants them to give up their sovereign —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Putin!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — absolutely — territory. (Laughter.) Putin. Putin. And that's not a plan for peace. It's a plan for surrender.
Well, I believe that in the global struggle between tyranny and democracy, the president of the United States must always be on the side of freedom. (Applause.)
So, we are gathered here today in Ripon, not far, as the congresswoman mentioned, from a small building where the Republican Party was born in 1854. Liz Cheney stands in the finest tradition of its leaders.(Applause.) And if — and if people across Wisconsin and our nation are willing to do what Liz is doing to stand up for the rule of law, for our democratic ideals, and the Constitution of the United States, then together, I know we can chart a new way forward not as members of any one party but as Americans.(Applause.) Americans who are united — united in our devotion to the country we love.
I thank you all. May God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)
Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)

    October 04, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good evening, Michigan! (Applause.) Hey!
Oh. Oh, it's good to be back in Michigan. (Applause.) Hey, everyone.
Can we hear it for Eric Price? (Applause.)
Oh, it's good to be back in Michigan. Thank you all so very much. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you so very much.
And, Eric Price, thank you for your leadership of UAW 651, and all the work that you do. (Applause.)And I want to thank all the leaders who are here. This is — I mean, this is — we've got thousands of leaders who are here, and I thank them — (applause) — including all our friends in labor: Shawn Fain, April Verrett — (applause); all of the incredible elected leaders, starting with the Governor Whitmer, who is amazing and is my friend — my dear friend — (applause); Mayor Neeley; Senator Stabenow; Senator Peters; Representative Slotkin, who we will elect to the United States Senate. (Applause.)
And did you all see Magic Johnson? (Laughs.) (Applause.) Remember his number: 32? Today we got 32 days until the election. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
So, 32 days — 32 days.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay. We got some business to do. We got some business to do.
All right. Thirty-two days. And we know we will do it. (Applause.) And — and this is going to be a very tight race until the very end. This is going to be a very tight race until the very end. We are the underdog, and we know we have some hard work ahead.
But here's the thing about us: We like hard work. (Applause.) We like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. (Applause.)
And with your help, in November, we will win. We will win. (Applause.) We are not playing around.
So, listen, we know this election is about two very different visions for our nation: one focused on the past, and ours, which is focused on the future. (Applause.) We are fighting for a future where we tap into the ambitions and the aspirations of the American people and build what I call an ""opportunity economy"" so every American has an opportunity to own a home, build wealth, start a business. (Applause.)
And I'm going to speak about small — do we have small-business owners in the house right here? (Applause.) Right?
Okay. So, on the economy, I'm just going to spend a minute on small businesses. So — so — because let me tell you. So, growing up, our mother often worked very long hours, and so my sister, Maya, and I, we would go over to Ms. Shelton's house. Ms. Shelton was from Louisiana, and we called her our second mother. And Ms. Shelton was a small-business owner.
And so, from being a child, I know who our small-business owners are. They are community leaders, civic leaders. They mentor. They hire locally. They build up the community. They are part of the fabric of the community. (Applause.) And small-business owners are the backbone of America's economy. (Applause.)
So, in my plan to build an opportunity economy, one of the things I will do is raise the start-up deduction from $5,000 to $50,000 to help entrepreneurs start their small business. (Applause.)
You heard Eric talk about it. We need to build more housing in America. (Applause.) You know, my mother saved up for years to buy our first homes. I was a teenager by the time she saved up enough to do that. And right now, we know there's a serious housing shortage in our country, and it is part of what is driving up costs.
So, we will cut the red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes and provide first-time homebuyers with a $25,000 down payment assistance — (applause) — so you can just literally get your foot in the door, and you'll handle the rest.
We need to lower the cost of living. Look, our economy is making good progress. Just this morning, we got a solid jobs report, right? (Applause.) Over 250,000 jobs created last month; unemployment fell; and just a few weeks ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, which helps. (Applause.)
But there's still more we need to do. Prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it. And I have a plan on lowering costs on everything from health care to groceries, including taking on corporate price gouging. (Applause.)
Because as attorney general, I saw what happens where — there are few of them; they don't — not everybody but those who take advantage of desperate people — in particular, in the middle of an emergency — and there needs to be consequence. (Applause.)
I will give a tax cut to 100 million Americans, including $6,000 extending and expanding the Child Tax Credit, so during the first year of a child's life — (applause) — young parents have the support they need to be able to buy a car seat, to buy a crib, to take care of their child during that first year of their life, knowing it's about setting them on a path to do everything they have a natural desire to do.
And, look, let me — I say all this to say: I will always put the middle class and working families first. I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. (Applause.) I will never forget where I come from.
And we know we cannot have a strong middle class without American manufacturing. So, over the last three and a half years, we have brought manufacturing back to America, creating 730,000 manufacturing jobs. (Applause.) We announced the opening of more than 20 new auto plants in the United States. (Applause.) And we did it by investing in American industry and American workers. (Applause.)
And I will make sure that America — not China — wins the competition for the 21st century — (applause) — which is why, under my plan, we will invest in the industries that built America, like steel, iron, and the great American auto industry. I see you, Shawn. (Applause.)
And we will ensure that the next generation of breakthroughs, from advanced batteries to electric vehicles, are not only invented but built right here in America by American union workers. (Applause.)
And, Michigan, let us be clear: Contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive. (Applause.) But here's what I will do. I will invest in communities like Flint — (applause) — Flint, which helped build the auto industry and the UAW. (Applause.)
We will retool existing factories, hire locally, and work with unions to create good-paying jobs, including jobs that do not require a college degree — (applause) — because we understand a college degree is not the only measure of whether a worker has skills and experience to get the job done. (Applause.)
In fact, part of my plan is to outline all of the federal jobs that should not require a college degree and make that clear. And when I'm elected, I'm going to challenge the private sector to take on the same approach. (Applause.)
And then there's Donald Trump.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, Donald Trump has a very different approach. So, Donald Trump makes big promises, and he always fails to deliver. (Applause.)
He said he was the only one who could bring back America's manufacturing jobs. Remember that?
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And then America lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs when he was president —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — including — including tens of thousands of jobs in Michigan. And those losses started before the pandemic, making Donald Trump one of the biggest losers — (applause) — of manufacturing jobs in American history.
And his track record for the auto industry was a disaster. He promised workers in Warren that the auto industry would, I'll quote, ""not lose one plant"" during his presidency. And then American automakers announced the closure of six auto plants when he was president.
We need a medic over here. We need a medic over here. Right here.
Okay. Can everyone part so the medic can come through, please? Let's — let's let the medic through. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE MEMBER: He's okay.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay. He's okay? Okay. Okay. He's okay. All right. We're good. We got each other. (Applause.) Good. Good. Good.
So, remembering, again, what Donald Trump talked about versus what he did. Then automakers — American automakers announced the closure of six plants when he was president, including General Motors in Warren and Stellantis in Detroit.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thousands of Michigan autoworkers lost their jobs. And when it came to building the cars of the future, Donald Trump sat on the sidelines and let China dominate.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And then he talked down to American workers, saying we can't compete with Chinese workers.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And make no mistake, Donald Trump is no friend of labor. He encouraged automakers to move their plants out of Michigan so they could pay their workers less.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And when the UAW went on strike to demand higher wages that they deserved, Donald Trump went to a nonunion shop — don't forget — and he attacked the UAW. And he said striking and collective bargaining don't make, quote, ""a damn bit of difference.""
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Remember how he's talked about striking workers, that you should fire them. That's how he talks about union labor. That's how he talks about workers.
But, Flint, we know — we know: Strong unions mean higher wages, better health care, and greater dignity — (applause) — for union members and for everyone. (Applause.)
And on top of all of that, Donald Trump signed a $2 trillion tax cut that mostly went to the wealthy and big corporations, not to working people.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And now he is making the same empty promises to the people in Michigan that he did before. But we will not be fooled. We will not be gaslighted. Donald Trump's track record is a disaster for working people. (Applause.)
And if he wins again, it will be more of the same. Check this out. Two days ago, his running mate — maybe you saw that.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: No, but — how about that Tim Walz, by the way? (Applause.) (Laughs.) That's right. That's right.
So, two days ago, Donald Trump's running mate suggested that if Trump wins, he might let the Grand River assembly plant in Lansing close down —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — the same plant that our administration helped save earlier this year, along with 650 union jobs. (Applause.)
Michigan, we together fought hard for those jobs. And you deserve a president who won't put them at risk. (Applause.)
And for anybody watching, you know, if you want to learn more about Donald Trump's plans, just google Project 2025.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president. Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts, attack unions, cut Social Security and Medicare, and impose a Trump sales tax — a 20 percent tax on everyday basic necessities, which will cost the average pam- — family nearly $4,000 a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on top of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — even after he tried to repeal it time and time again when he was president and still has no plan to replace it.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Concepts of a plan!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You watched the debate. You watched the debate. You saw that. (Laughs.) (Applause.) He said —
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He said he, quote, has ""concepts of a plan"" — concepts.
Now, you know, I have said that I do believe he is an unserious man. And the consequences — and the consequences of him being president again are absolutely, critically serious.
Because, think about it. Even on health care, he has a concept of a plan. So, he's going to threaten the health insurance of 45 million people in our country based on a concept?
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: To take us back — do you remember that? — when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions? Remember what that was like?
Well, Michigan, we are not —
AUDIENCE: Going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — going back. We are not going back. (Applause.) We're not going back. We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are not going back. No.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Because we will move forward. Ours is a fight for the future. (Applause.) Ours is a fight for the future, and ours is a fight for freedom — (applause) — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
And these 32 days out from the election, it's important that we remind people how we got here. Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would overturn Roe v. Wade, and they did. And now more than one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral.
And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom — (applause) — as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly.
And here's what I want to say. Look, and that's not our only battle. Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard-fon — -won freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote — (applause); the freedom to be safe from gun violence — (applause); the freedom to join a union — (applause); the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride — (applause); and the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water. (Applause.)
Flint — you know all too well, Flint, that clean water should be a right for everyone, not just for the people who can afford it. (Applause.) And as president, I will continue to work with communities like Flint to ensure you not only have clean water but the opportunity to recover economically and thrive. (Applause.)
So, Michigan, it all comes down to this. We are all here together because we know what is at stake, and we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country. We love our country.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We love our country.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And because we love our country, we know it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to then fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. That's what this is about. (Applause.) That's what this is about.
So, Election Day is in 32 days. (Applause.) And already nearly 2 million ballots are in the hands of Michigan voters alone. (Applause.)
So, if you have received your ballot, please do not wait. Fill it out and return it today. Early voting starts statewide on October 26th, and now is the time to make your plan to vote, because, folks, the election is here. The election is here. (Applause.)
And we need to energize, organize, and mobilize. (Applause.) And remember: Your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. (Applause.)
So, Flint, today I ask: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Redford, Michigan
  


  

  
    October 04, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi. (Applause.)
Oh, good afternoon, everybody. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. It is my great honor to be with everybody this afternoon.
Matt, I want to thank you for your leadership and for all that you do for so many.
You know, everyone here, you all have chosen to live a life of service in the most extraordinary way. And I'm so thankful to all of you — to Matt, for your leadership — and everybody here.
And it is so good to be in the house of labor. Thank you all. (Applause.) Thank you all. Thank you all.
And, you know, yours is a profession that is more than a profession. It really is about a calling.
You know, my — I was just telling Matt — my brother-in-law just retired as a firefighter in California. So, for me, this is personal and it is professional. I know what you guys do, and I know your character. I know your families. I know what it means for the whole community for you all to take on the lives that you have decided to live, and I'm so thankful to you.
You guys work long shifts with unpredictable hours in some of the most dangerous conditions. You do so on behalf of people you've never met. Sometimes, those people will never know your name, but because of what you do with such sincerity and the highest level of skill and professionalism, their lives are forever better. And they always know and have the comfort of going to sleep at night knowing that should any tragedy come their way that you guys are out there and would be there.
It's an extraordinary thing you do, and it's a great gift that you have that you give. And so, I am so thankful to you. Thank you. (Applause.)
And, of course, I am thankful for the union that supports you and your right to all that you deserve in terms of the wages and the benefits that you so rightly have earned. (Applause.)
And I also want to thank the other brothers and sisters from labor who are here from UAW — (applause); IBE- — IBEW; LIUNA. Where are your orange T-shirts? I know you're here somewhere. I thank you all, all of you.
So, look, just yesterday, we saw another example of the power of collective bargaining — right? — when the longshoremen and the U.S. Maritime Alliance came together, ended a strike, and reached an agreement on a record wage. Right? (Applause.) They did good. They did good.
And I say, everywhere I go, look, collective bargaining benefits everybody. And you know the — the term — and I'm looking at our young leaders who are here. I'm so glad you guys are here. (Applause.) So, collective bargaining, it's really — it's just a basic logical point.
So, here's what it means. It means that in any negotiation, you want the outcome to be fair. Right? We all want fairness, right? Everybody wants fairness — or should.
So, here's the thing about collective bargaining. If you want the outcome to be fair, you got to realize, if you're requiring the one worker to negotiate against the big entity, do we really think that the outcome is going to be fair? Probably not. But if you let the workers together, as the collective, then negotiate against the big entity, it's more likely that the outcome will be fair.
That's the basic point of collective bargaining. That's the basic point of why we want our unions to be able to do their work on behalf of workers every day, because we know when union wages go up, everyone's wages go up. (Applause.) Yeah.
And when union workplaces are safer, all workplaces are safer. (Applause.)
And the bottom line is: When unions are strong, America is strong. (Applause.) And our unions have always fought to make our nation, then, more equal, more fair, and more free.
And in this election, in 32 days, everything we have fought for is on the line.
This election is about two very different visions for our nation: one that is focused on the past, and ours that is focused on the future.
We fight for a future where we protect the fundamental freedom to organize. We fight for a future where workers, all workers, are treated with dignity and respect; a future where we tap into the ambition and the aspirations of the American people and build what I call an ""opportunity economy"" so that every American has an opportunity to buy a home, start a business, build wealth — intergenerational wealth for their family.
Over the last three and a half years, our nation has seen historic small-business creation as an example of that focus.
In Michigan alone, we have seen more than 500,000 new small-business applications. And when I am president, I plan to build on that progress and that success, including by raising the start-up deduction — tax deduction for small businesses from $5,000 for — to $50,000 to help more entrepreneurs start a small business.
I'll tell you guys, my sister and I were raised by our mother, who worked very hard, and we lived on an apartment above a daycare center. And it was run by and owned by the woman that we called our second mother, who lived two houses down. She was a small-business owner, and her name was Ms. Shelton.
And I grew up as a child knowing about who our small businesses are, right? They're leaders in the community. They're civic leaders. They hire locally. They train. And so, that's one of the reasons I'm focused on small businesses as part of how we lift up the middle class in America's economy.
We need to also build more housing in America. Housing is too expensive.
My mother saved up for years, until I was a teenager, when she was able to buy our first home.
And right now, we have a serious housing shortage in America, and that's part of what is driving up costs. And so, we are going to cut red tape, we're going to work with the private sector, and we'll build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term — (applause) — including — including providing first-time homebuyers with a $25,000 down payment assistance so they can just get their foot literally in the door to be able to invest in the American dream — (applause) — which not everyone has access to these days.
We need to lower the cost of living, because, look, our economy, while we're making good progress — just this morning, in fact, we got a solid jobs report: over 250,000 jobs created last month, unemployment fell. And just a few weeks ago, the Federal Reserve cut down interest rates, which is going to be great for a lot of folks. But there's still more work we need to do.
Prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it, and I know it.
And so, we have a plan to lower costs on everything from health care to groceries, including what I've done in my career as attorney general, which is we got to take on corporate price gouging.
We got to take on what we need to do to understand that if you want to grow the middle class, we need more middle-class tax cuts. And the tax cut that is part of my plan will give a tax cut to 100 million Americans.
We need to expand Child Tax Credit, and I will do that to expand it to $6,000 so that for the first year of a child's life, their parents have the resources that they need to be able to buy a crib or a car seat, and in that very critical stage of their child's development, just be able to do more than get by but be able to get ahead.
And I say all this to say, I will always put the middle class and working families first. I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. I will never forget where I come from. (Applause.)
And we know we cannot have a strong middle class without American manufacturing.
Over the last three and a half years, we brought manufacturing back to America. We created 730,000 manufacturing jobs and announced the opening of more than 20 new auto plants in the United States. And we did it by investing in American industry and American workers.
And I want to make sure that America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century. (Applause.)
So, under my plan, we will invest in the industries that built America, like steel, iron, and the great American auto industry — (applause) — yeah — so we can ensure that the next generation of breakthroughs, from advanced batteries to electric vehicles, are not only invented but built right here in America by American union workers. (Applause.)
So, the election is in 32 days, and Americans have a big choice to make. And I think it's very important, then, to point out Donald Trump has a very different approach than mine.
And let's be real about who Donald Trump is. Let's be real. This is a time for real talk.
He was handed $400 million on a silver platter and filed for bankruptcy six times. This is a man who has only ever fought for himself. This is a man who has been a union buster his entire career, who has called union leaders, quote, ""Dues Sucking"" people. And as president, he did not lift a finger to save the pensions of millions of American workers.
We did. We did. (Applause.)
This is a man who sold promise after promise to American workers but never delivered, who said he supports so-called right-to-work laws ""100 percent."" Those are his words.
He who joked and laughed about firing striking workers. You remember that?
AUDIENCE: Yes.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Who rolled back labor standards and made it easier for companies that break labor laws to get federal contracts.
And Donald Trump is a man who tried to cut funding for our first responders, including SAFER grants for firefighters.
So, brothers and sisters, as we stand here in a house of labor, we will not be fooled. We will not be gaslighted. Donald Trump's track record is a disaster for working people, and he's trying to gaslight people all over our country. But we know the facts and we know the truth: He is an existential threat to America's labor movement. Just look at his track record to know.
He said he was the only one who could bring back America's manufacturing jobs — Michigan knows what I'm about to say — then America lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs when he was president, including tens of thousands of jobs in Michigan. And those losses started before the pandemic, so we're clear, making Donald Trump one of the biggest losers of manufacturing jobs in American history. (Applause.)
And recall his record — his track record for the auto industry. He promised workers in Warren that the auto industry would, quote, ""not lose one plant"" during his presidency. Then American automakers announced the closure of six auto plants when he was president, including General Motors in Warren and Stellantis in Detroit. Thousands of Michigan autoworkers lost their jobs.
And now he is making the same empty promises to the people of Michigan that he did before, hoping you will forget how he let you down. But we know, if he wins again, it will be more of the same.
Everything he intends to do is spelled out in Project 2025. If reelected, he intends to launch a full-on attack on unions and the freedom to organize. He will ban public-sector unions, roll back workplace safety protections, and appoint a union buster to run the Department of Labor.
And on top of that, Donald Trump will give billionaires and the biggest corporations massive tax cuts like he did last time.
He will cut Social Security and Medicare and impose what I call a Trump sales tax, a 20 percent tax on everyday goods and necessities, which will cost — the economists have said — which will cost the average American over $4,000 a year more.
And if that weren't enough, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act. And even after he tried to repeal it time and time again when he was president, he still has no plan to replace it.
Did you guys see the debate? (Laughter and applause.) ""Concepts of a plan."" He has ""concepts of a plan."" (Laughter.) Come on.
And, you know, I've said many times he is an unserious human — (laughter) — but the consequence of him is quite serious, because think about that: ""concepts of a plan.""
So, he's going to threaten the health care and health coverage of 45 million people in America based on a concept — think about that — to take us back to when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was like?
So, look, I'm here to say, and I think we all know: It's time to turn the page. It's time to turn the page. (Applause.) We're not going back.
America is ready to chart a new way forward, because we are not going back.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No, we're not. We're not going back.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: No, we're not.
And so, it all comes down to this. We are here together because we know what is at stake. And we are here together — and I'm looking at the young leaders — because we love our country. We love our country. (Applause.) Yes, we do. We love our country.
And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to then fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America.
We have 32 days to get this done, and we know this is going to be a very tight race until the very end. And we are the underdog, so we have some hard work ahead of us. But I know who's here. We like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. (Applause.)
And we know what we stand for, so we know what to fight for. We stand for opportunity, we stand for dignity, and we stand for the future.
And so, we know when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)
Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President in a Univision Town Hall with Enrique Acevedo in Las Vegas, Nevada
  


  

  
    October 10, 2024  

  
    MR. ACEVEDO: Madam Vice President, bienvenida. Welcome. (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
MR. ACEVEDO: Thank you again for doing this.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you.
MR. ACEVEDO: (Speaks Spanish.) (No translation provided.
Madam Vice President, again, thank you, and welcome.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. I'm very happy to be with you. Thank you. Thank you to everyone for taking the time to have this conversation. Thank you.
MR. ACEVEDO: Particularly this week, when we're facing a — a national emergency.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. So, the — well, let me start by — Enrique, thank you and Univision and everyone who is here for this conversation. It is (inaudible) —
MR. ACEVEDO: Let me — let me grab a microphone. I'm sorry they didn't mic you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah, no. It's okay.
MR. ACEVEDO: We'll fix it quickly. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Again, I thank everyone for taking the time to be here this evening and for this important conversation. And to Univision and Enrique, thank you.
You mentioned the hurricanes. I'll start by speaking to all of the people who are living in the Southeast corridor who have been so devastated by Hurricane Helene, Milton. And I cannot stress enough the work that we have been doing around the clock to make sure that the federal resources are on the ground, in partnership with state and local leaders, to do the work of giving people the relief they need so immediately, plus a commitment to helping people in the long term.
I do think that the crisis that we have just experienced and the ongoing effects of it, because of these hurricanes, are yet another example of the importance of having leadership at a moment of crisis who understands their role and responsibility.
I think for too long in our country, especially over the last several years, there has been a suggestion that, frankly, I think is quite backward, that suggests that the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down, instead of the real strength of a leader being who you lift up.
And in this crisis, like in so many issues that affect the people of our country, I think it is important that leadership recognizes the dignity to which each person is entitled, that leadership is about understanding the importance of lifting people up, understanding that the character of our country is such that we are a people who have ambitions, aspirations, dreams, goals for ourselves and our families and are entitled to have a leader who then invests in that, as opposed to a leader who is constantly trying to divide the country and have people pointing their fingers at each other, demeaning people.
And that, frankly, is a big contrast in this election. This election is taking place in 26 days, and I very much believe that the American people are being presented with two very different visions for our country.
MR. ACEVEDO: And we will — we'll talk about those visions today. (Inaudible) —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I look forward to this conversation, because I do believe — and I'll just close with this, and then, please —
MR. ACEVEDO: Of course, ma'am.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — is that the two visions, simply put, are that one is about the future and the other is about the past and taking us backward. And I do believe that the American people are ambitious and aspirational about an investment in the future in a way that we are optimistic while being clear-eyed.
So, I'm honored to be here to have this conversation, and I look forward to any questions. Thank you.
MR. ACEVEDO: Thank you so much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
MR. ACEVEDO: Muchas gracias.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
MR. ACEVEDO: And our thoughts and prayers, of course, are — are with the families affected, the people living in the affected area, like Ramiro. Ramiro Gonzalez, our first question, he's in construction. He lives in Tampa.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay.
MR. ACEVEDO: His home is there. (Speaks Spanish.)
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) I spent the night watching the news about Hurricane Milton.
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) We had another hurricane just two weeks ago —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) — Helene.
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) I've heard rumors that the administration didn't do enough in terms of relief for families affected by Helene. What would your administration do differently in the case of Milton?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, thank you for the question. And I hope your family is okay —
Q: They are.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and your home is okay.
Q: Yes, they are, ma'am.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay. So, there has been a lot of mis- and disinformation about what we have been doing over the last two weeks and what we are going to do going forward. And I have to stress that this is not a time for people to play politics.
You know, I started my career as a prosecutor, and when I worked doing that job of my goal of keeping people safe, I never asked a witness or a victim of crime, ""Are you a Republican? Are you a Democrat?"" The only question I ever asked is, ""Are you okay?""
And sadly, we have seen, over the last two weeks since Hurricane Helene, and now in the immediate aftermath of Milton, where people are playing political games, suggesting that — that resources and support is only going to certain people based on a political agenda. And this is just not accurate.
I have been working over the course of the last couple of years — not even a couple of years; my whole career — but couple of weeks with people on the ground in Georgia, in North Carolina, in Florida, in the Southeast corridor — Republicans, Democrats — to work in getting relief that is about bringing FEMA resources on the ground, reminding people that they are entitled to relief. Don't listen to anyone who says that you're not entitled.
Doing the work — I was just on a — a secure meeting today with the president, with the secretary of Defense, with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, with the head of the Coast Guard, with the general representing NORTHCOM, talking about how the federal, state, and local governments are working together for the benefit of the people on the ground.
Another piece of work that I've been doing — it's based on my years of being an attorney general in California — is telling those corporations and those companies that, during crisis and emergencies, jack up prices — and I've seen it happen before — that we're watching them. And at a moment of — of desperation for these individuals and families, whether it be to be able to get temporary shelter at a hotel, for gas prices, for even airline tickets, that we'll be watching, if they're jacking up prices, to make sure there'll be serious consequence. And that's the kind of work I will do going forward.
I have spent my career — the vast majority of my career concerning myself with the safety and well-being of people. And I promise you and I pledge to, as president, I will continue to do that.
You have a right to know that your government and its leaders are putting you first and not themselves.
Q: Thank you, Madam Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you.
MR. ACEVEDO: Gracias, Ramiro. Our next question is over here. Yvette Castillo, she lives here in Vegas. (Speaks Spanish.) She wants to share a personal story, Madam Vice President.
Q: Hi. Buenas noches, Vicepresidenta —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
Q: — Harris. (Speaks Spanish.) You and I have something in common. We both lost our mother.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Aw —
Q: And I'm an American citizen, born to two Mexican parents. They were here before I was even born. They have worked their whole lives. But with the way immigration laws change over time, I was only able to help my dad get his legal status squared away but not my mom's. My mom passed away just six weeks ago.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Oh, I'm so sorry.
Q: And she was never, ever able to get the type of care and service that she needed or deserved. (Cries.) Sorry.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Take your time. Take your time.
Q: So, my question for you is: What are your plans or do you have plans to support that subgroup of immigrants who have been here their whole lives or most of them and have to live and die in the shadows?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I'm so sorry for you.
Q: Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You must remember your mother as she lived. I have enou- — I have enough of a feeling about your strength that it probably comes from her to know she would want you to remember her as she lived and not as she died. Okay?
Q: Mm-hmm.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, let's take it one step at a time.
Your parents were here for years, it sounds like. And your father was able to earn his pathway to citizenship, but your mother was not. And I'm going to assume it's because part of the problem is that we do have a broken immigration system, including it being the case that even though, when we were elected in 2020, and the first bill we offered Congress — before we did the bipartisan infrastructure bill, before we did the work on gun safety, before we did the work on investing in chips and science — the first bill we offered within hours of taking the oath was a bill to fix the immigration system, including creating a comprehensive earned pathway to citizenship for hardworking people. And it was not taken up.
And now we look at a situation where people are suffering. The reality is that, in terms of having access to health care, had your mother been able to gain citizenship, she would have been entitled to health care that may have alleviated her suffering and yours.
And this is one example of the fact that there are real people who are suffering because of an inability to put solutions in front of politics.
I mean, an example of this on immigration policy is that, as it relates to what we need to do to strengthen our border, a bipartisan group of members of Congress, including one of the most conservative members of the United States Senate, came together with one of the strongest border security bills we've had in decades.
And it included 1,500 more border agents to go to the border to help those hardworking folks who are working around the clock. The border agents supported the bill. It included more resources to stem the flow of fentanyl, which is killing people of every background in every region of our country. It would have allowed us to have more resources to take on transnational criminal organizations. I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations, from the Guadalajara Cartel to the Sinaloa Cartel.
And Donald Trump found out about that bill, realized it would be a solution, and told them not to put it on the floor for a vote, because he would prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.
And, again, Enrique, we were talking about it. Wh- — in terms of real leadership, real leadership is about solving problems on behalf of the people.
And I'm so sorry for what you've been through. I'm so sorry for what you've been through. And, you know, my mother came to the United States at the age of 19. She was by herself — came alone by herself. She raised my sister and me — Maya. And I know what it is like to have a hardworking mother who loves you and to lose that. But I know that her spirit is alive. I know her spirit is alive.
And will you tell me her name? And let's speak her name.
Q: Maria Dolore- — (voice breaks) — sorry. Maria Dolores Figueroa.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Maria Dolores?
Q: Mm-hmm.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay. We speak her name. Okay?
Q: Yes. Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: All right.
MR. ACEVEDO: Muchas gracias, Yvette. Thank you so much, Madam Vice President.
We have Francisco Medina here with me. (Speaks Spanish.) He comes from San Diego, California, and has a question about access to health care. (Speaks Spanish.) Gracias, Francisco.
Q: Very nice to meet you. Thank you for being here.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Of course.
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) I have an injury in my knee.
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) I work for the Department of Defense, and supposedly we have very good health care.
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) But the time to see a specialist are just simply ridiculous.
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: Dos años?
Q: Dos años. (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) Finally, after two years, I was able to get an MRI.
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) But I had to wait for a month to start rehab.
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) So, I went across the border to Tijuana, Mexico, and in less than 45 minutes, I was already seeing in a specialist and having rehab.
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) What's your plan to improve the health care system?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, are you fe- — I hope you're feeling better now. I'm sorry it took so long for you to get the su- — the support you needed.
I firmly and deeply believe that access to health care is a right and should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it or have access to it easily. It should be something that we make accessible to all people.
Again, it gets back to my earlier point. It's about the dignity of people and about the importance of doing what we can as leaders to alleviate suffering. Right?
You know, when I — when I say earlier about what I think is backwards in terms of this thinking that it's a sign of strength to beat people down, part of the backward nature of those kinds of thinking is to suggest that empathy — right? — is somehow a weakness — empathy, meaning to have some level of care and concern about the suffering of other people and then do something to lift that up.
A lot of the work that I have done over the years, including as vice president now for almost four years, has been to address what we need to do to strengthen our health care system, whether it be what we do to strengthen the Affordable Care Act to make sure more people have coverage, to what we have done, which is we finally have capped the cost of insulin, for example, at $35 a month.
I don't know if this is interactive enough, if I can ask anyone: Raise your hand if you have a family member with diabetes. I — right? And seniors and what — Latinos are 70 percent more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. And so, when we capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month, what that means is it — it's the story I hear constantly, including recently, from a woman here in Las Vegas, which is finally her mother can afford to fill her prescription for insulin instead of trying to make it last for a longer period of time, even though that's going to lead to her health condition worsening.
The work we have done has been about capping the cost of prescription medication for seniors at $2,000. My intention, as president of the United States, is to now make that available not just for seniors but for everyone. The work that we must do is about understanding health care is a right and should not just be a privilege of those who have access to it.
Again, this is an election. That's why we're here, because we have an election coming up. There's a big contrast between me and Donald Trump.
When he was president of the United States, he and his friends 60 times tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. You remember what it was like before the Affordable Care Act? Preexisting conditions — when an insurance company could deny you access to health care for a preexisting condition, which could include asthma — your child has asthma; a survivor of breast cancer; diabetes. I mean, some would argue being a woman was a preexisting condition under that plan. Tried to get rid of it.
I — I urge everyone to look up Project 2025, which is his plan if he is elected president again. Google it. And you'll see the plan that he has that includes getting rid of Medicare, Social Security, and all of those things that are to the benefit of, again, the basic dignity of all people and, in particular, working people.
Look, I come from the middle class. My mother was a working woman who raised me and my sister. My mother was able to finally af- — she saved up to be able to afford to buy a home by the time I was a teenager.
I know everyone has ambition, works hard, has aspirations, but doesn't necessarily have all the resources that other people have. Access to health care should not be a function of how much money you have in your back pocket.
That's how I think about the health care system, including what we need to do to make sure that someone like you, who has dedicated yourself to our country and your work, has access and doesn't have to go to another country to get what you need.
Q: Gracias.
MR. ACEVEDO: Gracias.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
MR. ACEVEDO: Gracias, Francisco.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
MR. ACEVEDO: Thank you, Madam Vice President.
Over a million disability applications are stuck in our Social Security system. And Martha Rodriguez has a question about that.
(Speaks Spanish).
Q: Good evening —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good evening.
Q: — Vice President Harris. My name is Martha. I'm 62 years old and currently homeless. In 2020, I had a heart attack. Then I got diagnosed with long COVID, which will disable me for the rest of my life.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
Q: I lost my job, my income. I had no choice but to apply for Social Security disability. It's been three years I've been waiting for a decision. Because of no income, I lost everything. I have no health insurance. I can't get medical treatment that I need. And my question for you is: How will you help the disabled people —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
Q: — so that they can get insurance —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
Q: — and make America great again?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I'm so sorry for everything you've been through. Your point about long COVID, finally — I was actually part of pushing to make sure that long COVID is now recognized under the Americans with Disabilities Act. So, it is now recognized as being a disability for the purposes of allowing you and people who have long COVID to be eligible for disability benefits. And that's a very big point.
As it relates to disability rights as a general matter, it's something I've worked on for years. The point just being very simple, frankly, which is that all people, regardless of disability, should have equal access to housing, to job opportunities, to education, and, again, to dignity. And there's still a lot of work that we have to do in that regard.
What we have to do in terms of also making sure that somebody who experiences an acute illness does not lose everything is still work we have to do. Part of the work that I have been doing and intend to do as president includes, for example, dealing with the issue of medical debt. So, this is a big issue, which is people, through no fault of their own, experience a serious illness, and then they acquire all these bills and debt.
Right now, the system is that that medical debt can be used against your credit score — your credit score. Everybody knows their credit score. It's like — kind of like you know your weight, you know your credit score, right?
So, your credit score, as we know, will determine your eligibility for everything from a small-business loan to whether you qualify for a lease on an apartment. The unfairness of it — and this is what I intend to change — is that medical debt is not a measure of how responsible you are with money. It's about the fact that you experienced an emergency for which you did not plan because you did not invite it, and then it works against people's ability to do things like get an apartment.
So, there are a number of issues that I think you're raising around how we have to see the full person and understand how one thing connects to another, because, as you have explained, a health issue that then results in an issue about, literally, housing and whether you are unhoused; an issue that is about what you qualify in terms of benefits, again, to be able to live with dignity and have a — a quality of life to which you are entitled after what I can tell are years of working hard.
Q: I worked for 45 years before I got sick, and to be waiting so long —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
Q: And all they can say is it's because of the pandemic.
MR. ACEVEDO: Thank you so much, Martha.
Q: Pandem- — thank you.
MR. ACEVEDO: Thank you.
Q: I hope you address this.
MR. ACEVEDO: Gracias.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I will, and I'll remember your story.
Q: Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay?
MR. ACEVEDO: Thank you, Martha. Thank you, Madam Vice President.
Our next question comes over here from Mario Sigbaum. He was born in Uruguay but became a U.S. citizen 28 years ago. He lives in California. Mario, (speaks Spanish).
Q: Sí.
MR. ACEVEDO: Tu pregunta, por favor.
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) I'm reg- — registered as an independent.
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) I voted Democrat and Republican, but I'm confused right now.
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) You became a candidate without going through the primary sort of caucus, like it usually happens.
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) I'm right now leaning towards Trump, but I haven't made a decision. I'm also concerned about the way I feel President Biden was pushed aside.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Oh.
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) I think it's extraordinary circumstances, given how close we are to the election.
(Speaks Spanish.) (Laughs.) The question, Mario.
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) How do you respond to this process and how you —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Sure. And —
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) — how you got the candidacy?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: First of all, thank you for being so candid and allowing me to answer the question. Thank you.
President Biden made a decision that I think history will show was probably one of the most courageous that a president could make, which is he decided to put country above his personal interest. And he made that decision. He very — within that same period of time, supported my candidacy and urged me to run. He and I have been partners for the last four years as his vice president to — to him as the president.
And I am honored to have earned the Democratic nomination. I am honored to have the endorsement of people from every walk of life. You will probably find that I probably have a bigger coalition of people who couldn't seem to be more different than each other, who have come together around my candidacy — from 200 Republicans who worked with and for both Presidents Bush, John McCain, Mitt Romney; including Liz Cheney, the former congresswoman, and her father, the former vice president, Dick Cheney, who is supporting me; former members — very esteemed members, including generals, of the national security community. I have the endorsement and support of Alberto G- — Gonzales, most recently, who, of course, was attorney general.
I have the support of people from every background, and I believe this is the reason why: It is incredibly important — and I know you and I can see you are a patriot — that we have the president of the United States who honors the oath that they take to support the Constitution of the United States.
There is a huge contrast in this election. Donald Trump has said he will be a dictator on day one. Many people come from backgrounds and countries of origin, and we know what that means when you're talking about someone who wants to be president of the United States and wants to be a dictator and what that means in terms of taking freedoms from their people.
Donald Trump has said he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. I urge you to look at Project 2025, and you will see. He will strip the Department of Justice of its independence and put in and hire across the board, instead of career public servants, his people, who are his loyalists.
Donald Trump said he would — and I'm using a quotation — ""terminate"" the Constitution of the United States. Imagine. The Constitution of the United States, which guarantees the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure by a government on you; the Fifth Amendment; the Sixth Amendment.
So, I believe that the stakes right now are extraordinarily high and potentially — some might say, historians have said — unprecedented. And so, maybe the whole situation, including your point, is a bit unprecedented, but this is an unusual time, where we are literally having a choice, as the American people, about choosing a path either that is about rule of law, democracy, or something that is about admiring dictators and autocracy.
Did you see the most recent report about the COVID — we talked about COVID — the COVID test? The most recent report: Donald Trump, according to that report, during the height of COVID — I'm sure there are people here who have family members or friends who died, and he secretly shipped off COVID tests to Vladimir Putin of Russia, when people by the hundreds were dying every day.
D- — President Biden and I would work on it, because disproportionately Latinos and African Americans were dying.
So, I present that to you, sir, to say this is an extraordinary time. It's an extraordinary time. And what is being presented to the voters of America right now is a real choice and a real difference — so fundamental. This is not about a debate on trickle-down economic theory. It's literally about: Do we support our democracy and the Constitution of the United States, or are we going to go on the path of somebody who is a sore loser and lost the election in 2020 and tried to have a violent mob undo it? A violent mob that attacked the United States Capitol, that injured 140 uniformed law enforcement officers — some died — to undo the will of the American people in a free and fair election.
And I think, frankly, sir, that is why some former Trump supporters are supporting me. I think January 6th, for a lot of people, was just a bridge too far. It was just one step too far.
So, I hope to earn your vote, and I thank you for your candor. Thank you.
MR. ACEVEDO: Gracias, Mario.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
MR. ACEVEDO: Thank you, Madam Vice President.
We're going to try to get to as many questions as possible. We're just going to take a quick break.
(Speaks Spanish.)
(Commercial break.)
(Speaks Spanish.)
We're back. And, Madam Vice President, our next question comes from Arizona — from Yuma, Arizona, Carlos Garcia.
(Speaks Spanish.)
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) I come from Yuma, Arizona. And, as you know, your opponent has accused you of allowing the border to be out of control, as well as undocumented immigration.
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) I've seen Border Patrol agents exhausted from working long hours. I've seen fear in my community, as well as the borders are closed for us living across the border and inside.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: Border crossings, I should correct.
(Interpreting.) What would you do differently from what's been done in the Biden administration to make sure that the border is secure and orderly?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, and thank you for the question. And I was just recently in Arizona, at the border.
Let me start with this. Perhaps what distinguishes me from at least a couple of people: I was the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state in this country, California, that is also a border state. I have taken on transnational criminal organizations. I have taken on crim- — transnational criminal organizations that traffic in guns, drugs, and human beings, and I have prosecuted them.
I led a bipartisan group of attorneys general — American attorneys general to Mexico City to work with Mexican attorneys general to combine intelligence and resources to prosecute those cases, including what was going south as well as what was coming north.
So, I will put my record up against anyone in terms of the work I have always done and will always do to ensure we have a secure border, which is why I also mention, then, in the context of an earlier question, the point about the border security bill.
So, I was just in Arizona at the border. I spoke with the Border Patrol leaders there. They are wor- — to your point, they're working around the clock, and they need more support. Fifteen hundred more border agents would have gone to the border — except Donald Trump got in the way of that bill — many months ago, which would mean those many months of more resources going to help those very agents you are talking about; many months of what could have been happening right now in terms of putting resources into fentanyl and stopping the flow of fentanyl, which we know is killing people every day in America; the trafficking issue — and, again, work I have done and care deeply about.
So, my pledge to you is that, by the grace of God, and hopefully with your support as well, when I am elected president, I will bring back that border security bill, and I will sign it into law and do the work of focusing on what we must do to have a orderly and humane pathway to earned citizenship for hardworking people. I think it is a false choice for people who would say you do one or the other. I believe we must do both. I believe we can do both.
And my pledge to you is to work on that. The solutions are at hand. We need the political will.
And I thank you for the question.
Q: Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
MR. ACEVEDO: Thank you, Carlos. Gracias, Carlos. And thank you, Madam Vice President.
Our next question is over here. Jesús Aispuro is voting for the first time —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Oh.
MR. ACEVEDO: in November. (Speaks Spanish).
Q: So, good — good evening. My name is Jesús. So, it's been a couple years since I've gone out of college, and in that time, I actually met a lot of people, a lot of classmates — a lot of classmates that became friends. And, yeah, one thing that — that happened in that time is a lot of them were talking, feeling this theme of fear. And a lot of them — a lot of these classmates were actual DREAMers.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
Q: And, you know, they had to live day by day and —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
Q: — you know, have that — that fear in them.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
Q: So, my question to you is, how would you get these students under DACA the opportunity and citizenship to — to continue?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. And congratulations on being a first-time voter. That's wonderful. Your voice is your vote. And this is, again, part of the point of a democracy. As long as we can hold on to a democracy, each individual has the ability and the power to determine the course of our country through your vote and so many other ways.
So, our DREAMers — this is, again, a very big example of what the price is to pay for a broken immigration system. Our DREAMers, who you know — and they are friends, classmates, former classmates of yours — children who — who came very young to the United States, who have worked hard, who have built up a productive life, who are in universities, who are working in Fortune 500 companies, who are serving in our military — serving in our military, prepared to die for the sake of our country and what we stand for.
And one of the biggest problems with failure to have a — a comprehensive plan for immigration is that we have not given them the pathway to earn their right to citizenship. And that is — again, that is one of the priorities for me, frankly, in terms of my motivation for what I know we must do. And they're afraid. They're constantly worried.
I mean, there are court cases still where these young people — you know, now we're looking at millennials, some of them — right? — but who are still afraid. I — it pains me. I know many of them who are still afraid somebody might come knocking on their door.
And I just think it's important that we recognize who this population of young people are and agree that they have been so productive; they are prepared to do what is necessary by law. And I think it's — I think it should compel us to agree they should not have to live in fear but should have an ability to be on a pathway to earn their citizenship.
So, it is one of my priorities. And I've worked on this in terms of DREAMers for many, many years, and I'll continue to fight for them.
And thank you for the question. Thank you.
MR. ACEVEDO: Gracias, Jesús.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
MR. ACEVEDO: Gracias, vicepresidenta. Thank you so much.
We're going to take a quick break again. (Speaks Spanish.)
(Commercial break.)
(Speaks Spanish.)
Madam Vice President, our next question comes from Wendy Solares. Wendy lives in Los Angeles. Her parents are Mexican. (Speaks Spanish.)
Q: Buenas noches, vicepresidenta. (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) I come as a mother. It's my husband, my five daughters, and my parents living — living with us at home.
Q: Sí. (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) I've watched on the news that the cost of life has improved, but when I go to the grocery store, prices are up.
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) So, we went from spending $200 to over $350 in groceries.
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) The same goes for utilities like —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Water.
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) — water and energy and clothes.
Q: Sí. (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) I am a middle-class working woman, and you said we're ambitious, but it's hard to maintain that ambition when the conditions are so — so hard, so challenging.
Q: Yes. (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) How are you going to make sure that the cost of life doesn't destroy the — the middle class?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you for the question. And your point — listen, I know prices are too high still. You know prices are too high still. And we have to deal with it.
Here's how I feel about it. Again, you've heard my story. I — I come from the working class. I'm never going to forget where I come from. And part of what we have to do is build what I call an opportunity economy, where people have the opportunity, like you have described, for you to be able to work hard and your five daughters have an opportunity to then do what they and what you aspire for them to be able to do without having to worry about just getting by. I want you to be able to get ahead.
So, here's my plan. It includes what we need to do to bring down the cost of, for example, groceries. One of the issues I'm going to be taking on is price gouging, which is these corporations and companies who jack up prices unnecessarily, usually around people who are desperate. It's going to be about bringing down the cost of living.
For example, part of my plan is to expand the Child Tax Credit so that young families will get $6,000 during the first year of their child's life to help them be able to buy a crib, a car seat, the clothes, the things that they need during that critical stage of their child's development.
Housing — from Los Angeles — you know, I live in Los Angeles too. Okay. So, L.A. — all over the country, we know we have a housing shortage, and it's jacking up the price of housing, both for buying and renting.
Part of my plan is to work with the private sector. Listen, I'm a capitalist. I believe in the — the strength of the private sector to create jobs and to work with government to strengthen the economy. Part of my plan is to work with developers and builders to build 3 million more housing before the end of my first term.
And my plan is to give first-time homebuyers a $25,000 down payment assistance to be able to just get their foot in the door to buy a home, which is the source, as you know, of intergenerational wealth. When you have a home, when you have home ownership, that's how you build up capital and equity that you can use then for other purposes.
My plan includes small businesses.
You know, so, growing up, we lived on — we lived in an apartment above a childcare center, which was owned by the woman that helped my mother raise us. We called her our second mother. She was a small-business owner.
I know who our small businesses are, and they are — they are business leaders. They are civic leaders. They are community leaders. They hire locally. They mentor. And they need more support.
Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy. Part of my plan is for start-up small businesses — the — the tax deduction right now is $5,000, to extend it to $50,000 knowing what that will mean to tap into the ambition and the aspirations that people have; knowing that — unlike my opponent, who got handed $400 million on a silver tray and filed for bankruptcy six times — most people don't have that access to the wealth that is necessary for them to start a small business, but when they do, it's to their economic benefit as well as the economic benefit of the community.
So, these are just some of my plans. But there's another one that's more specific to, I think, your circumstance, and it's about also dealing with the sandwich generation. This is what we call people, like how you have described your life — people who are raising young children and taking care of their elder parents, and so they call it the sandwich generation because they're kind of in between.
And, you know, when my mother was sick, I took care of her. And it's — and I hope your parents are — are well and healthy, but when you are taking care of someone who is older — and for my mother, I mean, that meant trying to cook what — she had a taste for eating. It meant trying to give her soft enough clothes that wouldn't irritate her skin, make her try to laugh, you know, then bring a smile to her face.
And taking care of someone in that situation, it — it takes a lot out of people. And if you are raising young children at the same time and if you want to work, it's almost impossible to do it all. And so many people in that situation are having to leave the workforce — jobs they may love — because there's no way they can do it all.
So, here's my plan — and I just made an announcement about it — to allow Medicare to cover the cost of home health care for seniors. Medicare now doesn't do it. Now the situation is that that family or that individual would have to almost go broke and lose everything to apply for Medicaid. I'm saying, no, this is a matter of dignity. It's born out of a personal experience. Let's Medicare cover that so that you can have the home care that allows your — your parents to stay with you or stay in their own home and have the dignity of doing that, but have somebody there who you don't have to break your savings, who can be there to prepare a meal for them or help them put on their sweater.
So, these are some of my plans, and the way I think about it is all of this is about building opportunity for people and, in particular, the middle class. Seeing people as a whole human being, knowing that when you just lift up a little bit of the — the weight, people thrive and we all benefit. And so, that's how I think about the economy.
But we — we got to bring down prices, but we're still — the — the last numbers — just today, I think it was — inflation is now down to 2.4. So, the — you know, we call it the macroeconomic numbers are looking good, but it still doesn't change the experience you're having at the grocery store, and we still need to deal with that.
MR. ACEVEDO: Gracias.
Q: Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you.
MR. ACEVEDO: (Speaks Spanish.)
We're going to make a quick break.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay.
MR. ACEVEDO: We're on our last segment.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay.
MR. ACEVEDO: We're going to try to get to as many questions as possible. (Speaks Spanish.)
(Commercial break.)
(Speaks Spanish.) We're back. Madam Vice President, we have our next question over here. Cristian Galván comes from Wisconsin and has a question about reproductive health.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MR. ACEVEDO: (Speaks Spanish.)
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) As a woman, which is the biggest pride in my life, I have a daughter. I would like to ask you, what difference would it make if you become the first female president, and what laws would you enact to make sure abortion is regularizado — regular- — regularized?
That's the term she used.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Thank you.
So, we are in a situation right now where there are at least 20 states that have Trump abortion bans, because when Donald Trump was president of the United States, he hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade.
They did as he intended, and now in these states, we see bans that criminalize doctors and nurses — in Texas, up to prison and life for a doctor or nurse; laws that make no exception for rape or incest, which means you're telling a survivor of a crime of a violation to their body that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next, which is immoral.
And what I know is, I think most people believe that we should agree you don't have to abandon your faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body. If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government telling people what to do with their own body. And I feel very strongly about this.
Our daughter is going to have fewer rights than my mother-in-law in this year of our Lord 2024. And when we talk about what makes for what is right and what is wrong, I think we agree that there are certain decisions, especially over heart and home, that the government should just not be making for us, that we can make them for ourselves. And so, I feel very strongly about this.
And I'll tell you, there are probably many people here and watching who rightly have made a decision that they do not believe in abortion. The point that I am making is not about changing their mind about what's right for them or their family, it's simply saying the government shouldn't be making this decision.
And the other point I would make is this: What I'm learning as I travel the country on this issue is that people are realizing they may — some who feel firmly about abortion — that they are against it — didn't realize that what's happening because of these laws and what Donald Trump did includes that people who are trying to get in vitro fertilization treatment, IVF, are finding it more difficult or being denied.
What people aren't realizing is because of these laws, women are having miscarriages in parking lots. Women are being — I know I've met women who wanted to have a baby; they — with their husband — go then, out of an emergency because they're having a miscarriage, to a hospital and denied care because the doctors there are concerned they may be put in jail. I've met a couple of them who developed sepsis because they were denied care because of these laws.
So, as president of the United States — and if I am elected as the first woman president of the United States — I will proudly sign back into law the protections of Roe v. Wade, which basically just says it's the person's decision, not the government's decision. That, in essence, is what's behind my position.
MR. ACEVEDO: Gracias, Cristian.
Q: Thank you.
MR. ACEVEDO: Thank you so much. Our last question, Teresa, please go ahead.
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) I would like to ask you something more personal, putting politics aside.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Sure.
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) How do you value people who you don't agree with?
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) I think in Washington there are many. (Laughter.)
Q: (Speaks Spanish.)
MR. ACEVEDO: (Interpreting.) Could you mention three virtues of President Donald Trump?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, thank you for the question. (Laughter.)
I — let me start with this. I — I — basic — based on a life experience, I know that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And part of what pains me is the approach that, frankly, Donald Trump and some others have taken, which is to suggest that it's us versus them, whoever that may be, and having Americans point fingers at each other, using language that's about belittling people and calling them names and meant to make them afraid and — and live in fear.
I don't think that's healthy for our nation, and I don't admire that. And, in fact, I'm quite critical of it coming from someone who wants to be president of the United States.
I think he — I think Donald Trump loves his family, and I think that's very important. I think family is one of the most important things that we can prioritize.
But I don't really know him, to be honest with you. I only met him one time, on the debate stage. I'd never met him before, so I don't really have much more to offer you. (Laughter.)
But with the — with the remaining time I have — (laughs) —
MR. ACEVEDO: Yes, ma'am.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — one of the things that occurred to me in terms of the previous question, I invite anyone who's interested in my policy perspective to go on to KamalaHarris.com. It's my website, and you'll see I have 80 pages of — of my policies as it relates to the economy, health care — we talked about that — and so many other things.
And I invite anyone, if you're interested in more detail, please go there to see that.
MR. ACEVEDO: Thank you so much. Madam Vice President —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
MR. ACEVEDO: — thank you so much for this time, and thank you so much for having this —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you.
MR. ACEVEDO: — historic conversation with undecided Latino voters.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you.
MR. ACEVEDO: (Speaks Spanish.)
Thank you, again, for responding to their questions.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all.
MR. ACEVEDO: (Speaks Spanish.) (No translation provided.)
Good night. Thank you so much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you so much. Thank you again.
MR. ACEVEDO: Thank you, Madam Vice President. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Chandler, Arizona
  


  

  
    October 10, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good evening, Arizona! (Applause.)
All right. Can we say thank you to Gerardo? (Applause.)
Arizona! (Applause.) (Laughs.) Oh, my goodness. All right. Okay. All right. (Applause.) (Laughs.) Thank you all. Oh, my goodness. (Applause.)
Okay. All right. Okay. Okay. Come on. Come on. We got some work to do. We got some work to do. We got some work to do. (Applause.) All right. We got some work to do. (Laughs.)
Well, let me just say, it is good to be back in Arizona. (Applause.) And thank you all. There are so many — this is an extraordinary group of leaders, and I thank you all for the time that you have taken to be together —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — for us to have this kind — I love you back. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
I want to thank Governor Lewis of the Gila River Indian Community — (applause) — and to all the elected leaders here today.
Representative Gallego, who could not be with us, but, Arizona, let's send him to the United States Senate. (Applause.) And let's send former Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez — (applause) — to the United States Congress.
And let me say, it means so much to be back with the Gila River Indian Community. (Applause.) Last summer, I became the first vice president of the United States to visit this Tribal nation. (Applause.) And I strongly believe that the relationship between Tribal nations and the United States is sacred — (applause) — and that we must — and that we must honor Tribal sovereignty — (applause); embrace our trust in treaty obligations — (applause); and ensure Tribal self-determination. (Applause.)
And it is my promise: As president of the United States, I will defend those principles always. (Applause.)
And before I continue, I will say a few words about Hurricane Milton, which has cut a path of devastation across Florida and follows closely, of course, on the heels of the damage caused by Hurricane Helene to communities across the Southeast. I know, as you do, that our heart goes out to everyone who has been impacted by these storms.
Our administration has mobilized thousands of federal personnel across the region to work hand in hand with local and state officials to give folks the help they need. I have spoken with state, local officials — both Republican and Democrat — to let them know we will be with you every step of the way as you recover and rebuild. (Applause.) That is who we are. That is who we are.
So, moving forward, let me say that, Arizona, look, we have just 26 days until Election Day — (applause) — 26 days. And we are nearing the home stretch.
And this will be a very tight race until the very end. And we are the underdog. We are the underdog.
AUDIENCE: Woof! Woof! Woof!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) So — so, we have some hard work ahead of us, but we like hard work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work. And with your help, in 26 days, we will win. (Applause.) We will win. We will win.
And y'all might have seen — y'all might have seen that just last night, Donald Trump officially ruled out any more debates.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Now, I think it's a disservice to the voters. (Applause.) I also think it's a pretty weak move. (Applause.)
But even if he will not debate, the contrast in this election is already clear. This election is about two very different vusions — two very different visions for our nation. One, his, focused on the past; the other, ours, focused on the future — (applause) — including being focused on the issues that matter most to working families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, in- — (applause) — investing in small businesses and entrepreneurs. (Applause.)
Do we have any small businesses in the house? (Applause.) Yeah. Bless you. Bless you.
We believe in fighting to protect reproductive freedom. (Applause.) And we will always fight to keep our nation secure and honor our military service members. (Applause.)
These and so many others are the issues that matter to you and your families, which is why you have taken the time out of your very busy lives to be here this evening.
But that is not what we hear from Donald Trump. We don't hear about these issues. Instead, from Donald Trump, it's the same old, tired playbook. He has no plans — no plans for how he would address the needs of the American people. He is only focused on himself. (Applause.)
Well, folks, it's time to turn the page. (Applause.) It's time to turn the page. And America is ready for a new way forward — (applause) — and ready for a new, optimistic generation of leadership for our country. (Applause.) Which is why — Arizona, which is why Democrats, Republicans, and independents are supporting our campaign — (applause) — because they know we need a president who works for all the American people — (applause) — all the American people, because we know we have so much more in common than what separates us. (Applause.)
And we are exhausted with those who would try and have us, as Americans, point fingers at each other. We're tired of that. (Applause.) Enough. Enough.
And fighting on behalf of the American people has been the story of my entire career. I've only had, in my career, one client: the people. (Applause.)
As a young courtroom prosecutor, I stood up for women and children against predators. (Applause.) As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks — (applause) — delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure. I stood up for veterans and students being scammed — (applause) — being scammed by the big for-profit colleges. I stood up for workers being cheated out of their wages. I stood up for seniors facing elder abuse. And it is my pledge to you, as president of the United States, I will always fight for all the American people — (applause) — for everyone.
And together, we will build a brighter future for our nation — (applause) — a future where we build, for example, what I call an ""opportunity economy,"" where everyone has the ability to compete and have a real chance to succeed.
Under my economic plan, we will bring down the cost of housing. Arizona, you know that's an issue we need to deal with. (Applause.) We will help first-time homebuyers with their down payments with $25,000 down payment assistance. (Applause.)
We will help entrepreneurs start and grow small businesses, knowing you are the backbone of America's economy. (Applause.)
We will expand health care in a way that makes Medicare cover home health care for seniors — (applause) — because we know it's just not right that people have to spend down all their money to qualify for Medicaid to be able to take care of what is basically about dignity, when it comes to home health care. (Applause.) It's about dignity.
And so, part of my plan is to recognize you who are members of what we call the ""sandwich generation"" — (applause) — who are taking care of your young children and your parents at the same time — (applause) — knowing what that does in terms of the emotional, the physical, the mental burden that you are carrying just trying to take care of your family. And we need to have policies in our country that see you and lift you up, knowing it is a matter of dignity and just what is right. (Applause.)
We will lower the cost on everything from health care to groceries, taking on, for example, the issue of corporate price gouging. I've done it before, and I'm going to do it again. (Applause.)
We will give a tax cut to 100 million Americans, including $6,000 during the first year of your child's life — (applause) — to help you be able to buy a crib or car seat or all the things you need at that critical stage of your child's development.
And all of this is to say, I will always put middle-class families first. (Applause.) I come from the middle class. I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. (Applause.)
Now, Donald Trump has a different plan.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Just google Project 2025.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I continue to say, I can't believe they put that in writing. (Laughter.) You know, they — they published it, they bound it, and they handed it out.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: They're out of their minds!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: ""They're out of their minds."" (Laughter.)
And it is a detailed, dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president again.
Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Cut Social Security and Medicare is what he would do.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And impose what I call a ""Trump sales tax,"" a 20 percent tax on everyday goods and necessities, which will cost — the economists have said — the average American family nearly $4,000 more a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: On top of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Now, Arizona, I was a member of the United States Senate during that time — but during that time when he was president and kept trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I'm going to tell you about one particular night, which has a direct connection to all of you.
So, that one night, it was late, late, late in the night. They were trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act again, and it required one more vote to keep it intact, and that vote was the late, great John McCain. (Applause.) A great American, a war hero: John McCain. And I'll never forget that night.
So, we're all standing in the chamber, and we're waiting. And then, you know, in the Senate chamber, there are these big wooden doors, and it was like out of a movie. (Laughter.) The wooden doors broke open, and John McCain came walking into the well of the United States Senate — (applause) — and said, ""No, you don't. No, you don't. No, you don't.""
But Donald Trump is trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act still.
And guess — here's the thing. He has no plan to replace it.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Oh, you watched the debate. You watched the debate. (Laughs.) So, remember, he's got, quote, ""concepts of a plan."" ""Concepts.""
Okay, so let's think about that. You know, I've said, because it's true, he is an unserious man. And the consequences of him ever being president again are brutally serious.
Because think about this: concept of a plan. So, he's basically going to threaten the health insurance of 45 million Americans based on a concept and take us back then to what? To the time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, we are —
AUDIENCE: Not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — not going back. (Applause.)
We are not going back. We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back, no.
AUDIENCE: We are not going back! We are not going back! We are not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: No, because — no, because we will move forward. (Applause.)
Because ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom — (applause) — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body — (applause) — and not have her government tell her what to do.
And we remember how we got here. Donald Trump, when he was president, hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — that they would undo Roe, and they did as he intended. And now more than one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — including right here in Arizona, 3.5 million women. And many of these bans, like the one in this state, have no exceptions even for rape and incest. It is immoral.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I know we all know one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do. (Applause.) Not the government. If she chooses, she'll talk with her priest or her pastor or her rabbi or her mam — imam, but not the government.
So, Arizona, we need to fight this battle on every front. And in this election, you have the chance on the state level to vote yes on Proposition 139 — (applause) — 139 — and protect your right to make your own health care decisions.
And then, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide — (applause) — as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly.
But, look, in addition to that — you know, I'm traveling around the country, and across our nation, guys, we are witnessing a full-on attack on hard-won, hard-fought freedoms and rights, fundamental freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride — (applause) — and the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water. (Applause.)
A topic that looms large here in Arizona, and I know that topic well. I worked on drought resilience for years and helped secure historic resources for communities across the West to invest in water infrastructure, water recycling, and water storage. And I promise you, as president, I will continue to invest in drought resilience so that communities like those across Arizona have what you need to thrive. (Applause.)
So, look, so much is on the line in this election. Twenty-six days to go, and this is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher, because, remember, a few months ago, the United States Supreme Court told the former president he is effectively immune from whatever he does in office.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Now, because you all know, just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. He who has vowed, if he were reelected, he'd be a dictator on day one —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — who will weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies, and who has called for the, quote, ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States of America.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And let — let us be clear, someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States of America. (Applause.) Never again. Never again. Never again.
So, it all comes down to this. Generations of Americans before us have led the fight for freedom, and now the baton is in our hands. The baton is now in our hands because we here know what is at stake, and we love our country. We love our country. (Applause.) We love our country.
And I do believe one of the highest forms of patriotism —
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. (Inaudible.)
And one of the highest forms, then, of patriotism, of the expression of our love of our country is to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. (Applause.)
So, the election is in 26 days. Here in Arizona, early voting has already started statewide. (Applause.) You can cast your ballot today or any day between now and November 5th. (Applause.) So, now is the time to make your plan to vote. (Applause.) And if you have received your ballot in the mail, please do not wait. Fill it out today. Return it in today. (Applause.) I think some of you have. (Laughs.)
Because, folks, the election is here. The election is here, and we've got to energize and organize and mobilize.
And please, let's always remember: Your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. (Applause.)
And so, Arizona, I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

    Vice President of the United States: 2021-2025
  
  

  
    Teleconference Remarks by the Vice President During a Call with Jewish Voters Marking High Holidays
  


  

  
    October 11, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Douglas. Thank you, my darling husband.
And I want to thank you in front of all of the friends for all of the leadership that you have shown and the inspiration that you have given so many and, in particular, our young people. Many of you may know, Doug has been visiting everything from summer camps to youth organizations and reminding our young leaders of the importance of their pride and their strength, especially at moments like this. So, thank you, Doug.
And it is wonderful to be with so many friends during the High Holidays. And my wish, of course, for everyone is that you have a good New Year ahead and an easy fast.
Now, I know this year, as Ilan said, the High Holidays come at a particularly difficult time.
And earlier this week, of course, we marked the one year since the brutal Hamas terrorist attack on October 7. And I know it has just rekindled what has been an enduring and deep fear among Jews not just in Israel but in the United States and around the world.
And I know how the existence of a secure, democratic homeland for the Jewish people means so much for Jews and all of us, regardless of where they live.
I will never forget October 7, and the world must never forget. And we all must work to ensure nothing like the horrors of that day can ever happen again.
To that end, as president, it is my pledge that I will always ensure Israel has what it needs to defend itself from Iran and Iran-backed terrorists. And I will always support Israel's right to defend itself. My commitment to the security of Israel is unwavering.
And this — as Doug has said, as Ilan knows — has been a lifelong commitment, starting, as many of you know, when I was a young girl and collected donations on behalf of the Jewish National Fund to plant trees for Israel. Many of you probably recall those little blue boxes.
And, as president, I will always work to ensure the safety and security of the people of Israel and Jewish people here in the United States and around the world.
When it comes to the war in Gaza, we have seen so much suffering and pain over the past year, and it is time to bring the conflict to an end. And I am working to ensure it ends such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, freedom, and self-determination.
We are not giving up on a ceasefire and hostage deal. We cannot. And I will never stop fighting for the release of all the hostages, including, of course, the seven American citizens, living and deceased, who are still held. We are fighting for them every day. As Ilan and Doug have mentioned, I have met and spent time with their families. And we cannot and will not rest until all the hostages are home.
We know Hamas is not the only threat Israel faces. On October 8, Hezbollah began launching rockets at Israel, and the Houthis in Yemen began targeting Israeli cities.
And what is the common thread? Well, we all know: Iran, which has now also directly attacked Israel twice.
I am clear-eyed. Iran is a destabilizing and dangerous force.
When Donald Trump was president, he let Iran off the hook. After Iran and its proxies attacked U.S. bases and American troops, Trump did nothing. And he pulled out of the nuclear deal without any plan, leading to an unconstrained Iranian nuclear program.
On the other hand, our administration struck Iranian proxies in Iraq and Syria when they attacked American troops, and we are the first administration to ever directly defend Israel.
On April 13, I joined President Biden and our national security team for more than five hours as we and a coalition of nations that we brought together responded to Iran's unprecedented attack. And then, of course, last week, on October 1st, I was in the Situation Room for more than three hours coordinating in real time with our military leadership as our forces intercept milsi- — missiles over the skies of Israel.
Make no mistake, as president, I will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend American forces and interests from Iran and Iran-backed terrorists, and I will never allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.
Diplomacy is my preferred path to that end, but all options are on the table.
And let's be clear. Donald Trump is not only a threat on the world stage. As we have seen a rise in antisemitism in our own country, Trump has espoused dangerous and hateful antisemitic tropes, creating fear and division. He praised some of the neo-Nazi marchers in Charlottesville as, quote, ""very fine people."" He reportedly said Hitler did some, quote, ""good things.""
I have spent my entire career fighting antisemitism. I prosecuted hate crimes as a district attorney. I continued this work as attorney general of California, where I published an annual report on hate crimes to ensure that policymakers and law enforcement respond with a sense of urgency and an understanding of the ubiquity of the problem.
And as vice president, I am proud to be implementing the first-ever National Strategy to Combat Antisemitism, which, of course, Doug was an extraordinary leader in making sure would be created.
And as president, I will do everything in my power to combat antisemitism whenever and wherever we see it.
On the topic of antisemitism, I know, across the country, many Jewish parents, grandparents are worried for their children who are on college campuses. And I know many Jewish students have feared attending class in recent months.
As we know, in a democracy, everyone has a right to make their voices heard. I believe in the freedom of speech. I also believe there is no place for hate or violence in our country.
When individuals participate in calls to violence and harassment against Jews, that is antisemitism, and I condemn it. When Jews are targeted because of their beliefs or identity and when Israel is singled out because of anti-Jewish hatred, that is antisemitism, and I condemn it.
Each university must ensure all students and faculty are safe and secure on campus.
In the United States of America, we can and we must ensure people can peacefully make their voices heard, while we also stand up for the rule of law and stand up against hate, and this is a priority for me.
In conclusion, I will say, everyone, I believe, should have the freedom to practice their religion and express their faith and the freedom to be safe from violence and fear. In many ways, that is what we are fighting for in this election.
Ours is a fight for freedom, like the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body, like the freedom to be safe from gun violence, like the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride.
So, to the friends gathered, I know part of the reason we are on this call together is we love our country. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism, of an expression of love for our country to fight for the ideals of our country.
Election Day is in 25 days, and early voting is already starting in some states. So, let's, please, in the spirit of the holidays and in the spirit of this moment, let's please use these next 25 days to continue the work of building community and building coalitions. Let's remind each other we have so much more in common than what separates us.
And let's implement that spirit by also texting our friends, family members, and neighbors to make sure they know the stakes and to make sure they know their power in this moment.
And as we continue to energize, organize, and mobilize, let us know that we are all in this together, in this fight for our democracy, for our country.
And as I always say, when we fight, we win.
Thank you all. And please take care.
Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. I appreciate you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm touched. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That means a lot. Thank you, (inaudible). (Applause.)
Thank you. Please, please, please have a seat. I'm — I'm very touched and very honored. And thank you, all leaders who are here.
Mayor Giles, I thank you. You've been an extraordinary friend. And I really — I so appreciate the courage that you have shown to be so open and forward about the importance of us all working together, and your support has meant the world to me. So, in front of all of the friends, I thank you very much for all you've done. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
And former State Rep Shaw, I thank you as well. Is sh- — I — there you are. (Laughter.) Thank you for all the support that you have given as well. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
So, we are all here together because we love our country. We love our country. And I was talking with some folks recently about the importance of understanding the — the duality, frankly, that exists in terms of our democracy.
You know, as your vice president, I have now met over 150 world leaders — presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings — and when we, representing the United States, walk in those rooms, traditionally, we've been able to walk in those rooms chin up, shoulders back, with the earned and self-appointed authority to talk about the importance of democracies, rule of law. But I say, to a room of role models, here's the thing about being a role model: When you're a role model, folks watch what you do to see if it matches up to what you say.
And I tell you because I have traveled the country recently — including the many, many trips that I have taken over the last almost four years — but recently, in particular, where world leaders, allies have come up to me — we're now on a first-name basis; I've met with so many of them so many times — and they have said to me, ""Kamala, I hope you guys are going to be okay.""
One of the things that I think about and weighs on me sometimes is I hope we, as Americans, really understand how important we are to the world. We are so important to the world. Those people who fight for democracy, who fight for freedom, who fight for a life in which they can have opportunity, they hold us up and they hold us out as a model.
And that, as much as anything, is at stake right now in this election. And I know I'm speaking to a group of people who know that and know that well.
You know, I was raised to believe that hard work is important, it is important to look out for each other, it is important to understand that the vast majority of u- — of us have so much more in common than what separates us.
I was raised in a community of folks who understood that when we stand together, when we look for commonality, that's when we thrive.
And part of what we know has been happening in the last several years in our country is there's some powerful forces that are trying to divide us as Americans, would have us and cheer us on if we point fingers at one another.
There's this kind of backward thinking coming from some folks that suggests that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down, instead of what we know, which is the real measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. That's strength. (Applause.)
But — but truly, like i- — but — but I mean that intentionally. It's not only good and right. That's strength.
Because that's part of what is the perversion of what some people are suggesting, as though it is a sign of weakness to have empathy, to have some level of concern and care about the suffering of other people and then take it upon oneself to do something about that that is about lifting the condition of your fellow human being.
So, when we think about what's at stake in this election — whoa, it's packed with some stuff. (Laughter.) It's packed with some fundamental stuff — (applause) — I say rather articulately. (Laughs.) There's so much at stake.
Mayor, you mentioned John McCain. Okay. So, I'll tell you, I was in the United States Senate for about four years, and — and I worked with John McCain. And so, I'll tell you, so there was this — we were on a committee together. And, you know, these committee rooms in the United States Senate, they're very grand and — and very impressive. And John McCain was on one side of the dais; I was on the other — horseshoe.
And he's going after me. He's going after me. We're having some conversation. I think it was about one of the nominees. This — this was during President Trump's years. He's going after me, and I'm going back after him. (Laughter.) I'm going back after him. And that was it. And this is what the public saw.
And then I step onto the floor of the well of the Senate later that day — we had votes — and I passed by John McCain, and he looks at me and he says, ""Kid, come over here."" (Laughter.) ""You're going to make a great senator."" (Laughter and applause.) True story. True story. True story.
That was John McCain. That was John McCain.
I was talking about him last night at a rally, right? John McCain, who — you know, we didn't agree on everything, but, man, I mean, what about an incredible American hero? (Applause.)
Again, strength — strength — right? — we know what the former president said about John McCain; I'm not going to repeat it here — but strength.
John McCain stood on principle. He stood on a belief in the — in the importance of — of patriotism, of sacrifice, of what we stand for as a country.
And part of what I talked about at a rally last night is — I — I shared with the folks in the room: I was there on the Senate floor, way into the middle of the night, when it was yet another attempt of the former president to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which, as we know, has been literally a lifesaver for people, right? (Applause.) What it has done to no longer allow preexisting conditions to be the reason that an insurance company can't give you assistance. Right?
And you all may have seen it. I was there on the floor that night, and we were all standing around because whether or not the Affordable Care Act would continue to be relied on one vote. And we were all standing on the floor. And, of course, I had voted to keep it going. And — and I say this, and it sounds like it's out of a movie, but this is how I experienced it.
On the flo- — floor with my colleagues in the Senate well — it was late into the night, and they — in the Senate, they had the — you walk onto the Senate floor, and there are these big, wooden ornate doors. And those ornate doors opened — (laughter) — and John McCain came out.
And he went to the floor, and he said, ""No, you don't."" (Applause.) He said, ""No, you don't."" ""No, you don't take away health care for millions of people.""
And that is but one example of an individual that we all respect who put country before party in terms of what they thought was right. I am honored to have the endorsement of Jeff Flake, someone I also worked with — (applause) — again, putting country before party.
And so, I say all of that to say that those are examples that are situated right here in this beautiful state of Arizona, a tradition that everyone, and all of us, I will say, stand on.
And then, of course, most recently, what Maricopa did in terms of the clerk refusing to participate in the intention to undo the will of the people in a free and fair election. The people of this state have always shown extraordinary courage to stand up for the principles upon which we as a country were founded. And I thank you for that. I thank you for that.
I know we are going to win this election, and it is not going to be easy. There are forces at play that are making us, as- — as Americans, I think, call into question certain fundamentals that we have always taken for granted, that is part of our pride: freedom — freedom — freedom from the government making decisions about a person's body, a woman's body; freedom to just be; freedom over matters of heart and home, I like to say; fundamental principles around the importance of rule of law, whether we should actually be concerned and have a question — a legitimate question in an election for president of the United States, the commander in chief, of whether they will abide by the oath. (Applause.)
But imagine — imagine. That's a legitimate question we are asking. It's not rhetorical. It's a legitimate question we are asking.
He who said that he would, quote, ""terminate"" the Constitution of the United States. He who said he would be a dictator on day one. He who intends to weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies — take away the independence of the Department of Justice and put in place loyalists.
Fundamental notions about who and what we are as a democracy are at play in this election. And you all, each of you, have had the courage to say, hey, we may not agree on every single thing — that's also what a democracy looks like — but foundational, first principles cannot be in question, not for the sake of our children, not for the sake of our future and well-being, not for the sake of our standing in the world.
And so, I tell you all this to just reaffirm that we — we share not only a concern but a commitment to our country and what's most important about, in a moment of crisis — dare I say, I think this is one — do we stand together as Americans being our first identity and come together around these issues?
And I — I'm going to actually announce — we have press in the room — that I have decided also — not only will I have a Republican in my Cabinet, but I'm also going to — I — I was talking to my team about it. I want to create some structure around the following, which is: I love good ideas. Wherever they come from, I love good ideas. (Applause.) Right?
And so, part of what I intend to do, Mayor, and put some structure around is creating a bipartisan council of advisers who can then give feedback on policy as we go forward. Because here's the thing I also understand and feel strongly about: In order for us as America to maintain our status as the strongest democracy in the world, we need a healthy two-party system. We have to have a healthy two-party system. (Applause.) We have to. It's in the best interest of all of us. It's in the best interest of all of us.
You know, the way that I like to lead — I bring folks in my office all the time, and they know I don't want any ""yes"" people. I want people to come in and, first of all, be prepared. (Laughter.) Yeah, no time to waste. But come in and then let's — let's, as I often say, kick the tires on ideas. Because the best ideas will survive those kinds of challenges, and the best ideas will then be most relevant to the American people, most in- — effective to the American people.
And so, I'm going to create a bipartisan council so we can put some structure around exactly this point and do the work that is important.
And then I'm — I'm just going to close with this. You know, again, I think on the fundamentals, we have more in common than what separates us, including across faiths.
So, I know there are mem- — a lot of members of the LDS community here, and you may or may not know my pastor actually spoke at the 100th birthday of President Nelson. (Applause.) Yeah. Yeah.
And I just — and that wasn't a plan as part of this. It just is. And — and I just think if we think in our lives and in what we know, there are so many examples of that point. We have so much more in common than what separates us, especially on the fundamentals.
And so, with that, I say that I am committed to all of you to be a president for all Americans and to work as we must — together — again, knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us. And on the biggest and most important issues, I think we know that this is a fight that is not against something as much as it is a fight that is for something. (Applause.)
Thank you.
God bless you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Greenville, North Carolina
  


  

  
    October 13, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: North Carolina! Good afternoon, North Carolina! (Applause.) Oh, my goodness.
Can we hear for Thomas? (Applause.)
Good afternoon. (Applause.) It is good to be at E.C.U. (Applause.) And it's so wonderful to be back in North Carolina. Thank you. (Applause.) It is so good — I see you.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: North Carolina loves you!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And — thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, thank you.
And I want to thank — there — this is — this is an auditorium packed with incredible leaders. And I thank you all for taking the time this Sunday afternoon with all that you have going on. (Applause.) I thank you. I thank you. Thank you all.
I want to also thank State Senator Smith; State Senator Hunt, your next lieutenant governor — (applause); Congressman Davis, a proud graduate of ECU. (Applause.) And let's elect Josh Stein as your next governor. (Applause.)
And he and Governor Cooper are not here today because they are s- — they've been working around the clock dealing with the hurricane recovery efforts. (Applause.) And we want to always thank them and all the — the incredible local, state, and federal leaders who have been working together for North Carolina.
I was here eight days ago in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. And since then, of course, another powerful storm — Hurricane Milton — cut a path of destruction through Florida. And our hearts — I know, all of us — and our prayers go out to everyone who's been impacted by these storms. (Applause.)
I have spoken to both state and local officials, both Republican and Democrat, to let them know we will be with you every step of the way as you recover — (applause) — because in times like this, we stand together as one nation. That is who we are. (Applause.)
So, North Carolina — (applause) — we have 23 days until Election Day. And we are nearing the homestretch. We are nearing the homestretch.
Now, listen, let me just say, I know we are really excited to see each other. I couldn't be more excited to see everybody here, but I'm going to tell you: It's going to be a tight race until the very end, and we are running as the underdog.
So, we have some hard work ahead of us, but we like hard work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work.
And with your help, in 23 days, we will win. (Applause.) We will win. We will win. Yes, we will. We will win.
So, what we know —
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We will win. And here's why — and here's why. One of the reasons is that — we all know and we are gathered here together because we know this election really is about two very different visions for our nation. One, his, focused on the past. The other, ours, focused on the future. (Applause.)
Ours is a campaign focused on issues that matter, for example, to working families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in small businesses and entrepreneurs. (Applause.) How many small-business owners do we have here? (Applause.) Thank you.
We are focused on protecting reproductive freedom. (Applause.) We are focused on keeping our nation secure. (Applause.)
But none of that is what we hear from Donald Trump.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Instead — instead, from him, we are just hearing from that same old, tired playbook. He has no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people. He is only focused on himself.
And he's not — but here's the thing, North Carolina — and he's not being transparent with the voters. He's not being transparent.
So, check this out. He refuses to release his medical records.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I've done it. Every other presidential can- — every other presidential candidate in modern era has done it.
He is unwilling to do a ""60 Minutes"" interview, like every other major party candidate has done for more than half a century.
He is unwilling to meet for a second debate.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And here's the thing — here's the thing. It makes you wonder. It makes you wonder: Why does his staff want him to hide away?
One must question — one must question: Are they afraid that people will see that he is too weak and unstable to lead America? (Applause.) Is that what's going on?
So, folks, for these reasons and so many more, it is time to turn the page. (Applause.) It is time to turn the page, because America is ready to chart a new way forward, ready for a new and optimistic generation of leadership — (applause) — which is why Democrats, independents, and Republicans are supporting our campaign — (applause) — because they and we know we need a president who works for all the American people. (Applause.)
And that has been the story of my entire career. I have only ever had one client: the people. (Applause.)
As a young courtroom prosecutor, I stood up for women and children against predators. (Applause.) As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks and delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure. (Applause.) I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by the big for-profit colleges. (Applause.) I stood up for workers being cheated out of the wages they were due, stood up for seniors facing elder abuse.
And as president, it is my pledge to you that I will always fight for all the American people. (Applause.)
And together, we will build a brighter future for our nation, and that future includes building what I call an opportunity economy, where everyone can compete and have a real chance to succeed.
Under my economic plan, we will bring down the cost of housing and help first-time homebuyers with a $25,000 down payment assistance. (Applause.) We will expand Medicare to cover home health care for seniors — (applause) — so more seniors can live at home with dignity; and give more support to the sandwich generation, to those of you who are raising young children and taking care of your parents. (Applause.)
And, look, I just have to say something about home health care and the need that I know so many people have for help. Look, so, when my mother was sick, after she had been diagnosed with cancer, I took care of her. And for those of you who have taken care of somebody who needs that kind of help, it's about trying to cook something that they have a taste for and want to eat. It's about trying to find something that they can wear that — that is not irritating their skin and is soft enough. It's about trying, from time to time, to figure out something you can do to just bring a smile to their face or make them laugh, right?
It's the work that is about giving folks dignity. But far too many people — on this issue of home health care — if you need the support to give that care to your family member, it means either paying down and losing as much as you can to be able to afford to have Medicaid or having to leave your job, which means cutting off a very important part of your income, just to give people in your life the dignity and the support they deserve.
That's why I'm saying we're going to have Medicare cover that home health care — (applause) — to help you — to help you.
We will lower costs, including on everything from health care to groceries. I will take on corporate price gouging. I've done it before, and I'll do it again. (Applause.)
I will give a middle-class tax cut to 100 million Americans, including $6,000 during the first year of your child's life, knowing that the vast majority of parents have a natural desire to parent their children well but not always the resources to be able to do it. And so, extending the Child Tax Credit to $6,000 to give folks the ability to be able to buy that car seat or that crib in that most fundamental phase of their child's development.
So, all this to say, I will always put the middle class and working people first. (Applause.) I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. (Applause.)
Now, Donald Trump, well, he has a different plan.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Just Google ""Project 2025."" It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president.
Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts, cut Social Security and Medicare, make it easier for companies to deny overtime pay for workers.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He would get rid of that $35 cap on insulin for seniors.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He would impose what I call a ""Trump sales tax,"" a 20 percent tax on everyday basic necessities which will cost the average American family $4,000 more a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on — on top of all of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he has no plan to replace it.
Did you see the debate? He has ""concepts of a plan."" (Applause.)
So — okay, so he's going to threaten the health insurance coverage of 45 million people based on a concept — come on — and take us back to when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions? You know where I'm going.
Well, we are not going back! (Laughs.) (Applause.) No, we're not. No, we're not.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: No, we're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Because we will move forward. (Applause.)
Ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom, like the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. (Applause.)
Because we know Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended.
And now, more than one in three women in America lives in a state with the Trump abortion ban, including right here in North Carolina.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Many of these bans have no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral. To tell a survivor of a violation to their body that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next? That's immoral.
And let us agree — let us agree: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree it shouldn't be the government telling her what to do — (applause) — not the government. If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government telling her what to do.
And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law — (applause) — proudly.
And North Carolina, across our nation — I'm telling you, I'm traveling — we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard-won fundamental freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote — (applause); the freedom to be safe from gun violence — (applause); the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.)
So much is on the line in this election. And this is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher, because a few months ago, the United States Supreme Court basically told the former president that he would effectively be immune from whatever he does in office.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But let's think about that. You know, you all have heard me say: I do believe Donald Trump is an unserious man, but the effects of him being back in the White House would be brutally serious.
Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. He who has vowed, if reelected, he would be a dictator on day one; that he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. He has called for the, quote, ""termination"" —
AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Oh, wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
AUDIENCE: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hold on, because here's the thing — here's the thing. Let's let the courts handle that, and let's handle November. (Applause.) We'll handle November. How about that? (Laughs.)
Because, listen, here's why — this is what we know. Anybody who wants to be president of the United States who has called for the, quote, ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States should never again have the ability to stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. (Applause.) Never again. Never again.
And the people who know him best know it. His former national security adviser, two of his former Defense secretaries, his former chief of staff in the White House, his own vice president have all warned America: Donald Trump is unfit to serve. (Applause.)
Or just listen most recently to what we heard General Milley said. General Milley, chairm- — former chairman of the Joint Chiefs under Donald Trump. It was just reported he said, quote, ""No one has ever been as dangerous to this country,"" in referring to Donald Trump. Think about that. Think about that.
And we can already see the harm he's up to as a candidate. Most recently, spreading disinformation in the wake of natural disasters, blocking real solutions that would stop drug cartels from crossing the border when he tried to kill — and did — that border security deal.
Because, you see, Donald Trump cares more about scaring people, creating fear, running on a problem, instead of what real leaders do, which is to participate in fixing problems. (Applause.)
Well, I care about fixing problems, and as president of the United States, I will be focused each and every day on solving problems that affect you and your family. (Applause.)
So, North Carolina, it all comes down to this. We — we are here together this Sunday afternoon because we know what is at stake. We are here together this Sunday afternoon because we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes, that's right.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. That's right. That's right.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We love our country. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to then fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America — the promise of America.
So, Election Day is in 23 days. And in just four days, early voting will begin statewide. (Applause.) Starting Thursday, you can go to the polls and cast your ballot. (Applause.) If you haven't already registered to vote, you could do it right then and there: register to vote and vote.
And so, now is the time to make your plan to vote. And if you've not received your ballot in the mail, look for it, because if you have, I would like you to fill it out right away. (Laughter.) Please don't wait, because, to my friends, I say, look, the election is here. The election is here.
And remember always that your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power — (applause) — is your power.
And so, North Carolina, today I then ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)
God bless you all. God bless you. (Applause.)

Okay, okay, thank you. Thank you everybody. Thank you everybody. (Applause.)
And I want to thank all of the leaders who are here. Thank you all for taking time out of your busy lives to be here this evening and for all of us to be together.
Can we hear for Senator Fetterman — (applause); your next state attorney general Eugene DePasquale — (applause); Mayor Schember — (applause); Bob Casey, who could not be here tonight because he's out doing what he needs to do to get reelected to the United States Senate. (Applause.)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay. Okay, so here's the thing, Pennsylvania, we got just 22 days until Election Day — 22 days — (applause) — and we are nearing the home stretch.
But here's the thing, this is going to be a tight race until the very end. Okay? We are the underdog. We are running like the underdog. We have some hard work ahead of us. But here's the thing also: we like hard work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work. And with your help, in 22 days, we will win. (Applause.) We will win.

Well, folks, it's time to turn the page. (Applause.) It's time to turn the page. Turn the page, because America is ready to chart a new way forward. (Applause.)
And America is ready for a new and optimistic generation of leadership — (applause) — which is why Democrats, Republicans, independents are supporting our campaign — (applause) — because we need a president who works for all the American people. (Applause.) We are all in this together.
And as you all know, this has been the story of my entire career. My entire career, I've only had one client: the people. (Applause.)
As a young courtroom prosecutor, I stood up for women and children against predators. As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks, fought to deliver $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure. (Applause.)
I stood up for veterans and students who were being scammed by for-profit colleges — (applause); for workers who were being cheated out of the wages they were due — (applause); for seniors facing elder abuse.
And it is my pledge to you, as president, I will always fight for all the American people — (applause) — always. And together — together, we all will build a brighter future for our nation. (Applause.) Together, we will build a future where we have what I call an ""opportunity economy,"" where everyone can compete and have a real chance to succeed — not just to get by, but to get ahead. (Applause.)
Under my economic plan — and, by the way, you know, so, dude wants to talk about his plans, which really are about cutting taxes for the richest people. Please do check out the Wall Street Journal or Goldman Sachs or the 16 Nobel laureates or Moody's, who have all analyzed the plans and said mine will strengthen the economy, his will make it weaker. (Applause.) Okay?
So, under my economic plan, we will bring down the cost of housing — (applause) — and help first-time homebuyers — giving them $25,000 for down payment assistance, so you can just — (applause) — so you can just get your foot in the door. You'll do the rest. You'll save up. You'll work hard. But just to help people get their foot in the door. (Applause.)
We will help entrepreneurs start and grow small businesses. How many small-business owners do we have here? (Applause.) Right? I love our small businesses. I love — you guys know — it's a part of my story — you know, my mother worked hard. We grew up — we lived in an apartment above a daycare center, and it was owned —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Woo!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — by our — yes, daycare centers. Bless you. (Laughter.)
And it was owned by Ms. Shelton, who we think of and thought of as — as our second mother. And she was a small-business owner. And Ms. Shelton, she was like all of you who do this work. You are business leaders, but you are community leaders. You are civic leaders. You mentor. You hire locally. I love our small businesses. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy. (Applause.)
So, you all know what I'm talking about. And as we move forward, what we are going to do in terms of knowing that small businesses must get the support you need to start up and to grow.
We will expand, under my economic policy, Medicare to cover home health care for seniors — (applause) — so more seniors can live at home with dignity. And like so many of my priorities, it is born out of a personal experience.
Look, when my mother got diagnosed with cancer, I took care of her. And for any of you who have taken care of someone — a senior, in particular — you know what that's like, and it's about trying to cook something for them that they might enjoy eating. It's about trying to make sure that they have something that they can wear that won't irritate their skin, right? It's about trying to, from time to time, find a way to just bring a smile to their face or make them laugh. It's about dignity. It's about dignity. It's about dignity. (Applause.)
But far too many people who want and need to take care of family members, either you have to leave your job or spend down everything you have to be able to qualify for Medicaid. That's not right.
I look at the sandwich generation. So, we — we refer to folks who are raising young children and taking care of your parents, ""the sandwich generation."" You're right in between balancing all of that. It's a lot of pressure, and you need and deserve to have the support to be able to handle all of that in a way that we know you are adding so much to our community, societies, and our economies.
So, I have a plan, and my plan is to make sure Medicare — not so you have to pay down everything and get on Medicaid — so that Medicare helps pay for home health care — (applause) — so you can do the work you need to get done in terms of the seniors in your life.
Under our plan, we will lower the cost on everything from health care to groceries.
Look, I'm going to take on corporate price gouging, just like I've done before. I'm going to do it again. (Applause.)
And give a middle-class tax cut to 100 million Americans, including $6,000 during the first year of your child's life — (applause) — knowing, again, the vast majority of parents want to parent their children well, but don't always have the resources to do it. And so, by expanding the Child Tax Credit that helps a young family buy a car seat, buy a crib, do the things in that so fundamental stage of their child's development just to get them on the road to what they desire and want to do. And we all benefit from it. We all benefit from it. (Applause.)
So, all of this is to say I will always put the middle class and working families first. I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. (Applause.) Never forget where I come from. Never.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So — so I just outlined for you a little bit — a little bit about my plan. Now let's talk about Donald Trump. Well —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He — he had — he has a very different plan. Take, for example, Project 2025. Just google it.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It is a detailed and dangerous plan for what he will do if he is elected president.
You know, you all probably heard me say Donald Trump — I think in our collective opinion, certainly mine — is — is an unserious man. (Laughter.) But the consequences of him ever being president again are brutally serious — brutally serious.
So, on Project 2025 and his plan, Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts, like he's done before, cut —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — cut Social Security and Medicare.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: The plan on that end is to get rid of the $35 cap on insulin for seniors —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — to make it easier for companies to deny overtime pay for workers.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You g- — you got to read the plan.
I mean, the fact they put it in writing is a whole other thing to be discussed. (Laughter.)
And he plans to impose what I call a ""Trump sales tax,"" a 20 percent tax on everyday necessities, which economists have measured will cost the average American family more than $4,000 a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on top of all of this, Donald Trump intends to get rid of the Affordable Care Act —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and he has no plan to replace it.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Concepts!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) You guys watched the debate. (Laughs.) Right. He has, quote, ""concepts of a plan."" ""Concepts.""
But seriously, think about it — in all seriousness, he's going to then threaten health insurance coverage for 45 million people based on a concept? (Laughter.) The seriousness of this cannot be overlooked. Think about that — taking us back to a time we all remember when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was?
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, we are not going back. We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are not going back. No. We —
And why are we not going back? Because we will move forward — (applause) — because ours is a fight for the future.
And it is a fight for freedom, like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. (Applause.)
And we all remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, and they did.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And now — now, in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban. Think about that. Many of these bans have no exceptions, even for rape and incest, which is saying to a survivor of a crime of a violation to their body that you have no right to make a decision about what happens to your body next. That's immoral. That's immoral.
And let us agree: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do — not the government. (Applause.) No. No.
If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her rabbi, her pastor, her imam, but not the government telling her what to do. Not a bunch of folks up at a state capitol telling her what to do, as though she doesn't know what's in her own best interest and they know better. Come on.
And it is my pledge to you, when Congress passes a bill to restore the protections and reproductive freedom nationwide, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly sign it into law. Yes, I will. Yes, I will.
So much is on the line in this election.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Love you!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So much is on — I love you back. (Applause.) And listen, so much — so much is on the line in this election.
And we have to remember, this is not 2016 or 2020; the stakes are even higher, because a few months ago, the United States Supreme Court just told the former president that he would be essentially immune —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — from anything he does while he's in office.
Now, just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails, right?
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He — he who has vowed, if reelected, that he will be a dictator on day one.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. He who has called for the, quote, ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well — well — well —
AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
Because see, here's the thing, the courts will handle that. Let's handle November, shall we? (Applause.) We'll handle November. We'll handle November.
And we are clear. Look, anybody who says they would terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. (Applause.) Never again. Never again. Never again.
And so, after all these years, we know who Donald Trump is. He is someone who will stop at nothing to claim power for himself.
And you don't have to take my word for it. I've said for a while now: Watch his rallies, listen to his words. He tells us who he is, and he tells us what he would do if he is elected president. So, here tonight, I will show you one example of Donald Trump's worldview and intentions.
Please roll the clip.
(A video is played.)
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So — so, you heard him — so, you heard his words. You heard his words coming from him. He's talking about the enemy within Pennsylvania. He's talking about the enemy within our country, Pennsylvania. He's talking about that he considers anyone who doesn't support him or who will not bend to his will an enemy of our country.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's a serious issue. He's saying — he is saying that he would use the military to go after them. Think about this.
And — and we know who he would target. And we know he — who he would target because he has attacked them before: journalists whose stories he doesn't like, election officials who refuse to cheat by filling extra votes and finding extra votes for him, judges who insist on following the law instead of bending to his will.
This is among the reasons I believe so strongly that a second Trump term would be a huge risk for America and dangerous. (Applause.)
Donald Trump — Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged — (applause) — and he is out for unchecked power. That's what he's looking for. He wants to send the military after American citizens. He — he has worked to prevent women from making their own health care decisions and threatened your fundamental freedoms and rights like the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.)
So, here in Pennsylvania, I say to those who know best: When freedom is on the line, Americans always answer the call. We always answer the call. (Applause.)
And in this election —
AUDIENCE: Vote! Vote! Vote!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Vote. Vote.
And so, to your point, in this election, we will answer the call again, because it all comes down to this. We are all here together because we know what's at stake, and we are here together because we love our country. We love our country. We love our country. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. That's right. We love our country. And — and I do believe one of the highest forms of patriotim — patriotism that there is — one of the highest forms of patriotism is to fight for the ideals of our country. (Applause.) That is borne out of love of country to fight to realize the promise of America.
So, Election Day is in 22 days — 22 days. And here in Pennsylvania, early voting has already started. (Applause.) Yep. And, Erie County, you are a pivot county. (Applause.) How you all vote —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And — and thank you, because how you all vote in presidential elections often ends up predicting the national result. (Applause.) Yeah. Yes.
AUDIENCE: Erie! Erie! Erie!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: The chant is ""Erie."" ""Erie."" (Laughs.) That's right.
And so, in Erie County, you can vote early in person at the Erie County Voter Registration Office — (applause) — from now until Tuesday, October 29th. And so, now is the time to make your plan to vote.
And if you have already received your ballot in the mail, please do not wait. Fill it out and return it today or tomorrow, but please get it out.
And remember the deadline to register to vote in Pennsylvania is Monday, October 21st. So, if you or anyone you know has not yet registered, now is the time because, look, the election is here and we need to organize. We need to mobilize. We need to energize folks. And we need to remind everybody that their vote is their voice, and your voice is your power. (Applause.)
So, Erie, I ask you, then, are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President During an ""iHeartRadio"" Watch Party in Detroit, Michigan
  


  

  
    October 15, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Aw. Well, let me thank Tommy — that's my T-shirt? (Applause.) ""Detroit vs. Everybody,"" I'm with that. (Applause.) All right.
I want to thank everybody so very much. Tommy (inaudible), thank you for also this incredible — I — I just love this saying: ""Detroit vs. Everybody."" Because, you know, I — I was sharing with some folks, when I got to Howard, when I went to college, coming from Oakland — and my immediate, fast friends were from Detroit. (Laughter.) So, before I even knew anything, I knew about that Cass Tech, I knew about — (applause).
And I just feel a kindred spirit whenever I come to Detroit. But to have the support and the hard work of all the leaders who are here means so much. And I just — I thank you. I thank you.
Look, we have 21 days until this election. (Applause.) We will win. (Applause.) We will win. But — thank you both. It — it's going to be hard work, though. It's a tight race.
But here's the thing that I know about everybody that's here: We like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. And there is so much at stake.
I just finished doing Charlamagne's show. And, you know, we talked about a lot of issues, but there's so much about this election — and, by the way, early voting, everybody knows, it starts in four days in here Michigan, and Detroit is going to help deliver Michigan, by the way. (Applause.) And Michigan is going to help us win. (Applause.)
There is so much about this election and what is in front of us with this election that really is about two different paths and two different visions. And ours really is about the future, and the other side really is about trying to take us backward.
And — and what I want to say about the slogan ""Detroit vs. Everybody,"" about the heart and soul that I know about Detroit: This is a town of people who have grit, who have determination, and who have optimism and ambition and apply to that a lot of hard work, which makes Detroit a first-class city in the United States of America now and always has. (Applause.)
And so, I am honored to be with everybody and to work with you with what we need to do over these next days. And, yes, it includes supporting our entrepreneurs.
You know, I was talking to Charlamagne about it. I think you guys had a viewing thing here, right?
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, you know, a part of my — my feeling about it is that, look, we are a nation of people who have ambition, who have aspirations, who have dreams. And — and we need to tap into that, knowing that not everybody necessarily has the opportunity to actually achieve their goals but not for lack of innovation and ideas and hard work and grit.
So, a lot of my vision for what we need to do as we move forward as a new generation of leadership for America is about making sure that people have access to opportunity, which is why a big part of my plan is to build what I call an ""opportunity economy,"" which includes, for homeownership, giving people who are first-time homeowners a $25,000 down — down payment assistance to be able to buy their first home; which is why I know when I look at the tax code, a $5,000 deduction for startup companies, for small businesses is not enough for anybody to start up a small business in 2024, and I'm extending it to $50,000 to give people that opportunity, which is why I know in building an opportunity economy for young parents what we don't lack for families and individuals who have a natural desire to parent their children well but not always the resources to do it.
So, I will extend the Child Tax Credit to $6,000 — (the vice president is handed a new handheld microphone to replace a malfunctioning microphone) — and get a new mic in the process — (laughter and applause) — thank you — to be able — $6,000 Child Tax Credit, which for the first year of that child's life helps that young family buy a car seat, a crib — things for that child that get them on the path to where we know they will succeed.
And, you know, it's interesting because — because when we talked on the show just now, he — we talked about the fact that — you know, I — I think about the economy in a way that is about uplifting people, but it is not to the exclusion of also knowing what strengthens America's economy overall.
So, when I talk about extending the Child Tax Credit, giving people down payment assistance for the first-time homebuyers, helping our small businesses start up a small business and grow —
When I think about these things, it is, yes, thinking about individuals who just need the opportunity, but also it's about growing America's economy overall, which is why I am clear and the best economists in our country are clear that my plan, compared to Donald Trump's, will strengthen our economy. His will weaken it. My plan will strengthen our economy. He's — his will exasperate inflation. His will invite a recession by the middle of next year.
So, where we stand in this election is about focusing on the future of our nation, but it's also about building up the strength of our nation.
And so, I'll end with this. This is going to be a hard race. We are going to win. And part of the way we are going to win is, over these next 21 days, doing the work that you all are committed to doing, which is why you have taken the time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon. We're going to do the work.
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's about knocking on doors and calling people and emailing and reminding them of the power that the people possess to determine the future of our country.
Ours is a campaign that is about fuel from the power of the people and about building community and building coalitions and, in the process, building up our country to maximize our strength and our potential.
And I thank everybody here for your — for your hope, for your prayers, for your support, for your hard work. And I look forward to seeing you out in all of these beautiful neighborhoods that are Detroit as we do the work of bringing home a victory. (Applause.) Thank you. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania
  


  

  
    October 16, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi, everyone. (Applause.) Hi. Hi, everyone. Good afternoon. (Applause.) Good afternoon, Pennsylvania. Good afternoon, everyone. (Applause.) Good afternoon.
Bob and Kristina, thank you so very much for that introduction and for your friendship. And as I've said to all the friends and leaders on the stage with me — we had a chance to speak ahead of time — I thank you all for everything that you are doing and the courage you are showing.
You know, this is an extraordinary climate right now and — and I think we all recognize the — the courage that you are each showing to speak out so publicly and to put — as we are saying, because we truly believe it — country over party. So, thank you all.
And can we please applaud — (applause) — Bob and Kristina and all of the folks on the stage. Please. Thank you. Thank you. Truly. Truly. Thank you. (Applause.)
So, if you all have a seat, please do sit. (Laughs.) Yes.
So, as I think everyone here knows, we meet in a place that holds a very special meaning for our country. Here, on Christmas night, 1776, General George Washington and over 2,000 troops crossed the icy Delaware River in darkness, then marched to Trenton, where they surprised an outpost of enemy soldiers and achieved a major victory in the American Revolution.
And after we won the war and achieved our independence, delegates from across the nation gathered not far from here in Philadelphia to write and to sign the Constitution of the United States. (Applause.)
And we remember and reflect on what that moment was, knowing that leading up to that, that work to write, to compose the Constitution of the United States — that work was not easy.
The founders often disagreed, often quite passionately, but in the end, the Constitution of the United States laid out the foundations of our democracy, including the rule of law, that there would be checks and balances, that we would have free and fair elections, and a peaceful transfer of power. (Applause.)
And these principles and traditions have sustained our nation for over two centuries — sustained because generations of Americans from all backgrounds, from all beliefs, have cherished them, upheld them, and defended them. And now the baton is in our hands.
So, I am joined today by over 100 Republican leaders from across Pennsylvania and across our country — (applause) — who are supporting my candidacy for president of the United States, and I am deeply honored to have their support.
Some served in state houses, some in the United States Congress. Some worked for other Republican presidents and presidential nominees, including Mitt Romney, John McCain, George W. Bush, George H.W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan. (Applause.) And some, today, served in Donald Trump's own administration.
We also have with us Republican voters from here in Pennsylvania and beyond who have been active in their Republican parties for years, who have supported Republican candidates up and down the ticket.
Now, I say all that to make an obvious point. In a typical election year — (laughter) — you all being here with me might be a bit surprising — dare I say, unusual. But not in this election — not in this election. Because at stake in this race are the democratic ideals that our founders and generations of Americans before us have fought for. At stake in this election is the Constitution of the United States it very self.
We are here today because we share a core belief that we must put country before party. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Indeed. Because we cha- — and we chant that with such great pride, because we all know we all have so much more in common than what separates us. (Applause.)
And at some point in the career of the folks who join me on stage, one of the other things that we have in common is, in our careers, we have each sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States. (Applause.)
And so, we know that sacred oath must always be honored and never violated, and that we should expect anyone who seeks the highest office in our land would meet that standard.
We here know the Constitution is not a relic from our past but determines whether we are a country where the people can speak freely and even criticize the president without fear of being thrown in jail or targeted by the military — (applause); where the people can worship as they choose, without the government interfering — (applause); where you can vote without fear that your vote will be thrown away. (Applause.)
All of this and more depends on whether or not our leaders honor their oath to the Constitution. I have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution six times, including as vice president, as a United States senator, and as the top law enforcement officer of the largest state in our country. (Applause.)
And I have never wavered from upholding that oath. And this is a profound difference between Donald Trump and me — he who violated the oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and, make no mistake, he who, if given the chance, will violate it again.
Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. (Applause.) And he refused to accept the will of the people and the results of a free and fair election.
He sent a mob — an armed mob — to the United States Capitol, where they violently assaulted police officers, law enforcement officials, and threatened the life of his own vice president. And he refused to engage in the peaceful transfer of power.
Were it not for the courage and patriotism of Vice President Pence that day, Donald Trump might have actually succeeded in overturning the will of the American people. Let's reflect on that.
And now Donald Trump is telling us how he intends to use power if he is elected again. He has stated that one of the biggest threats America faces is, quote, ""the enemy from within"" — the —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — ""the enemy from within.""
But know where that language hearkens back to. Understand and let us be clear about what he is saying. He considers any American who doesn't support him or bend to his will to be an enemy to our country.
And further, he says that, as commander in chief, he would use our military to go after them. Honestly, let that sink in: use of the American military to go after American citizens.
And we know who he would target first, because he has at- — targeted them and attacked them before: journalists whose stories he doesn't like, nonpartisan election officials who refuse to cheat by finding extra votes for him, judges who insist on following the law instead of following him.
It is clear Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged. (Applause.) And he is seeking unchecked power.
Consider what his closest advisers have said. His national security advisor, two defense secretaries, his former chief of staff, his own vice president all have warned America, Donald Trump is unfit to serve. Or listen to General Milley, Donald Trump's top general. He has called Trump, and I quote, ""fascist to the core,"" and said, quote, ""No one has ever been as dangerous to this country.""
So, think about that. General Milley served in uniform for more than 40 years, commanding American forces around the world. He has confronted some of America's worst enemies. And he is saying no one has ever been as dangerous to our country as Donald Trump.
America must heed this warning, because anyone who tramples on our democratic values, as Donald Trump has; anyone who has called for the, quote, ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States, as Donald Trump has, must never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. (Applause.) Never again. Never again.
And to those — and to those who are watching, if you share that view, no matter your party, no matter who you voted for last time, there is a place for you in this campaign. (Applause.) The coalition we have built has room for everyone who is ready to turn the page on the chaos and instability of Donald Trump.
And I pledge to you to be a president for all Americans. (Applause.) And I take that pledge seriously. I take that pledge quite seriously.
So, as I've mentioned, many of you know, I spent a career as a prosecutor, in law enforcement. And I will tell you, I never asked a victim or a witness, ""Are you a Republican, or are you a Democrat?"" I never asked of anyone who needed help, if anyone who deserved attention, where were they registered and who did they vote for. The only question I ever asked was, ""Are you okay?""
And that is the k- — the kind of president I pledge to you that I will be. (Applause.) That is my pledge to you. Because we have too much to do and too much good work to do to be relegated to — to requiring each of us to be in some silo, disconnected from each other. There's too much good to be done.
And the challenges that we face as a nation require us — if we truly want to create solutions and strengthen our nation, the approach truly requires that we understand we're all in this together. This is so much more than rhetoric or a campaign. (Applause.) It really is about tapping into the spirit of who we are as Americans, because we are all in this together. We are all in this together.
And so, I pledge to be a president who actively works to unite us around our highest aspirations. I pledge to b- — you to be a president who is realistic and practical and has common sense and to always fight for the American people — (applause) — unlike Donald Trump, who, frankly, as we have seen, cares more about running on problems than fixing problems.
I want to fix problems, which means working across the aisle. It requires working across the aisle. It requires embracing good ideas from wherever they come.
That is why I have pledged to appoint a Republican in my Cabinet. (Applause.) That is why I have pledged to establish a council on bipartisan solutions to recommend to me commonsense solutions to some of the most pressing issues facing our country. (Applause.) Because nobody has a corner on the good ideas. (Laughter.) They actually come from many places.
And one should — especially if they want to be a leader, one should welcome those ideas — (applause) — and those ideas which are about, in particular, strengthening the middle class, securing our border, defending our freedoms, and maintaining our leadership in the world. (Applause.)
And all of this is to also say that I believe, for America to be the world's strongest democracy, we must have a healthy two-party system. (Applause.) Because it is when we have a healthy two-party system that leaders are then required to debate the merits of policy and to work, yes, across the aisle regularly and routinely to get things done.
And I have experienced firsthand how important and rewarding that kind of bipartisan cooperation can be. So, I'll tell you. When I was a United States senator, I served on the Senate Intelligence Committee. It was actually my favorite committee for a number of reasons but specifically this. There, we dealt with some of the most pressing issues affecting national security. There, we would talk about hot spots around the world and what we needed to do to focus on keeping America safe and secure. And to do that, we would review classified information, which required us to meet in a secure room. Adam, you know, it's called a SCIF. (Laughter.) Okay.
When we would go in that room, with all due respect, no cameras were allowed — (laughter) — no press. And we would roll up our sleeves and get to work. I'm telling you, senators of both parties would walk in that room, take off their suit jackets, roll up their sleeves, have a cup of coffee on the table, and we would have real conversations — real conversations, as Americans, because we understood that what happened in that room, well, the stakes were so high. And therefore, it could not be — we could not afford to let it be about whether one was a Democrat or a Republican. The stakes were too high.
We were in that room, and it was all about us as Americans, about doing what is in the best interest of the safety and security of our nation. I loved that work.
And it was what we have as the theme of today. It was country over party in action — in action. (Applause.)
So, I know it can be done. And that is the standard of leadership and the aspiration that I have in terms of how we will work when, with your help, I am elected president of the United States. (Applause.) So —
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, thank you. Thank you.
So —
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Got to get to work. We got to get to work. (Laughter.)
So, let me just say an obvious point. There's a fundamental choice in this election, a very fundamental choice: a choice between the leadership that I pledge to offer to America — leadership that brings folks together, that builds consensus and focuses on making life better for you, with the knowledge that we have so much more in common than what separates us; and on the other hand, the choice of someone who I think we can guarantee will sit in the Oval Office plotting retribution, stew in his own grievances, and think only about himself and not you.
So, as I have said, our campaign is not a fight against something; it is a fight for something. (Applause.)
It is a fight for the fundamental principles upon which we were founded. It is a fight for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can achieve together — Republicans, Democrats, and independents who want to move past the politics of division and blame and get things done on behalf of the American people.
And when it all comes down to it, I know we are all here together this beautiful afternoon because we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country.
And — and we are here because we know the deep privilege and pride that comes with being an American and the duty that comes along with it — (applause) — and the duty that comes along with it.
Imperfect though we may be, America is still that shining city upon a hill that inspires people around the world. (Applause.) And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. (Applause.)
So, to people from across Pennsylvania and across our nation, let us together stand up for the rule of law, for our democratic ideals, and for the Constitution of the United States. And in 20 days, we have the power to chart a new way forward, one that is worthy of this magnificent country that we are all blessed to call home.
Thank you all. May God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)
Thank you all. Thank you all. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in La Crosse, Wisconsin
  


  

  
    October 17, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Wisconsin! (Applause.) Hi, everyone. Oh. (Applause.)
Can we hear it for Cisco? (Applause.)
Good afternoon, Wisconsin. Good afternoon. (Applause.) Oh, it's wonderful to be back and here at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. Thank you all. (Applause.) Go Eagles! (Laughs.) (Applause.) Oh, it's good to meet everyone.
And, Mark Cuban, thank you for all that you are and being a partner in this. (Applause.) Thank you.
So, some of you may know, when I was five years old, we lived in Wisconsin. (Applause.) My parents taught at the University of Wisconsin in Madison for a time. And every now — every time I come now, when I land, Governor Evers will greet me, and he'll say, ""Welcome home."" (Applause.) So, it is good to be back in Wisconsin. (Laughs.)
And this is a room full of leaders, and I thank you all for taking the time out of your busy lives to be here to have this conversation.
I want to thank Mayor Reynolds. Thank you for the warm welcome and all you do. (Applause.)
And, La Crosse, let's reelect someone who has spent her career fighting for the families of Wisconsin: your senator, Tammy Baldwin. (Applause.) We need her in Washington. We need her in Washington. Good.
So, Election Day is in 19 days — (applause) — 19 days. And — and if — anyone, if you all have a chair or a seat, please do seat — sit, for anyone who has a chair. Okay? (Laughter.)
So, listen, we are nearing the home stretch, and this is going to be a tight race until the very end. And we —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You got this!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We got this. (Applause.) I see you.
And — and reality check: We are the underdog. Okay? And that's why I'm here with you, and you are taking the time to do the hard work that is necessary. It's why I'm campaigning for every vote, because I want and intend to be a president for all Americans — (applause) — and no matter their political party, where they live, or where they get their news. Okay? (Laughter and applause.)
And on that point, last night, you may have seen I went on Fox News. (Applause.) And while I was doing that, Donald Trump was at a Univision town hall where a voter asked him about January 6th.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay. So, now, we here know January 6th was a tragic day. It was a day of terrible violence. There were attacks on law enforcement. A hundred and forty law enforcement officers were injured; some were killed.
And what did Donald Trump say last night about January 6th? He called it a — quote, ""a day of love.""
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But — but it points out something that everyone here knows. The American people are exhausted with his gaslighting — (applause) — exhausted with his gaslighting. Enough.
We are ready to turn the page. (Applause.) Let's turn the page. We're done.
And, Wisconsin —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I'll — (laughs). And we're not going back, because this election — (laughs) —
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we are not going back because we know that this election is about two very different visions for our nation: one that has focused his on the past and ours that is focused on the future. (Applause.)
As represented by everyone here, and especially the students who are here right now — (applause) — yeah, you guys. You guys. Yeah. Yeah. It's about you guys. It really is. It really is.
And we know that America is ready for a new way forward. (Applause.) We are ready for a new and optimistic generation of leadership — (applause) — which is why Democrats and independents and Republicans are supporting our campaign.
In fact, just yesterday, I was with over 100 Republican leaders from across the country who joined me on the campaign trail. (Applause.) Really. And as they said, it was about putting country before party. And some of them served in Donald Trump's previous administration — the people who know him best. Okay?
And I believe, and I think we all know, Americans want a president who works for all the American people. (Applause.) It's what we deserve. And that has been the story of my entire career.
In my career, I've only ever had one client: the people. (Applause.) When I was a young courtroom prosecutor, I stood up for women and children against predators. As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks, fought to deliver $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure. I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by for-profit colleges. (Applause.) I stood up for workers who were being cheated out of the wages they were due, stood up for seniors facing elder abuse.
And I promise, as president, I will always fight for all the American people. And together — together, we can and we will build a future — a brighter future for our nation. That's why we're all here together. We love our country. (Applause.)
Together, we will build, in that future, what I call an opportunity economy, which is where every American has an opportunity to own a home, to start a business, to build wealth. Under my plan — and I know this is a big deal for the young people here — we will bring down the cost of housing. (Applause.) Because there was a time that generations of Americans could count on the American dream, but for far too many these days, it is just out of reach.
So, we will deal with the housing supply. And I will commit to creating a $25,000 down payment assistance so you can, for the first-time homebuyers, just get your foot in the door. (Applause.)
We will help entrepreneurs and sm- — small businesses to begin and grow because we know small businesses are part of America's backbone in terms of the strength of our economy.
You know, the woman who helped raise my sister and me was a small-business owner. I know — are we — do we have small-business owners who are here? Raise your hand. (Applause.) Yeah. You are not only business leaders; you are civic leaders, you are community leaders, and you really are part of the backbone of America's economy, and we've got to invest in you and make your jobs easier. (Applause.)
My plan will help expand Medicare to cover home health care for seniors. (Applause.) And this is personal for me.
So, part of you may know — part of — some of you may know that, when my mother was sick, I — I took care of her. And for anybody who has taken care of an elder parent when they are in their time of need, the work includes trying to cook something that they feel like eating — right? — helping them put on a sweater, trying to make them just laugh from time to time. Right? It's about dignity. It's about dignity. (Applause.)
But for far too many people, including people in the sandwich generation, who are raising young children and taking care of a parent — oh, it's so rough. And so, my plan is this. It's to say, instead of how it currently is, which is, in order for you to be able to get help to come in, you're going to have to pretty much get rid of all your savings to qualify for Medicaid — what I'm saying is, no, this is a matter of dignity and it is a matter of your ability to participate in the workforce and be productive and have a quality of life.
So, we're going to change the system so Medicare will cover your ability to have home health care for your elder parent. (Applause.) Because, you see, part of the difference between the way we see our country and the world and the way my opponent sees it is we actually see real people and care about them — (applause) — and have a sense of understanding about how tough times can be but how good times can be if we put the work into solving problems instead of trying to run on problems, like Donald Trump. (Applause.)
And so, that's why we will also lower costs on everything from health care to groceries, including taking on corporate price gouging, which I've done before and I will do again. (Applause.)
And we will give a middle-class tax cut to 100 million Americans, including $6,000 for young parents for star- — parents who are just starting out during the first year of their child's life, knowing the vast majority of our parents have a natural desire to parent their children well but not always the resources to do it. And so, this is about helping folks out to be able to buy a car seat and a crib just during that most critical phase of their child's development.
This is all about dignity, and this is about understanding. (Applause.)
And so, I share this to say I will always put the middle class and working families first. It's where I come from, and I will never forget where I come from. (Applause.) I will never forget where I come from.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Now, Donald Trump has a different plan.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I love you back, by the way. Thank you. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
Donald Trump has a different plan. So, just google Project 2025.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Now we're at a — a place of higher learning, so I must say — (laughter) — I can't believe they put that thing in writing. I really can't. (Laughter and applause.) They — they put it in writing. They bound it. Like, they bound it and handed it out.
So, look, we read it, right? It's a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president.
You know, I said many times — you've heard me say — Donald Trump is an unserious man, and the consequences of him ever getting his foot back in the Oval Office are brutally serious — brutally serious. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, Donald Trump — right? — that's why we're here together, and we — we're here because we know we got work to do still.
Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He will cut Social Security and Medicare.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He will get rid of the $35 cap on insulin for seniors.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He will make it easier for companies to — check this out — he will make it easier for companies to deny overtime pay for workers —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and will impose what I have named a ""Trump sales tax,"" because, essentially, he plans on putting a 20 percent tax, if not higher, on everyday basic necessities, which economists have estimated will cost the average American $4,000 more a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on top of all of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he has no plan to replace it.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: ""Concepts""!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You guys watched the debate. (Laughter.) He has, quote, ""concepts of a plan"" — ""concepts"" — ""concepts."" (Laughter.)
So, here's the thing. Again, it's a serious issue, right? So, he's going to threaten the health insurance coverage of 45 million people in America based on a concept —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — taking us back to when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was? Well, we are —
AUDIENCE: Not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — not going back. (Applause.) (Laughs.) We are not going back. We are not going back. (Laughs.) We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back, and just like Wisconsin's state motto tells us, we will move —
AUDIENCE: Forward!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — forward. (Applause.) We will move forward.
Because ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom — for freedom — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
Right. I see you. Thanks.
And, again, we're not going to be gaslighted on this. We remember Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court wi- —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Lies. Lies. That's a lie.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Oh, you guys are at the wrong rally. (Laughter and applause.) No, I think you meant to go to the smaller one down the street. (Applause.) (Laughs.) Come on.
So — but back to the matter at ha- — we need a medic here. We need a medic. We — right here, and then pr- — let's part the way so someone can come through and bring help.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: She's okay.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Sh- — okay? Okay. All right. We're good.
So, on the subject of his intention and what he actually did to undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, let's understand what has happened since. It is now the case that, in America, one in three women live in a state with a Trump abortion ban. Many — many of these bans have no exception even for rape or incest.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And you react that way because we understand the idea that someone who calls themselves a leader would even make no exceptions for a survivor of a violation to their body, and to tell that survivor they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next, that's immoral. That's immoral. It's immoral. (Applause.)
And I know we all agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do. (Applause.) If she chooses, she will talk with her priest — if she chooses, she will talk with her priest or her pastor, her rabbi, her imam but not the government telling her what to do.
And it is my pledge to you that when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law — (applause) — proudly — proudly sign it into law.
So —
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Lots of work — lots of work to do.
So, listen, so much is on the line in this election. You all know that. Again, that's why you're here.
And this is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher, because a few months ago, the United States Supreme Court told the former president he is effectively immune no matter what he does in the White House.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Now think about that. Think about that. Just imagine Donald Trump with no guard rails. Right? He who has vowed, if reelected, he will be a dictator on day one.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He who has called — he who has called for the, quote, ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States of America.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And let us be very clear: Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. (Applause.) Never again. Never again. Never again.
And then consider the comments that he made just in the last few days, because he just — he's got more. (Laughter.) He said he will target and punish those who disagree with him or refuse to bend to his will. He calls these Americans ""the enemy within"" —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and says that he would use the American military to go after American citizens: journalists whose stories he doesn't like, nonpartisan election officials who refuse to cheat by finding a few extra votes for him, judges who insist on following the law instead of following him.
It is for reasons like these that General Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — Donald Trump's top general — has called Trump, and I quote, ""fascist to the core."" (Applause.)
And it is clear Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged and will stop at nothing to claim unchecked power for himself. He wants to send the military after American citizens. He wants to prevent women from making decisions about their own body. He wants to threaten fundamental freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, to breathe clean air and drink clean water, and the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.)
So much is on the line in this election. So much is on the line.
And, Wisconsin, when it comes down to it, look, we are all here together because we know what is at stake. We are all here together because we love our country. (Applause.) And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to then fight for the ideals of our country and fight — Cisco, you said it — to realize the promise of America — (applause) — the promise of America.
So, Election Day is in 19 days. And here in Wisconsin, early voting starts next Tuesday, October 22nd. (Applause.) So, now is the time to make your plan to vote. And if you have received your ballot — if you have received your ballot in the mail, please do not wait. Fill it out and return it today.
And remember that Wisconsin has same-day voter registration, right? (Applause.) So, if you are not registered to vote, you can register when you vote. And please do vote early or on election day because the election is — and bring an ID — (laughs) — (applause) — because the election is here.
And, listen, I'm telling everybody what you already know and have been doing. We've got to energize. Let's mobilize. Let's organize. Let's — let's continue in this process, also, to do what everyone here is doing: Let's build community. (Applause.) You know? Let's — let's build coalitions.
Let's remind each other that we are all in this together. Let's remind each other we have so much more in common than what separates us. (Applause.)
And let's do all this knowing that our vote is our voice, and your voice is your power. (Applause.)
So, Wisconsin, today, I then ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win. (Applause.)
God bless you. God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin
  


  

  
    October 17, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Can we hear it for Jim? (Applause.) Good evening, Wisconsin! (Applause.) Good evening, everyone.
Hey, Jim, thank you. Can we hear it for Jim again? (Applause.)
Oh, it's good to be back. Hey, everybody. Hey, Green Bay. (Applause.) Hi, everybody.
Hey, so, many of you may know, when I was five years old, we lived in Wisconsin. (Applause.) My ch- — my parents taught for a short time here. And now, every time I land, Governor Evers will meet me, and he'll say, ""Welcome home."" (Laughs.) (Applause.)
So — but it's so good to be back with everyone. And thank you all for taking the time out of your busy lives to be here this evening. Thank you all. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
And it's great to be with just this incredible group of leaders, including, of course, Ben Wikler, chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party. (Applause.) There he is — Ben.
Kristin Lyerly, who we need to send to the United States Congress. (Applause.)
And, Green Bay, let's reelect someone who has spent her career fighting for Wisconsin families and manufacturing right here in Wisconsin, your senator, Tammy Baldwin. (Applause.) We need her back in D.C.
We are also joined by tribal leaders, including President Holsey, who is here from the Stockbridge-Munsee Band, the Mohican Indians. (Applause.)
And I will say, Madam President, that I strongly believe that the relationship between Tribal nations and the United States is sacred, and that we must honor Tribal sovereignty — (applause); embrace trust and treaty obligations; and ensure tribal self-determination. And as president, I will defend those principles. (Applause.)
All right, Green Bay. So, Green Bay, we have 19 days until Election Day — 19 days. So, we are entering the homestretch — (applause) — and this is going to be a tight race until the very end.
Look, we are the underdog, and that's why we are and I am campaigning to earn every single vote, because I intend to be a president for all Americans — (applause) — no matter their political party, where they live, or where they get their news. (Applause.)
On that point, last night, you may have seen that I went on Fox News. (Applause.) Meanwhile, Donald Trump joined a Univerge — a Univision town hall last — yesterday, where a voter asked him about January 6th.
Okay, now we here know January 6th was a tragic day — a tragic day for our country. It was a day of terrible violence, with attacks on law enforcement. A hundred and forty law enforcement officers were injured that day. Law enforcement officers were killed that day.
And what did Donald Trump say last night about January 6th? He called it quote, ""a day of love.""
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we are all clear, the American people are exhausted with his gaslighting — (applause) — exhausted. Enough. Enough. We are ready to turn the page. (Applause.) Turn the page.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. And the reason, Wisconsin, is because we know this election is about two very different visions for our country. One that is focused on the past, his. And, ours, that is focused on the future. (Applause.) On the future.
Because we know America is ready for a new way forward, ready for a new optimistic generation of leadership. (Applause.) All of us — it's all of us, which is why Democrats and Republicans and independents are supporting our campaign.
In fact, yesterday, over 100 Republican leaders from across the country joined me on the campaign trail — (applause) — including — including some who had previously served in Trump's administration. (Applause.) And I believe it is because America wants a president who will serve on behalf of all the American people. (Applause.) And that has been the story of my entire career.
My entire career, I've only ever had one client: the people — the people. (Applause.) As a young courtroom prosecutor, I stood up for women and children against predators. As an attorney general of California, I took on the big banks and fought to deliver $20 billion for middle-class families that faced foreclosure.
I stood up to veterans and stood up for — excuse me, stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for-profit colleges. You know, who else — who ran a big for-profit college? Let's not forget.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I stood up for those veterans and students who were being scammed by for-profit colleges that were trying to rip them from their dreams and charge them, producing nothing in return.
I have stood up for workers who have been cheated out of the wages they were due. I have stood up for seniors who were facing elder abuse.
And as president, I will always fight for the American people. (Applause.) I will always fight for the American people.
And together, we will build a brighter future for our nation. Together. (Applause.) And it's a future where we build what I call an ""opportunity economy,"" where America has an opportunity to do for our people, what we know is part of our ambition, our dreams, our aspirations — an opportunity economy where everyone has an opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business.
Under my plan, we will bring down the cost of housing — (applause) — including with a $25,000 down payment assistance so you can just get your foot in the door. (Applause.)
You'll do the hard work of saving up and paying that mortgage, but let's be honest. You know the American dream? Well, that was real for generations past, but not so much within the reach of people right now, and we got to deal with the real challenges that people are facing right now if we're going to invest in the future.
Part of my plan is about helping entrepreneurs start and grow small businesses. (Applause.) Look, my mother worked hard, and there was a woman who lived two doors down from us, our neighbor, who helped my mother raise us. She was a small-business owner. I know who our small business owners are.
You are not only business leaders; you are community leaders. You are civic leaders, and it is our small businesses who are the backbone of America's economy. I know that to be true. (Applause.) Do we have any small-business owners here tonight? Raise your hand. Yeah. (Applause.)
Under my plan, we will expand Medicare to cover home health care for seniors. Again, this is — (applause) — this is based on what I personally know.
So, look, when my mother was sick, I took care of her. And one of the things for anyone who was in that situation or has been, you know what it's like. It's about cooking for folks in a way that hopefully they'll want to eat. It's about trying to find the clothes that won't be too rough on their skin. It's about trying to, from time to time, think of something that can put a smile on their face or make them laugh. It's about dignity. It's about dignity. (Applause.)
But the reality is, it is expensive if you don't have the ability to do it. It is expensive to try and bring somebody in. And far too many people then have to quit their job to try and take care of their elder relatives, and that's not right. That's not right.
And so, we also know there are so many people in what we call the ""sandwich generation"" — right? — who are raising young children while you taking care of your parents, and it's almost impossible to do it all.
So, my point is this: Either, under the current system, you pay down and lose all your savings so you can qualify for Medicaid —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Woo! (Laughter.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — or — you know what I'm saying. Either you have to give it all up and — and — to be able to qualify for Medicaid, or you're going to have to quit your job or somehow figure out how you can afford to bring in help.
So, my plan is that, instead, we're going to have Medicare cover home health care for those who need it. (Applause.) Because the details matter. The details matter.
In an opportunity economy, here's how I see it, we must create good-paying jobs that are available to all Americans and not just those with college degrees. Okay? (Applause.)
Because here's the thing, a college degree is not the only measure of the skills and experience of a qualified worker. (Applause.) Which is why, as president, I will get rid of unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs, and I will challenge the private sector to do the same. (Applause.)
And we will lower costs on everything from health care to groceries and take on corporate price gouging. I've done it before, and I will do it again. (Applause.)
My plan will also give a middle-class tax cut to 100 million Americans, including $6,000 during the first year of your child's life. Because here's the thing, we know the vast majority of parents have a natural desire to parent their children well but not always the resources. And that shouldn't be the thing that gets in the way of giving a child all that we know parents have to give.
And the $6,000, by extending that Child Tax Credit, that's what's going to help you buy a crib or a car seat and all the things that that child needs during that most critical phase of their development.
And I share with you some of these details to say this: I will always put the middle class and working families first. (Applause.) I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. (Applause.) Never. Never.
Now, Donald Trump has a different plan.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Just google ""Project 2025."" You know, I mean, I keep saying this, but I can't believe they put that thing in writing. (Laughter.) You know, I just — and they didn't just put it in writing. They bound it, and then they handed it out. (Laughter.)
And if you read it, look, it's a detailed — it's a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president. You know, many of you have heard me say, I do believe that Donald Trump is an unserious man, but the consequences of him being president again are brutally serious — brutally serious. Because here's the thing, Donald Trump will give tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations, just like he did before. He will cut Social Security and Medicare and get rid of the $35 cap on insulin for seniors.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Check this out, when you — when you look at Project 2025, he will make it easier for companies to deny overtime pay for workers.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he will impose what I call a ""Trump sales tax,"" which is at least a 20 percent tax on everyday basic necessities, which economists have estimated will cost the average American over $4,000 more a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on top of all of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and he has no plan to replace it.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: He has concepts!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So you watched the debate. (Laughs.)
He has, quote, ""concepts of a plan."" ""Concepts of a plan.""
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Come on.
But, again, it's a serious issue, because here's the thing. He's going to then threaten health insurance coverage for 45 million Americans based on a concept and take us back to when insurance companies were denying people with preexisting conditions? You remember what that was?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, we are not going back. We are not going back. (Applause.) We are not going back. We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We're not going back.
And we are not going back, because just like Wisconsin's state motto tells us, we will move —
AUDIENCE: Forward!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — forward. (Applause.)
Because ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom — (applause) — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body — (applause) — and not have her government tell her what to do.
And no matter how he'd like to gaslight us, we are clear about how we got here: Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended. And now, in America, one in three women live in a state with a Trump abortion ban.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And you've heard the stories — awful stories, painful stories — of the experiences people have been having since that came down.
I mean, think about it. In some of these states there's no exception even for rape or incest, which means telling a survivor of a violation to their body that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. That's immoral. That's immoral.
And let us agree: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do — not the government. (Applause.)
And it is my pledge to you, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly sign it into law. Proudly.
That's why you got to get Tammy back to the Senate, by the way. Okay? (Applause.)
Now, Donald Trump has a very different view on reproductive freedom, and he refuses continuously — he refuses continuously to acknowledge the harm he has caused. See for yourself. Let's roll a clip.
(A video clip is played.)
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right?
AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Oh, okay, the courts will take care of that. Let's take care of November. (Laughs.) (Applause.) We'll take care of November.
Now, I mean, seriously, so first of all, no, Donald, everybody did not want Roe v. Wade to be overturned. Women are dying of sepsis because they cannot get the health care they need. They did not want this. Couples just trying to grow their family are being cut off in the middle of IVF treatments. They did not want this.
And now, I mean, it just gets more unbelievable sometimes. (Laughter.) And now, the man calls himself the ""father of IVF""? (Laughter.) I mean, what does that even mean? (Laughter.) And — and all of that — well, he is the one who, by the way, is responsible for it being at risk in the first place.
And what is sadly — what is sadly interesting, I think,
is that when you listen to Donald Trump talk, it becomes increasingly clear, I think, he has no idea what he's talking about when it comes to the health care of women
in America. (Applause.)
And across our nation — again, because this is serious, right? — you know, this is why you all are here and spending so much time when you could be doing other things.
Listen, across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other and additional hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote — you see what's happening around our country; attacks on the freedom to join a union; attacks on the freedom to just be safe from gun violence — (applause); attacks on the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.)
So much is on the line in this election. And this is not 2016 and it's not 2020. The stakes are even higher because, a few months ago, the Supreme Court told the former president that he is effectively immune no matter what he does in the White House.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Now, just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Think about that. He who has vowed, if reelected, he will be a dictator on day one —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — that he will weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. He who calls Americans who disagree with him the ""enemy from within,"" and — yes — and says that if reelected, he would use the military to go after them.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He — he who has called for the, quote, ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And let us be very clear. Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. (Applause.) Never again. Never again. Never again.
So, Wisconsin, it comes down to this. I know we are all here together because we know what is at stake, and we are here together because we love our country. (Applause.) We love — we love our country. (Applause.)
And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism, of an expression of the love of our country to then fight for its ideals and to fight to realize the promise of America, and that's what we are doing. (Applause.)
So, Election Day is in 19 days. (Applause.) And here in Wisconsin, early voting starts next Tuesday, October 22nd. (Applause.)
So, now is the time to make your plan to vote. And if you have received your ballot in the mail, please do not wait. Fill it out and return it today.
And remember, Wisconsin has same-day voter registration, so if — (applause) — right? — so if you are not registered to vote, you can register when you vote on Election Day or early.
Because, folks, the election is here, and so we know we need to organize. We need to energize. We need to mobilize. And we got to remind everybody: Your vote is your voice and your voice is your power. In a democracy, it still remains true that each individual has the power — each individual has the power to weigh in on this.
And so, Wisconsin, today I ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Grand Rapids, Michigan
  


  

  
    October 18, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, Michigan! Good afternoon. Can we hear it for Brian? (Applause.)
Good afternoon, Michigan. It is good — (applause) — oh, it is good to be back. It's good to be back. (Applause.) Good afternoon. Oh — (laughs) — oh, my god. Okay. (Applause.) Okay. Thank you.
Okay, let's get to business. Let's get to business. Thank you. Thank you. I am very touched. (Applause.) Thank you all. Oh, it's good to be back. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.
Okay, let's get to work. Let's get to work. Let's get to work. Let's get to work.
So, let me first thank all of you for taking time out of your very busy lives for us to all be here together this afternoon. I thank you so very much for all you do, all you have done, and all you will do over these next 18 days. Thank you all so very much. (Applause.) Thank you.
This is an incredible group of incredible leaders, and your voice matters so much right now. And I think there is so much about our campaign that is about the spirit of reminding everyone that we're all in this together. We are all in this together. (Applause.) So, thank you.
And to all the governors who are here with us today — (applause) — I'm telling you, they're riding thick. They're riding thick. Oh, and they are all — each one of them — such incredible leaders, both for their state and our nation, and such dear friends. And I thank you all, including, of course, Michigan's own Governor Whitmer — (applause) — who we love as ""Big Gretch."" (Applause.)
And to the governors, I want to say you've been traveling the country for our campaign, and I'm so deeply grateful for your support.
I also want to recognize Senator Stabenow — (applause) — a champion for Michigan; Representative Scholten, who we will reelect to the United States Congress. (Applause.) And while we're at it, let's send Representative Slotkin to the United States Senate. (Applause.)
All right, so we got work to do. Eighteen day — eighteen days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. And as you know, everyone here knows, this election is truly about two very different visions for our nation: Ours that is focused on the future; Donald Trump's that is focused on the past. Ours, that is focused on bringing down the cost of living for working families, investing in small businesses, and entrepreneurs. Ours, that is about protecting reproductive freedom. (Applause.)
But none of that is what we hear from Donald Trump. Instead, it is just the same old, tired playbook. He has no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people, and he is, as we have seen, only focused on himself.
And now he is ducking debates and canceling interviews.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Come on.
Check this out. His own campaign team recently said it is because of exhaustion. (Laughter.) Well, if you are exhausted on the campaign trail, it raises real questions about whether you are fit for the toughest job in the world. (Applause.) Come on. Come on.
So, for all these reasons and more, we are here because we know it is time to turn the page. (Applause.) It is time to turn the page because America is ready to chart a new way forward. (Applause.) America is ready for a new and optimistic generation of leadership that is all of us — (applause) — all of us, which is why Democrats, Republicans, and independents are supporting our campaign. (Applause.)
In fact, earlier this week, over 100 Republican leaders from across the country joined me on the campaign trail, including some who even served in Donald Trump's own administration — (applause) — the people who know him best, right?
And I believe all of this shows that the American people want a president who works for all the people. (Applause.) And that has been the story of my entire career. In my career, I've only ever had one client: the people — the people. (Applause.)
As a young courtroom prosecutor, I protected women and children. As attorney general of California, I fought for students and veterans. As vice president, I have stood up for workers and seniors. And as president, I will stand up for all Americans — all Americans. (Applause.)
And together, we will build a brighter future for our nation. Yes, we will. (Applause.) Because, by the way, we will win. (Applause.) We will win. We will win. Come on.
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) Yes, we will.
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We will win. We will win. And we will win.
And one of the reasons that we know we are working hard toward that win is because we believe together in building a future — in what we can do together as a nation — and a nation of people who see what we have in common more than what separates us.
We will w- — build towards a future where we have an economy that works for all Americans. We will build what I call an ""opportunity economy"" so that every American has an opportunity to own a home, buy a car, build wealth, and start a business. (Applause.)
In fact, do we have any small-business owners here? (Applause.) I love our small businesses. I got a plan for you. I love our small businesses. Our small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy. Bless you all for the work you are doing.
So, under my plan, we will also bring down the cost of housing — (applause) — and we will help entrepreneurs start and grow small businesses.
My plan will expand Medicare to cover the cost of home health care for our seniors — (applause) — so that more of our seniors can live with dignity.
And, you know, I'll just give you a little background i- — in terms of a personal story. So, I took care of my mother when she was sick. And for any of you who have taken care of an elder relative, you know what that is, right? It's about trying to cook something that they can eat. It's about trying to find clothes that they can — they can handle on their skin. It's about trying, from time to time, to think about something that will put a smile on their face or maybe just make them laugh. It's about dignity.
But under the current system, and especially for those in the sandwich generation who are raising young kids while you're taking care of your parents, it's difficult. And under the current system, to get help for taking care of your seniors, unless you got the extra money sitting around, you'd have to leave your job or pay down all your savings to qualify for Medicaid. That's not right. That's not right.
So, my plan is about saying, let's have Medicare cover the cost of home health care for our seniors — (applause) — which is a matter of understanding how real people are living and understanding the importance of everyone being entitled to dignity. (Applause.)
Our plan, in terms of an opportunity economy, will lower costs on everything from health care to groceries. I'll take on corporate price gouging, because I've done it before and I will do it again. (Applause.)
My plan will also give middle-class tax cuts to 100 million Americans, including $6,000 tax credit for the first year of a child's life so that our young parents — (applause) — can do what they naturally want to do, which is parent their children well, but they don't always have the resources to be able to do it. So, let's help them out so that they can buy a car seat, so that they can buy a crib, so that they can take care of that baby's needs during that critical phase of their development.
We all benefit from it. We all benefit from it. (Applause.)
Dignity.
My plan also invests in American manufacturing and innovation, because I will make sure America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. That's right.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And so, to that point and with pride, we all say: We must and we will invest in the industries that built America, like steel, iron, and the great American auto industry. (Applause.) And we will ensure that the next generation of breakthroughs, from advanced batteries to electric vehicles, are not just invented but built right here in America by American union workers. (Applause.)
And, Michigan, I know I'm going to tell you what you already know, but let us be clear for folks who are watching from different parts of the country. Contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive, but here is what I will do. I will invest in manufacturing communities like Kent County. (Applause.)
Together, we will retool existing factories, hire locally, and work with unions to create good-paying jobs — (applause) — including jobs that do not require a college degree, because here's where I come from. I know a college degree is not the only measure of the skills and experience of a qualified worker. (Applause.)
And I intend to reexamine federal jobs, when you all elect me president — (applause) — to assess those jobs that should not have that requirement, and then I intend to challenge the private sector to do the same. (Applause.)
Now, all of this is to say Donald Trump has a different approach. He makes big promises — (laughs) — and he always fails to deliver.
So, remember he said he was the only one — you know how he talks. (Laughter.) He — the only one who could bring back America's manufacturing jobs.
Then, America lost almost 200,000 manufacturing jobs when he was president.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Facts. Including tens of thousands of jobs right here in Michigan. And those losses started before the pandemic, making Donald Trump one of the biggest losers — (applause) — of manufacturing jobs in American history.
And his track record for the auto industry was a disaster. He promised workers in Warren that the auto industry would, and I'm going to quote, ""not lose one plant"" during his presidency. Those were his words, ""not one plant.""
Then American automakers announced the closure of six auto plants when he was president, including General Motors in Warren and Stellantis in Detroit. Thousands of Michigan autoworkers lost their jobs. And Donald Trump's running mate recently suggested that if they win, they would threaten the Grand River Assembly plant in Lansing. Okay?
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: The same plant our administration protected earlier this year, saving 650 union jobs — (applause) — 650 union jobs. His running mate called those ""table scraps.""
So, we fought hard for those jobs, and we believe that you deserve a president who will protect them and not insult them. (Applause.)
And make no mistake, Donald Trump is no friend of labor. Let's be really clear about that. No matter what the noise is out there, he is no friend of labor. Just look at the record. Instead of his rhetoric, look at the record. And let's not fall for the okey-doke. (Laughter.)
Seriously. He encouraged automakers to move their plants out of Michigan so he could pay — they could pay their workers less. Understand what that was about: so they could pay their workers less.
And when the UAW went on strike to demand the higher wages they deserved, Donald Trump went to a nonunion shop —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and attacked the UAW, and he said — he said, striking and collective bargaining don't make, quote, ""a damn bit of sense"" — ""a damn bit of difference"" is what he said exactly. That it doesn't make a, quote — pardon my language — ""a damn bit of difference,"" is what he said.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: He don't make a damn bit of sense. (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: All right, brother. (Laughs.)
So, Michigan, you know better. Strong unions mean higher wages — (applause) — better health care, and greater dignity for union members and for everyone, whether or not you are part of a union. (Applause.) Get that straight. Get that straight.
Which is why, when I am president, I will sign the PRO Act into law and make it easier for workers to join a union and negotiate for better pay and working conditions. (Applause.)
And now Donald Trump is making the same empty promises to the people of Michigan that he did before, hoping — hoping you will forget how he let you down the last time. But we will not be fooled, because we know how to read Project 2025. For those who haven't seen it, just google it.
You know, I just have to keep repeating, I can't believe they put that thing in writing. I cannot beli- — they — they put it in — they put it in writing. They bound it. They — they published it, and they handed it out. (Laughter.) And now they're trying to run from it. Come on.
And so, we've read it. It's a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what Donald Trump intends to do if he were elected president. So, that's why we know — not only because it's what he did before — that's why we know Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts, attack unions, cut Social Security and Medicare —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — get rid of that hard-fought, hard-won $35 cap on insulin for our seniors.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Check out what's in it. It will make it easier for companies to deny overtime pay for workers —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and impose what I call a ""Trump sales tax,"" which is basically — he's talking about at least a 20 percent tax on everyday necessities, which economists have measured will cost the average family nearly $4,000 more a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on top of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act — okay? — and has no plan to replace it.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: ""Concepts""!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You watched the debate. (Laughs.) So, you remember, he has, quote, ""concepts of a plan.""
AUDIENCE: ""Concepts of a plan!""
THE VICE PRESIDENT: ""Concepts of a plan.""
So, he's going to threaten — he's going to threaten the health insurance of 45 —
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We need a medic over here. We need a medic over here. Let's — let's clear a path so they can come through, please.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Don't forget he's out on bail!
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Espionage! (Laughter.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we got jokes over here, grounded in reality. (Laughter.)
We okay? Okay. We're okay. Thank you all.
So — (applause) — we're good. Okay.
So, you know, where I was going with that is many of you may have heard me say, I do believe that Donald Trump is an unserious man, and the consequences of him ever getting back into the White House are brutally serious — brutally serious.
So, on that point about ""concepts of a plan,"" it's funny. We thought it was ridiculously hilarious when we first heard it. But here's the thing about that. He is basically going to threaten the health insurance of 45 million people based on a concept and take us back to when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was like?
Well, we are —
AUDIENCE: Not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — not going back. We are not going back. We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are not going back. We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we are not going back because we intend to move forward — (applause) — because ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom — (applause) — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
And we here remember how we got to this place, because then-President Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended.
And now, in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many of these with no exception even for rape and incest, which means you're telling a survivor of a violation to their body that they don't have a right to make a decision about what happens to their body next?
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's immoral. That's immoral.
And I think we all know one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do — (applause) — not the government. If she chooses, she will talk to her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam but not the government — not some — some people up in a state capitol — not Donald Trump.
AUDIENCE: No!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: No.
So, let me tell you, when Congress passes a bill to restore the reproductive freedoms nationwide, with your help, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly. Proudly. Proudly.
And across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights — fundamental freedoms and rights. I'm traveling our country. I mean, attacks on the freedom to vote.
You know, in the state of Georgia, they passed a law that makes it illegal to give people food and water for standing in line to vote. You know, the hypocrisy abounds. What happened to ""love thy neighbor""? Right?
Attacks on the freedom to join a union, attacks on the freedom to be safe from gun violence, attacks on the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.)
So much is on the line in this election, and you all are spending your precious time here together because we know this is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher this time for many reasons, including because, just months ago, the United States Supreme Court basically told the former president he is effectively immune no matter what he does in the White House.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. Because we know — just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Just imagine. He who has vowed he would be a dictator on day one. He who calls Americans who disagree with him the ""enemy from within."" You know where that language comes from? The ""enemy from within,"" talking about Americans. He who says he would use the military to go after them — American citizens. He who has called for the, quote, ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States of America.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we are clear: Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again have the privilege of standing behind the seal of the president of the United States. (Applause.) Never again. Never again. Never again. Never again.
AUDIENCE: Never again! Never again! Never again!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Never again.
So, Michigan, it all comes down to this. We know why we're here together. We know what's at stake. And we are here together for one of the most important of all the reasons: We are here together because we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country.
We love our country, and we know that it is one of the highest forms of an expression of love of our country, of patriotism, to then fight for our ideals, to fight to realize the promise of America. That's what our campaign is about.
And Election Day is in 18 short days. Okay? And here in Michigan, early voting starts on Saturday, October 26th, which is one week from tomorrow. (Applause.)
So, now is the time to make your plan to vote. Make a plan. Make a plan. And if you have received your ballot in the mail, please do not wait. Fill it out and return it today.
Because, folks, the election is here. The election is here right now. And like I know everybody here knows to do, we've got to energize and organize and mobilize and remind our neighbors and our friends that their vote is their voice and your voice is your power.
In a democracy, while we can hold on to it, our vote is the power that each of us as an individual has. It's an extraordinary power, and we will not give it away, and we will not let anyone suppress or silence our power. Don't ever let anybody take your power from you. (Applause.)
So, Michigan, today I ask you, then, are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Oakland County, Michigan
  


  

  
    October 18, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good evening, Michigan! (Applause.) Can we hear it for Mia? (Applause.)
(The audience sings ""Happy Birthday to You."")
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. All right. Okay. Thank you. And we need to get to work. All right, thank you all.
It is so good to be back in Michigan. (Applause.) It is so good to be back. I want to thank everyone for taking the time out of your busy lives to take the time to be here this evening. I thank you all so very much. (Applause.)
Can we please hear it for Stab- — wait — can we please hear for Senator Stabenow, who was here earlier? (Applause.)
County Executive, Dave Coulter — (applause); Representative Stevens, who we need to elect to the United States Congress — (applause); and let's send Representative Slotkin to the United States Senate — (applause) — because we need them in D.C. We need them in D.C.
I also want to thank all of the leaders of the Arab American community who are here. (Applause.) As everyone know, this community has deep and proud roots in the Detroit metro area, and I am proud to have the support of Arab American leaders like Wayne County Deput- —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi, we need a medic. Okay, we need a medic. Let's figure out a way to part a little bit so that we can bring a medic in over here, please. Okay?
Okay, it looks like we need a medic over there, too. Is that what we're saying? Okay. Okay. We got a lot of folks in here. It's a little warm. Let's just make sure we're looking out for each other. Okay? (Applause.)
Okay. Are we okay? All right, it looks like we're good. We're okay? All right. Okay. Thank you.
And always, to our first responders, thank you for your work.
So, as I was saying, our Arab American community has deep and proud roots in the Detroit metro area, and I am very proud to have the support of Arab American leaders like Wayne County Deputy Executive Assad Turfe. (Applause.)
And listen, I know this year has been very difficult given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza and given the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon. It is devastating.
And now, Sinwar's death can and must be a turning point. (Applause.) Everyone must seize this opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza — (applause); bring the hostages home; and end the suffering once and for all. And I continue to believe diplomacy is the answer to bringing lasting stability across the Israel-Lebanon border.
And as vice president and, with your help, as president, I will do everything in my power to achieve these goals — (applause) — and work toward a future with security and dignity for all people in the region.
So, thank you all.
And, Michigan, listen, we got 18 days to get this done — 18 short days. And you all wouldn't be here spending your precious time here with all the other obligations you've got if you did not know this is probably one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. (Applause.)
And it's going to be a tight race until the very end, and we are the underdog and running as the underdog. But make no mistake, we will win. (Applause.) We will win. We will win. Yes, we will. We will win.
And we will win because we understand — and we will win because we understand what is at stake. This — this election is about two very different visions for our nation: one, Donald Trump's, that is focused on the past —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and the other — and the other, ours, that is focused on the future. (Applause.)
We are focused on a future where we bring down the cost of living, invest in small businesses and entrepreneurs, protect reproductive freedom. (Applause.)
That is in the future that we are fighting for. But as you all know, that's not what we're hearing from Donald Trump. Instead, it is the same old, tired playbook. He has no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people. No plan.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Concepts!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Can I hear it again? No plan.
AUDIENCE: No plan!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he is only focused on himself.
And now, check this out, he is ducking debates and canceling interviews.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You saw his own campaign team is saying it's because of exhaustion. All right, well, here's
the thing, if you are exhausted from the campaign trail, it raises real questions about you are fit for the toughest job in the world. (Applause.)
And so, folks, for these reasons and more, it is time to turn the page. (Applause.) Let's turn the page, because America is ready to chart a new way forward — (applause) — ready for a new and optimistic generation of leadership — (applause) — that is all of you; it's all of us — which is why Democrats, Republicans, independents are supporting our campaign.
In fact, you may have seen earlier this week, over 100 Republican leaders from across the country joined me on the campaign trail — (applause) — including some who served under Donald Trump's administration, because, you know, they know him best. They understand what's at stake.
And I believe Americans want a president and deserve a president who works for all the American people — all the American people. (Applause.)
And that has been, as you all know, the story of my entire career. I've only, in my career, had one client: the people. One client. (Applause.)
As a young courtroom prosecutor, I protected women and children. As attorney general of California, I fought for students and veterans who were being scammed by those for-profit colleges. (Applause.) As vice president, I have stood up for workers and seniors. And as president, I will fight for all the American people — always. (Applause.) Always.
And —
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And, together, us and you — we will together — like I want you to shout your own name for a minute. Let's do that really quickly. Shout your own name for a minute.
(The audience members shout their names.)
(Laughs.) That's what I'm talking about, because it's about your family. It's about you. That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about. Because together, we will build a brighter future for our nation. (Applause.) Together. Together.
A future where we build what I call an ""opportunity economy"" so that every American has an opportunity to own a home, buy a car, build wealth, start a business. (Applause.) Right?
Under my plan, we will deal with things like bringing down the cost of housing. (Applause.) We will help entrepreneurs start and grow a small business. Do we have any small-business owners here? (Applause.) Our small businesses are the backbone of America's economy. (Applause.)
My plan will expand Medicare to cover home health care for seniors. (Applause.) And look, as with so many of the issues that are priority issues for me, including small businesses, the issue of home health care —
Look, I'm going to just go off script for a moment. So, when my mother was — when my mother was sick, I took care of her. And for anyone here who has or is taking care of an older relative, you know what it is. It's about trying to cook something that they feel like eating. It's about trying to put some clothes on them that won't irritate their skin, right? It's about, from time to time, trying to figure out what you can say that will bring a smile to their face or make them laugh. It's about dignity. It's about dignity.
And here's the — here's the deal. When you look at everyone who is doing that and then you look at the — what we call the ""sandwich generation,"" which are people who are raising your young children and taking care of your parents, it's a lot.
And either you have enough money to afford to have somebody come in and help you, which most people don't, or you might have to give up your job, which means you're cutting off a source of income for your household, or you have to spend down your savings to qualify for Medicaid. That's just not right.
So, my plan is to say that we are going to fix it so that Medicare covers the cost of home health care work for seniors — (applause) — because it's about dignity. It's about dignity, so more seniors can live at home with dignity. (Applause.)
Our plan will lower costs on everything from health care to groceries.
I'm going to take on corporate price gouging like I've done before. I'm going to do it again. (Applause.)
My plan will also give middle-class tax cuts to 100 million Americans, including $6,000 during the first year of a child's life, because here is where I'm coming from: The vast majority of our young parents have a natural desire to parent their children well, but not always the resources. And so, looking at expanding the child tax credit — again, it's about dignity. It's about recognizing that folks just need a little help to buy a car seat or a crib or the essential needs for your child during such a critical stage of their development. (Applause.)
And by the way, we all benefit from that. Everybody benefits from that. (Applause.)
So, these are just some examples of our plan.
And all of that to say, look, I will always — I will always stand and fight for the middle class and working families of America. (Applause.) I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. (Applause.)
My plan also invests in American manufacturing and innovation, and I will make sure America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Exactly right. Exactly right.
And Michigan knows — and Michigan knows better than most what that means, about investing in American industry. (Applause.) Under my plan, we will invest in the industries that built America, like steel, iron, and the great American auto industry. (Applause.)
And contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive. (Applause.) But here's what I will do: I will invest in communities like Oakland County and Detroit. (Applause.) We will retool existing factories and hire locally and work with unions to create good-paying jobs — (applause) — including, by the way, jobs that do not require a college degree.
Because this is how I feel — (applause) — look, this is how I feel about that. We all know a college degree is not the only measure of the skills and experience of a qualified worker. (Applause.) So, part of my plan is to do an assessment of all the federal jobs, which will be under our jurisdiction, to figure out which of them should be rethought of in terms of whether or not it actually requires a college degree. And the next step on that is going to be to challenge the private sector to do the same. (Applause.)
I will also protect the pensions of union members and retirees — (applause) — including yesterday, when I announced the protection of the full-earned pension benefits of more than 22,500 retirees under the Detroit Carpenters Pension Fund. Because back to the point about dignity, I understand the dignity of work, and I understand the importance of having dignity in your retirement. (Applause.)
Now, Donald Trump has a different approach.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I don't need to tell you, he's full of big promises, but always fails to deliver. Always fails to deliver. So, remember he said he was the only one — you know how he talks — ""the only one""– (applause) –who could bring back America's manufacturing jobs. Remember when he said that? And then America lost almost 200,000 manufacturing jobs when he was president —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — including tens of thousands of jobs right here in Michigan.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And those losses started before the pandemic — okay? — making Donald Trump one of the biggest losers — (applause) — of manufacturing jobs in American history. (Laughs.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And his — and his track record for the auto industry was also a disaster.
He promised workers in Warren — you remember? He promised workers in Warren that the auto industry would — and I'm going to quote — ""not lose one plant"" during his presidency. Then, American automakers announced the closure of six auto plants when he was president —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — including General Motors in Warren and Stellantis in Detroit. Remember that?
Thousands, thousands of Michigan autoworkers lost their jobs. And Donald Trump's running mate — you know, because the position was vacant and he had to fill it, right? (Laughter.) You know, for the young people here — you know, when you go for an interview, and you sit down at the interview and you ask the person who's interviewing, ""Why's the job vacant?"" (Laughter.)
So, Donald Trump's current running mate recently suggested that if they win, they would threaten the Grand River Assembly plant in Lansing.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: The same plant that our administration protected earlier this year, saving 650 union jobs. (Applause.)
And remember, Donald Trump encouraged automakers to move their plants out of Michigan so they could pay their workers less.
And when the UAW went on strike — (applause) — when the UAW went on strike to demand the higher wages that you deserved, Donald Trump went to a non-union shop. Remember?
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he attacked the UAW. And he said striking — he said striking and collective bargaining don't — and I'mma quote — ""don't make a damn bit of difference."" That's what he said —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — about striking and collective bargaining.
Well, Michigan, you know better. We know better. Strong unions mean higher wages, better health care, and greater dignity — (applause) — for union members and everyone else,
because you don't have to be a member of a union to thank unions for your five-day workweek and your vacation time and your sick leave. Thank a union. (Applause.)
Which is why, when I am president, with your help, I will sign the PRO Act into law — (applause) — and make it easier for workers to join a union and negotiate for better pay and working conditions.
And now Donald Trump is making the same empty promises to the people of Michigan that he did before, hoping you will forget how he let you down the last time.
But we're not falling for the okey doke. No, and we won't be fooled.
Just, for example, google Project 2025 —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — which I still, by the way, find it fascinating to think that they actually put that in writing. (Applause.) I mean, they put it in writing. They published it, they bound it, and gave it out, right?
And here's the thing, to read it is to know it is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president. Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts; cut Social Security and Medicare; get rid of the $35 cap on insulin for seniors that you all helped us get; make it easier — he will — and read it — make it — he will make it easier for companies to deny overtime pay to workers —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and he intends to impose what I call a ""Trump sales tax,"" which is at least 20 percent, if not more, of a tax on everyday basic necessities, which economists have estimated will cost the American family an additional $4,000 a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And if that weren't enough, on top of this and all of this, he plans to end the Affordable Care Act.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he has no plan to replace it.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: He has concepts!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He has — because he has, quote, ""concepts of a plan."" (Laughs.)
So, you all have heard me say, you know, I think — I think Donald Trump is an unserious man. And the consequences if he were to ever get in — back into the White House, are — are absolutely dangerously serious.
Because, think about it, he's going to threaten that health insurance coverage of 45 —
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay, so here's the thing — here's the thing about that — here's the thing about that. The courts are going to take care of that. (Applause.) We're going to take care of November. We're going to take care of November. How about that? Right. We'll take care of November. (Applause.)
But, again, ""concepts of a plan."" So, think about it in terms of the serious nature of this. He's basically threatening the health insurance coverage of 45 million Americans based on a concept.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And taking us back to when — you remember? — insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was? And that's why we are —
AUDIENCE: Not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — not going back.
We are not going back. No, we are not going back. We will move forward. (Applause.) We will move forward. (Applause.)
Because ours is a fight for the future. (Applause.) Ours is a fight for the future. And it is a fight for freedom — (applause) — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body — (applause) — and not have her government tell her what to do.
And we are — we remember how we got here, right? Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended.
And now, check this out, in America, one in three women live in a state with a Trump abortion ban —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — many with no exception even for rape and incest, which — which means you're telling someone who is a survivor of a violation to their body that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next? That is immoral. Immoral.
And let us agree, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body — (applause) — not the government, not the government. No.
If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government and some folks up in a statehouse telling her what's in her own best interest.
And so, here's my pledge to you. When Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly sign it into law.
And across our nation — listen, I'm traveling the country, and I'll tell you, across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on hard-won freedoms and rights, including the freedom to vote.
Let me tell you, I — in places like Georgia, where I'm spending some time, you know, they passed a law that makes it illegal to give people food and water for standing in line to vote.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I mean, the hypocrisy abounds. What happened to ""love thy neighbor""?
Attacks on the freedom to join a union. Attacks on the freedom to be safe from gun violence — Mia talked about that. Attacks on the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.)
So, I say all that to say what you know — which is again, why you are spending your precious time here. There is so much on the line in this election. And this is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher, because, remember, a few months ago, the Supreme Court of the United States basically told the former president that he is effectively immune from doing whatever he does in office.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Just imagine. He who has vowed, if reelected, to be a dictator on day one; he who calls Americans who disagree with him, the ""enemy from within."" You know where that language comes from? And says that he would use the military — the American military to go after the American people.
He who has called for the quote, ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States of America. And —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And let us be very clear, someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States of America should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States of America. (Applause.) Never again. Never again. Never again. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, we are not going back, and so this is how we're going to make sure we don't go back. Okay, so, here — let's get to the business then.
So, Michigan, it all comes down to this. We are here together because we know what is at stake. We are here together, most importantly, also because we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country.
And I do believe it is one of the highest expressions and forms of love of our country and patriotism to then fight for the ideals of our country and to fight — (applause) — and to fight to realize the promise of America.
So, Election Day is in 18 days, okay? And here in Michigan, early voting starts on Saturday, October 26th, one week from tomorrow.
If you live in Wayne County, you can vote in person even sooner. Early voting in Detroit starts tomorrow. (Applause.) Okay?
So, now is the time to make your plan to vote. And if you have received your ballot in the mail, please do not wait. Fill it out tonight and return it. Because, folks, the election is here, and we need to — as you know best how to do — we need to energize, we need to organize, we need to mobilize — (applause) — knowing — knowing our vote is our voice and your voice is your power. (Applause.)
So, Michigan, today, I ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
Because when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we in.
God bless you. And God bless America. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Lansing, Michigan
  


  

  
    October 19, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hey, everybody. Hey. (Applause.) Hey, everyone. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, everyone.
Oh, it's good to be in the house of labor. Good afternoon. (Applause.) Good afternoon.
Ben, I want to thank you for your leadership. I just said to him, I mean, what a leader he is. You know, I just — first of all, it's so good to be in the house of labor, and it's so good to be with people who understand the dignity of work and fight for it every day. And it's not an easy fight, but it's a good fight.
And I thank you for all that you do, Ben, and everybody who is here. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
So, it's wonderful to be back in Michigan and to be with so many incredible leaders, including, of course, Representative Slotkin. Where is she? She's — there you are. (Applause.) Who we must elect to the United States Senate. (Applause.) And we will. I'm counting on that.
State Senator Hertel, let's send him to the United States House of Representatives. (Applause.) There you are.
And a special thanks to the brothers and sisters of United Auto Workers. Thank you for all that you are, all that you do, and the warm welcome. (Applause.)
And, of course, for generations in Lansing and across our country, union members have helped lead the fight for fair pay, better benefits, and safe working conditions, and every person in our nation has benefited from your work.
You know, everywhere I go, I tell people, you may not be a union member, but you better thank unions — (applause) — for the five-day work week, for sick leave, for paid family leave and vacation time, because we are all clear: Collective bargaining benefits our entire nation — our entire nation. (Applause.)
Because here's the deal. When union wages go up, everybody's wages go up. When union workplaces are safer, everyone's workplace is safer. So, thank a union. (Applause.) Thank a union.
And the bottom line is when unions are strong, America is strong. Unions have always fought to make our nation more equal, more fair, and more free. And in this election, everything we have fought for, for years in this movement — in this movement, for unions and for labor, is on the line.
And I'm about to talk about it in real terms because we always have real talk with each other, and your members can afford nothing less, which has been why I appreciate your leadership.
This election is about two very different visions for our nation: one that's trying to take us backward — him — and ours that is about moving forward and about the future. (Applause.) We fight — we fight for a future where we protect the freedom to organize, where we understand the importance of collective bargaining.
You know, I sometimes say to young people — and, by the way, have you noticed how, when you look at the polling, younger workers coming into the workforce, they get it and they understand the power and the nobility of unions.
And I always say to people, look, here's the thing about collective bargaining. Everybody should want that, when there's a negotiation, the outcome would be fair. Right? Who's going to argue with that? Everybody should want that — that there will be a fair outcome in a negotiation.
All right. So, if we start from there — we're all reasonable people — then let's think about it. If you're talking about the worker, the one worker trying to negotiate against the corporation, is that outcome going to be fair?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: No. The disparity in power is too great. So, collective bargaining, it's a simple, simple and important point. You let the workers organize so that the collective, together, who have the same concerns, the same issues, can be banded together to have equal power in a negotiation, because the whole point is the outcome of the negotiation should be fair. That's what collective bargaining is about. That's what unions are about. (Applause.)
It's about basic fairness, and it's about the dignity of work, understanding all workers deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. That's what we're talking about when we talk about this movement and the strength of the movement and the importance of keeping it going.
We talk about, then, our knowledge about the importance of building a future where we tap into the ambition of the American people, where we build what I call an ""opportunity economy"" — right? — so every American has an opportunity to own a home, to buy a car, to build wealth, to start a business.
And I will always — it is my pledge to you — put the middle class and working people first. I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. (Applause.) I will never forget where I come from. I know where I come from.
Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work and must receive the value to which it is due, which means understanding the value of the worker. (Applause.)
And we know we cannot have a strong middle class without American manufacturing. Over the last three and a half years, we brought manufacturing back to America, creating 730,000 manufacturing jobs — (applause) — with your help — with your help. We announced the opening of more than 20 new auto plants in the United States, and we did it by investing in American industry and American workers. (Applause.)
And I will make sure America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century. (Applause.)
So, under my plan, it's about investing in the industries that built America, like steel, iron, the great American auto industry. And we will ensure that the next generation of breakthroughs, from advanced batteries to electric vehicles, are not just invented but built right here in America by American union workers. (Applause.) Because it is they and you who have proven how to get the job done. (Applause.)
And as part of that vision, we will invest in manufacturing communities like Lansing. We will retool existing factories, hire locally, and work with unions to create good-paying jobs, including, by the way, jobs that do not require a college degree.
And I'mma tell you why. And I'mma tell you why, because I'm really clear that a college degree is not the only measure of the skills and experience of the qualified worker, and we need to understand — (applause) — we need to understand that.
In fact, it is my pledge that, as president, I'm going to do a critical assessment of federal jobs to look at those that don't require a college degree so we can start talking about good jobs based on the skill and experience of the worker and not random measures of who can do what. And I plan on, then, challenging the private sector to do the same. (Applause.)
And we will importantly protect the pensions of union workers and retirees. (Applause.) Again, it's about the dignity of work, which includes the dignity of retirement. After a lifetime of working hard, let's talk about the dignity of retirement, the dignity of aging.
And that's why, as attorney general, I sued the big banks to return hundreds of millions of dollars to workers and their families after their pensions were mismanaged. This is not new to me. I've done that work.
As a United States senator, I pushed for legislation to rescue workers' pensions without cutting the benefits that workers had earned.
And, as vice president, I worked alongside then-Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh, and we, for a year, worked on what we needed to do with the federal workforce, which was in our direct power, to increase the ability for collective bargaining and to ensure that they have all the resources they need to grow in terms of organizing.
As vice president, I also helped to do the long overdue work to protect the pensions of more than 1 million union members. And yesterday, I announced the protection of the full earned pension benefits of more than 22,500 union workers and retirees in Michigan under the Detroit Carpenters' Pension Fund. (Applause.)
Because, again, just to put a fine point on it, when it comes to your pension or Social Security or Medicare, these are retirement benefits you have earned. This is not about a giveaway. You've earned it. And it must be protected, and it must be respected — after decades of hard work, that you receive it. And honoring these benefits must be an ironclad commitment. (Applause.)
Now — now let's talk about, you know, the guy on the other side. Let's talk about Donald Trump for a minute. Shall we? So —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And because he has a very different view. Now, in all seriousness, he has a very different view of workers, of hard work, of the dignity of work. You guys — we know it. We know it.
He tries to, you know, do his rhetorical thing at — at rallies like he understands what it means to earn a living. No, you understand what I'm saying. He pretends that he understands workers and the hard work and the battle workers face every day to get their due wages and benefits.
Well, we're not falling for the okey-doke, because we know — we know what he has said, and we know what he has done. (Applause.) He who called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. He called it a Ponzi scheme. He recommended we raise the retirement age to 70. Can you imagine, if you are required to work to 70? He who intends to cut Social Security and Medicare?
You know, we know how many people — their only source of income is their social security check. Talk about — right? — is the value about dignity in retirement, dignity in aging. And remember, he was the only one — he said he was going to be the only one who could bring back America's manufacturing jobs. You know how he talks. (Deepens voice.) ""I'm the only one,"" right? (Laughter.) You know how he talks. (Laughter and applause.)
And then, because we're too busy watching what he's doing to hear what he's saying, we know America lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs when he was president — okay? — including tens of thousands of jobs right here in Michigan. And those losses, we know and we'll note, started before the pandemic — okay? — making Donald Trump one of the biggest —
AUDIENCE: Losers!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — losers of manufacturing jobs in American history.
And his track record for the auto industry was a disaster. He promised workers in Warren that the auto industry would — I'm going to quote — ""not lose one plant"" under his presidency. Then American automakers announced the closure of six auto plants when he was president, including General Motors in Warren and Stellantis in Detroit. Thousands of Michigan autoworkers lost their jobs.
And if he wins again, we can expect there would be more of the same, because we know what he has done. And we know that we're going to focus on the work, not the words, when it comes to Donald Trump, and we know where he took us the last time.
And check this out. Donald Trump's current running mate — because you know the job was open, right? (Laughter.) You know, like, when people go for an interview — especially the young people, they'll go for an interview, and they'll sit down and they're in the interview, and they'll say, ""Why is the job open?"" (Laughter.) Well, we know why that job was open. (Laughter.)
So, Donald Trump's running mate recently suggested that if they win, they would threaten the Grand River Assembly plant right here in Lansing —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — the same plant that, with your help, our administration protected earlier this year, saving 650 union jobs. (Applause.) Right?
And I do believe some of the union workers from Grand River are here with us today. So, you know what I'm ta- — (applause) — so, you know I'm talking about. You know what I'm talking about. And Trump's running mate called your jobs ""table scraps,"" right?
So, let me just say — needless to say — I will always have your back — (applause) — and will keep fighting to make sure that you keep your jobs right here in Lansing and keep these most noble and important jobs for America's strength. That's the work you all do.
You know, Donald Trump, he also promised that he was going to stop offshoring. Remember that? Then he cut taxes for corporations that shipped 200,000 jobs overseas during his presidency — cut the taxes for those corporations — okay? — and awarded nearly half a trillion dollars in federal contracts to companies that were offshoring jobs. Okay? Follow the money.
He gave your tax dollars to companies that were sending your jobs overseas. And we got to get the word out to all of the brothers and sisters in labor to remind them of what this dude does — right? — what he actually does. (Applause.)
Because, make no mistake, Donald Trump is no friend to labor.
AUDIENCE: No!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He is no friend to labor, and we've got to listen to what he says. Know that — you know that famous saying: Listen when people tell you who they are.
In fact, can we roll the clip? (Laughter.) Let's see. There we —
(A video clip is played.)
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right? Right. Right.
So, of course, that last bit, he was talking about Shawn Fain, who — who represents nearly a million active and retired autoworkers. Okay? So, that's about a million autoworkers, active and retired.
Donald Trump — listen to his words: He's saying that autoworkers are essentially engaged in child's play, that children could do it. Listen to what he says.
I'm telling you, he — you know, he's got his club, and I'm going to tell you, union workers are not part of his club. Let's be clear about that. No matter what he does at his rallies, let's be clear about that, right?
He thinks that the value of your work is essentially meaningless. That's what he's saying, to compare it to child's work?
When we here know the work you do is complex. You do it with great care. You work hard. You are highly skilled. You are highly trained. And the best autoworkers in the world is who you are — the best in the world — (applause) — the best in the world.
And the fact is, Donald Trump's comments are the talk of someone who has had everything handed to him.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: That's exactly right.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I know it's right. (Laughter.) It is — I know. It is.
This man, you know, who never had to work a job that came with calloused hands or an hourly wage — right? — someone who got handed $400 million on a silver platter and did what with it? Filed bankruptcy six times. (Applause.) Come on. Come on.
He will never understand the life of a United Auto Worker — he will never understand that — people who work hard for everything they have, who take great pride in a job well done, who understand what it represents to their family and the future of their family. Again, I go back to the dignity of hard work.
So, let us be clear. Donald Trump's insults to American workers is not exclusive to that video. Okay? So, that was just a moment. Kind of think of it as the commercial break in my speech. (Laughter.)
But his comments are not only that, because Donald Trump has been a union buster his entire career. He has called union leaders, quote, ""Dues Sucking"" people. Okay? He said that he supports so-called right-to-work laws, quote, ""100 percent."" Okay? He bragged and joked with a billionaire buddy about mass firing striking workers and lowered labor standards and made it easier for companies that break the laws to get federal contracts.
Donald Trump encouraged automakers of Michigan so they could pay their workers less — encouraged them to move so they could pay their workers less. Okay? And when the UAW went on strike to demand the higher wages you deserve, Donald Trump went to a nonunion shop and attacked the UAW. He said striking and collective bargaining don't make, and I'm going to quote, ""a damn bit of difference.""
So, here's the bottom line, Donald Trump's track record is a disaster for working people. And he is, I believe, an existential threat to America's labor movement. And everything he intends to do, if he is reelected, is also spelled out in that Project 2025.
So, to read it and to know it is to know he intends to launch a full-on attack on unions and the freedom to organize. Okay? He will ban public-sector unions, roll back workplace safety protections. Read it when you have some time. Google it, everybody who's watching. Look, mak- — he will make it easier for companies to deny overtime pay for workers and appoint a union buster to run the Department of Labor. Be sure of that. Be sure of that.
So, to all the friends here, I say what you already know. It's time to turn the page. (Applause.) Let's just turn the page. (Applause.) Turn the page. (Laughs.) Because America is ready to chart a new way forward, and we are not —
AUDIENCE: Going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — going back. We are not going back. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: No, we are not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back because, as UAW always does, we are going to push forward. We are going to push forward.
And it all comes down to this. Look, you all have taken time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon, and we are all here together because we know the stakes in this election are so high.
We are all here together because we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism, the expression of the love of our country, to fight for our ideals. And that's what this is about.
This is not, at the end of the day, a fight against something; this is a fight for something. (Applause.) This is a fight for something, including the fight to realize the promise of America. After all, that's what unions have always done. It's about understanding the promise of America, which has to include the promise that we should make to the workers of America.
So, we have 18 days to get this done. It's not a lot of time. Okay? And we know this is going to be a tight race until the very end. We are the underdog. But make no mistake, we will win. (Applause.) We will win. We will win. We will win, I'm telling you.
It's going to be hard work, but we like hard work. Hard work is good work. (Applause.)
And ultimately, we will win because we know what we stand for. (Applause.) And when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. (Applause.) Right?We stand for opportunity. We stand for dignity. And we stand for the future. (Applause.)
And so, I'll close by saying, and when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. God bless America. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Atlanta, Georgia
  


  

  
    October 19, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Ohh. Good evening, Georgia! (Applause.) Good evening.
Can we give it up for Tyler? (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hey, everybody.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Oh, thank you.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)
All right. We got some work to do. All right. Thank you. It is so good to be back in Atlanta. Thank you all. (Applause.)
Oh, my goodness. It is so good to be back. And I want to thank all of the incredible leaders who are here. I want to thank everyone for being here when there are so many things that you have to do with your time, and to taking the time to be here and for us to be here as community, building coalition, being together means the world.
This is what our campaign is about. Our campaign is about the people. (Applause.) Our campaign is about the people.
And I want to thank Senator Ossoff, who is here — (applause); Atlanta's own, Representative Nikema Williams — (applause). And the many members of the Congressional Black Caucus who are here today, I thank you. (Applause.) Mayor Dickens, thank you. Every time I come, you meet me on the tarmac. (Applause.) My pastor, who is here, Reverend Dr. Amos C. Brown, of Third Baptist Church in San Francisco, I thank you. (Applause.) And, of course, Ursher — (laughs) — Usher. (Laughter and applause.) I got you. (Laughs.)
And so, I thank you all, everybody, for taking the time to be here together. And before —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you all.
Okay. So, before I continue, let me just say, on a serious note, there are people here in Georgia still dealing with the devastation from Hurricane Helene, and I am grateful to all the federal, state, and local personnel who have been working around the clock to help those who are impacted. (Applause.)
As we know, this recovery will take time, and we will stand with Georgia and everyone across the Southeast who are impacted by these recent storms for as long as it takes to rebuild. (Applause.) Thank you.
All right. So, Atlanta, we have 17 days left — (applause) — 17 days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. And, look, let's have some real talk. It's going to be a tight race until the very end. (Applause.) And we are the underdog, and we are running as the underdog. But make no mistake, we will win. (Applause.)
We will win. Yes, we will. We will win. Yes, we will.
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Addressing an audience member.) You got the old school!
And we will win — and we will win because we understand what is at stake. This election is about two very different visions for our nation: one, Donald Trump's, who is focused on the past —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and ours that is focused on the future. (Applause.) Ours that is focused on bringing down the cost of living, investing in small businesses and entrepreneurs.
By the way, I love our small businesses. Can I see the small business leaders and entrepreneurs who are here? (Applause.)
I'm telling you, our small businesses are the backbone of America's economy. I thank you all.
And we are here because we are committed to protecting reproductive freedom. (Applause.)
But none of that is what we hear from Donald Trump. Instead, it is just the same old, tired playbook over and over again. (Applause.) He has no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people. He is only focused on himself. And now he's ducking debates —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and canceling interviews because of exhaustion.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And when he does answer a question or speak at a rally, have you noticed he tends to go off script and ramble? (Applause.) And generally, for the life of him, cannot finish a thought. (Laughter.) And he has called it the ""weave."" (Laughter.) But I think we here would call it nonsense. (Laughter and applause.)
So, folks, for these reasons and more, it is time to turn the page. (Applause.) It's time to turn the page. And America is ready to chart a new way forward. (Applause.) We are ready. We are ready for a new and optimistic generation of leadership. (Applause.) All of you. All of you. All of you. Which is why Democrats, Republicans, and independents are supporting our campaign. (Applause.)
In fact, earlier this week, over 100 Republican leaders from across the country joined me on the campaign trail — (applause) — including some who worked in Donald Trump's administration. And I believe, as I travel our country, Americans really want a president who works for all the American people — (applause) — all the American people — who understands that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. Right?
Folks are exhausted with someone trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other. It's ex- — we're exhausted with it. That's why I say it's time to turn the page on that. Let's turn the page — (applause) — and have a president who cares about all the people.
And you all know I've only ever, in my career, had one client: the people. (Applause.) The people.
As a young courtroom prosecutor, I stood up for women and children. As attorney general of California, I fought for students and veterans. As vice president, I have stood up for workers and seniors. (Applause.) And as president, I will fight for all the American people. (Applause.) And together, we will build a brighter future for our nation.
Together, we will build a brighter future that includes what I call an opportunity economy — (applause) — so that every American has the opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business.
And to build that opportunity economy, we've got to bring down the cost of living — (applause) — because while inflation is down and wages are up, prices are still h- — too high. You know it, and I know it.
And so, I have laid out a comprehensive plan to lower the costs that you pay on everything from prescription medication to groceries, and this will be my focus every single day as president of the United States. (Applause.)
I will take on corporate price gouging. I've done it before, and I'll do it again. (Applause.)
I will give a middle-class tax cut to 100 million Americans, including $6,000 during the first year of a child's life. And I'm going to tell you why: Because we all know young parents have a natural desire to parent their children well but not always the resources to do it. And we, as a community, need to understand they are the children of the community, and it is in our collective best interest to make sure that they have the resources they need during that critical phase of a child's development to buy a crib, to buy a car seat, to buy what that child needs during that critical stage of life.
That's the kind of leadership that we believe in in America. (Applause.)
I have a pr- — a plan to bring down the cost of housing by building more homes and taking on those corporate landlords who are unfairly buying up properties and increasing rental prices. (Applause.) We know what's happening.
My plan will lower the cost of starting a small business, including by increasing the tax deduction for entrepreneurs from $5,000 to $50,000 — (applause) — knowing that our small-business owners are civic leaders as much as they are business leaders. They mentor. They hire locally. They are part of the cultural fabric of our communities and deserve to be lifted up in every way.
Under my opportunity economy, I have a plan to lower health costs and health care costs for people as they age so they can grow old with dignity and so their families are not financially crushed by the cost of home care. (Applause.)
Because, look, let me tell you — you all may know this; it's a personal story — I helped take care of my mother when she was sick. I took care of my mother when she was sick. And for any of you who is taking care of an elder relative, you know that's about love and it's about care. It's about trying to cook something for them that they feel like eating. It's about trying to help them put on clothes that won't irritate their skin, help them put on a sweater. It's about, from time to time, trying to think of something that will put a smile on their face or make them laugh. It's about dignity. It's about dignity.
But what we know is that right now we have so many people who are doing that and raising small children at the same time. We call it the sandwich generation. And unless you got a lot of money to be able to hire somebody to help, then folks are looking at the potential of having to leave their job, which is losing a source of income or — worse even — having to spend down whatever might be their savings to be able to qualify for Medicaid. That's not right. That's not right. (Applause.)
So, my plan includes allowing Medicare to cover the cost of home health care for our seniors. (Applause.) It's a matter of dignity — dignity.
And so, I share some of these details with you to just let you know what you already know: I will always put the middle class and working families first. (Applause.) I always will.
I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. (Applause.) I will never forget where I come from.
Now, Donald Trump —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You know here I go. Now, Donald Trump, well, he has a different plan. Just google Project 2025.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Now, I say it every time, but I just have to say again. Can you believe they put that thing in writing? (Laughter.) They put it in writing. They published it. They bound it and handed it out.
And when you read it, you know it is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what Donald Trump will do if he is elected president.
Donald Trump — Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts. Like he did it last time, he would do it again.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He would cut Social Security and Medicare. He would get rid of the thing we all fought so hard for: that $35-a-month cap on insulin for our seniors. (Applause.)
Read that plan and you'll see they'll make it easier for companies to deny overtime pay for workers.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And impose — he will impose what I call a Trump sales tax, because he has an intention of putting an at least 20 percent tax on everyday necessities, which economists have estimated would cost the average person more than $4,000 more a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on top of all of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — with no plan to replace it.
Oh, y'all watched the debate. (Laughs.) He has, quote —
AUDIENCE: Concepts of a plan.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — ""concepts of a plan.""
So, you all know and you've heard me say, look, I think and I do believe Donald Trump is an unserious man, and the consequences of him ever being again in the White House are brutally serious — brutally serious. Because, think about it, the man is going to threaten the health insurance of 45 million Americans based on a concept and take us back to when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was?
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, we are —
AUDIENCE: Not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — not going back. (Applause.) We are not going back. We are not going back.
We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we are not going back because we are working and intend to move forward.
AUDIENCE: Forward!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Forward, because ours is a fight for the future. (Applause.)
And it is a fight for freedom — (applause) — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. (Applause.)
And we know how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended. And now, in America, more than one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban.
Today, except for Virginia, every state in the South, including Georgia, has a Trump ban, many with no exceptions even for rape or incest, which is telling a survivor of a violation to their body they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. That's immoral. That's immoral.
And let us agree: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do — (applause) — not the government. If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government telling her what to do.
So, look, we all know this is a health care crisis. This is not something theoretical. This is not just about a political conversation. It's very real, and Donald Trump is the architect.
Women are being denied care during miscarriages, some only being treated once they develop sepsis, and tragically, because of these bans, some women have even died.
Let me show you what I'm talking about. Roll the clip.
(A video clip is played.) (Applause.)
So, I — here's the thing that — that you got to understand, and I think everyone is following this. Donald Trump still refuses to take accountability — to take any accountability for the pain and the suffering he has caused, or even to just acknowledge the pain and suffering that has actually happened.
In a Fox town hall earlier this week, he even mocked Amber's family for sharing their story.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Play the clip.
(A video clip is played.)
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You know, we — we talk and we care about things like dignity. We understand that the real —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, I hear you. But, you know, the thing i- — you know what? The court is going to take care of that. We're going to take care of November. (Applause.) Right? We're going to take care of November. We're going to take care of November.
But — but here's the thing. Here's the thing. Here's the thing. A grieving family — a grieving family sharing the memory of their daughter with our nation — where is the compassion?
You know, part of what's wrong with what's been happening in this so-called Trump era is that there's this backward notion that somehow the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down, instead of what we know, which is that the real measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. (Applause.) It's based on who you lift up.
And what we see continually from Donald Trump is exactly what that clip shows. He belittles their sorrow, making it about himself and his television ratings. It is cruel.
And, listen, I promised Amber's mother that we will always remember her story and speak her name: Amber Nicole Thurman.
AUDIENCE: Amber Nicole Thurman. Amber Nicole Thurman.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Amber Nicole Thurman. And Amber's family, including her parents, Shanette and Andre, are here with us tonight. (Applause.) And in front of all the friends here, I thank them both for their courage and their strength, and it is my pledge to the family — (applause) — there she is. There she is. And I have pledged to the family — it is my pledge to everybody here: When Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) I will proudly sign it into law.
So, there's so much at stake. And, you know, I'm traveling the country, and everybody here knows, across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard-won fundamental freedoms and rights — like right here in Georgia, the freedom to vote — (applause); the freedom we are seeing in so many places in our country, an attack on the freedom to be safe from gun violence; the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.)
So, so much is on the line in this election. And this election is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher for obvious reasons, including because just a few months ago, the United States Supreme Court basically told the former president he is effectively immune no matter what he does in the White House.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But — and just think about this — right? — so, before that ruling just a few months ago, at least there was some possibility of threat of consequence for misbehavior — right? — for breaking the law. But just imagine now Donald Trump with no guardrails — he who has vowed that he will be a dictator on day one; he who calls Americans who disagree with him the ""enemy from within.""
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Understand where that comes from in history. And says he would use the American military to go after American citizens.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He — he who has called for the ""termination,"" I quote, of the Constitution of the United States of America.
And let us be very clear: Someone who suggests that we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States of America. (Applause.) Never again. Never again. Never again.
So, Georgia, it comes down to this. We are all here together because we know what is at stake. We are all here together because we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to then fight for the ideals of our country. That's what this is about. This is about a fight for the promise of America. (Applause.) Right? Right.
And the extraordinary, great Congressman John Lewis reminded us that democracy is not a state; it is an act. It is an act.
So, Georgia, now is our time to act. The baton is in our hands. Election Day is in 17 days, and early voting has already started. (Applause.)
You guys are setting some records, by the way. And so, now is the time to make your plan to vote. Make your plan. Go to IWillVote.com and get all the information you need. And if you have received your ballot in the mail, please do not wait. Fill it out and return it right away.
And you know, Georgia's own president, Jimmy Carter, voted early. (Applause.) Bless him. Just days after his 100th birthday.
So, look, if Jimmy Carter can vote early, you can too. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
Because, folks, the election is here. It's here. And I need you to continue to do what you do so well. Let's continue to energize. Let's continue to organize. Let's continue to mobilize. And let's remind folks that your vote is your voice and your voice is your power.
And so, Georgia, I ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win. (Applause.)
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.

    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Are we going to do this? (Applause.) Yes!
Hey, Detroit. Macsen, thank you so much.
Hey, Detroit. (Applause.) Are we ready to get out there and get everyone to vote? (Inaudible.) And the mic is not on. Now it's on. (Applause.)
Hey, Detroit, are we ready? (Applause.) Yes, we are. So, before I came out, my team was telling me, and I was talking to some members of the press, and they said, ""Hey, since early voting has started"" —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Can you hear me?
AUDIENCE: Yes.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You can hear me. They can't hear me.
Okay. I'm going to — I did- — I didn't want to have to stand right here. Okay. Can you hear me now? Okay. (Applause.) There we go.
So, my team was telling me — so, you know, Georgia started early voting, and they broke historic records in early voting. North Carolina started early voting, broke historic records in North Carolina. (Applause.)
Now, who is the capital of producing records? (Applause.) So, we are going to break some records here in Detroit today. (Applause.) Yes, we are.
We are going to do this because we know what is at stake, and we know the power of the people. (Applause.) This is about the power of the people. This is about knowing each one of us as an individual and as a collective, as a community, as a coalition, we have the power to make the decisions about the direction of our country, and we know this election is about two very different visions for our future. Ours, focused on the future, focused on our young leaders, focused on possibility, understanding the ambitions and the aspirations and the dreams of the American people — (applause) — understanding, like the people of Detroit, we have grit, we have excellence, we have history. (Applause.)
And it's about looking in the face of a perfect stranger and seeing a neighbor and understanding we are all in this together. We all have so much more in common than what separates us, and we are going to fight for this country we love. We are in this to win it. (Applause.)
And we know, look, the race is tight. It's going to be hard work, but we like hard work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work. And we will win. (Applause.) And we will win.
So, you all are here taking time out of your busy lives and all your other obligations, and I thank you so very much. And I know — and — and I know what today is. We're here because this is a working day. We're ready to get out there. We're ready to walk the neighborhood. We are ready to talk with our neighbors and our friends and just the people that we see and remind them they are important and that we are so optimistic about our new generation of leadership for America and what we will do together that is about investing in working people, in middle-class people, in our children; what we do in terms of caring about the education of our children, which is why we're not falling for the other guy trying to get rid of the Department of Education and Head Start — (applause) — because we know what we stand for. We stand for the idea that the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down, it's on who you lift up. (Applause.)
And these are the things that we stand for as a community of people that understand the importance of caring and kindness, who understand the importance of having a leader who speaks truth and is not so self-consumed.
You know, I keep talking about somebody needs to just watch his rallies if you're not really sure how to vote — (laughter) — because he spends full time talking about himselves and mythical characters, not talking about the working people, not talking about you, not talking about lifting you up.
And so, as we spend these next 17 days, we're going to go vote today; we're going to remind people to vote; we're going to register folks to vote; we're going to email, text, phone call, knock on doors — (applause); and we're going to remind people of what is at stake.
And with that, I want to thank incredible leaders from Michigan who are here: the lieutenant governor, Garlin Gilchrist. (Applause.) He always stands above the crowd. (Laughs.) We have Representative Slotkin, who is here, who we will send to the Senate in November. (Applause.) Representative Thanedar, who is here; Wayne County Executive Evans; Mayor Duggan; and all of the national labor union presidents who are here. (Applause.) And let's not forget the most phenomenal Lizzo. (Applause.)
So, to everyone who is here, I'm not going to spend any more time on the stage, because we got work to do. We have 17 days to get this done, and we're not going to be able — we're never going to — we're not going to be able to get these 17 days back.
And what I think we all know is on Election Day, we don't want to have any regrets about what we could have done these next 17 days. And on November 5th, and at the end of that day, we're going to look at each other, and we're going to say, ""Yes, the power was with the people, and we made a difference.""
And that's the beauty of who we are as a nation. We know we can make a difference because the power is with the people. (Applause.)
God bless you. Thank you. I'll see you out there. Thank you all. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at an Early Vote Event in Jonesboro, Georgia
  


  

  
    October 20, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, church. (Applause.) Good afternoon. Good afternoon.
Please have a seat. Please have a seat. I will be brief, but please have a seat.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are not going back. No, we are not going back.
Bishop Battle, I want to thank you for warmly receiving me and so many of us who — who joined you this afternoon — to thank you and the congregation and first lady for all the work that you are doing and for getting folks out to the polls today.
I was — I've been in Georgia. Today, I was — earlier, we were in fellowship and prayer with my pastor, who — who flew out from — from San Francisco, Reverend Dr. Amos C. Brown of Third Baptist Church in San Francisco. We were all together this morning.
And I have to say that I do know that we have all been raised in the church to understand ""faith"" is a verb. (Laughs.) It is about what we know and can believe, despite what we see, but it also is something that is going to manifest itself in our actions, our deeds, and our service.
And I know everyone here today and this afternoon is committed to doing just that, and this is an afternoon that is about faith in action.
And, Pastor, I have to say, there is so much at stake right now. And when we think about how we have learned and have understood and lived the knowledge that ours is a loving God, and that we understand that for us to do good works, it means to do it in the spirit of understanding that our strength is not based on who we beat down, as some would try and suggest. Our strength is based on who we lift up.
And that spirit is very much at stake in these next 16 days, which is: Are we a country that honors, through our faith and our deeds, the importance of kindness; of — of support; of understanding the dignity in each other, the respect that we should have for each other?
You know, we know, in terms of the parable of the Good Samaritan, that we have learned and should live a life where in the face of a stranger, we see a neighbor. But that's not what we see on the other side of this oqua- — equation in this election. It is constantly about berating people and belittling people and name-calling.
And I think we of faith, we who believe in our country and love our country, know that we each as individuals and as a community have the power to make decisions through these next 16 days that will be about a statement about what kind of country do we want to live in and is ours a country where the people will speak their word — the power of the people will make the statement that ours is a country that, fueled by our faith, is about doing things that are focused on what's in the best interest of our children, our families; giving people the resources they need around assistance; helping people pull out of poverty — those who want to work hard, who are working hard, but deserve to be seen and uplifted. And these are the issues in this election.
I offer as an example — one of the things that I am very focused on is what we need to do to take care of our elders, right? (Applause.)
So, as a point of personal experience, I will share with you. When my mother was sick — she passed away from cancer. And I know this is ""Pink Sunday"" for many of us. We're — we're acknowledging what we knew t- — need to do to fight breast cancer.
So, my mother, she — she actually did research in breast cancer, okay? And she was one of the very few who actually — a woman of color who was doing this work.
But when my mother was sick, I took care of her. And for anyone who has taken care of an elder in your family — a parent, a grandparent — you know what that is. It's about trying to cook something that they'll feel like eating. It's about trying to give them the clothes that won't irritate their skin, to — to help them to put on a sweater. It's about trying to figure out something you can say that brings a smile to their face or gives them a reason to laugh. It's about dignity. It's about dignity.
So, part of how I think about what we need to do in the future of our country is really have policies that are about sharing and giving and recognizing dignity, which is why part of my plan is that instead of having you have to either leave your job to take care of an elder in your family or try to pull together the money to afford to bring somebody in or — worse yet — have to reduce all of your savings to qualify for Medicaid — I know what I'm talking about. (Applause.)
So, understanding it's about dignity, part of my plan is that we are going to have Medicare co- — cover the cost of in-home health care for our seniors. (Applause.)
And I could go on and on on the list of things that are about — from my perspective, and a lot of it my lived experience — about what kinds of policies a president of the United States should be leading and pushing that are rooted in recognizing the dignity in each one of us and the importance of lifting others up, especially those in need. And as much as anything else, that's what's at stake in this election.
And so, I thank you for all you are willing to do to continue to be leaders in this community, to get folks out to vote. We have to remou- — we have to remind people the power they have, in spite of those that would try to diminish and make people feel powerless, in spite of those who would try and suggest that, ""Oh, if you vote, nothing will happen."" For sure, if you don't vote, nothing will happen. (Applause.)
I mean, recently, I was reminded: Jimmy Carter voted on his 100th birthday. (Applause.) Seems to me everybody can vote. (Laughs.)
But this work is so important because, in these next 16 days, with your help, I hope that we will continue to work on building back up community. The church knows best how to do that. Let's build back up community.
Let's remind each other and perfect strangers we are all in this together. We have so much more in common than what separates us.
So, let's reclaim that spirit for our country as we fight for the future, because we are not going back. We are not going back. (Applause.)
And my final point is to thank the great Stevie Wonder, because my — (applause) — you know, if one were to ever have a life dream — you know, people talk about a bucket list. I think I have just checked off a whole big one — (laughter) — to have Stevie Wonder himself sing me ""Happy Birthday."" (Applause.) (Laughs.) So, I am truly blessed.
MR. WONDER: Madam Vice President, I just want to — want to — if they can just say —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Oh.
MR. WONDER: (Singing.) People, keep on voting.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Keep on voting! People — I'm not going to sing in here. (Laughs.)
AUDIENCE: (Singing.) People, keep on voting.
MR. WONDER: (Singing.) 'Til we reach the higher ground.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: 'Til we reach the higher ground. (Laughs.)
MR. WONDER: Yes!
BISHOP BATTLE: Amen.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: All right. Bishop, I'm going to give you back the mic. (Laughs.) (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President and Liz Cheney at a Campaign Event in Royal Oak, Michigan
  


  

  
    October 21, 2024  

  
    MS. SHRIVER: Okay. Here we go. Sit back. We've got 40 — 40 minutes, and we're going to move quick. Okay?
So, I want this to be like a kitchen table. Like, just think that we're sitting around the kitchen table and we're jamming about all kinds of stuff. That's the feeling I want to have at this —
MS. CHENEY: This is like a Kennedy family kitchen table.
MS. SHRIVER: It — yeah. (Laughter.)
MS. CHENEY: Most people don't have this many, you know?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's good. That's good.
MS. SHRIVER: That's right. It's raucous. It's — it's hot, but it's fun. That's what it's going to be like.
So, this is — I was saying before both of you walked out, this is historic — so I hope everybody takes this in for a minute — to have a leader of the Republican Party and the vice president of the United States. (Applause.)
So, let me begin with you, Madam Vice President. Did you ever think in your wildest dreams that you would be running for president alongside Liz Cheney, who would be advocating for you, campaigning for you — a member of a opposing party putting herself on the line for you?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, let me just start by thanking everyone. Thank you all for taking time out of your busy lives to be here and have this conversation.
And I think we are all here together because we have many things in common. First and foremost, we love our country. We love our country. (Applause.)
You know, so, Maria, perhaps not, but — (laughter).
MS. SHRIVER: Perhaps.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Perhaps not.
But let me say this. So, you mentioned, you know, my background. So, I started my career as a prosecutor, and most of my career has been spent outside of Washington, D.C., not in Washington, D.C. And for most of my career, let me just tell you, I never once asked a victim of crime, a witness, ""Are you a Democrat, or are you a Republican?"" Never. It never would have even occurred to me to ask that. What I did ask everyone: ""Are you okay?""
And when I think, then, about what is at stake in this election, I think that's the biggest question. And it is a moment where, born out of our love of our country, born out of, for me, having taken the oath of office to the Constitution of the United ta- — States at least six times, I believe what is at stake in this election is so fundamental for us as Americans. And it is about: Do we take seriously the importance of a president who obeys the oath to be loyal to the Constitution of the United States? Do we prioritize a president of the United States who cares about rule of law, much less the spirit with which they approach this most powerful position?
There's so much about this last era — when I talk about ""turn the page,"" that's what I'm referring to, like the last decade — that has been about some powerful forces suggesting that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what I think most of us believe, regardless of your party affiliation, that the real measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.
And — (applause) — and so, for that reason, I'm not surprised that Liz Cheney and I are on the same stage 15 days before the election. (Applause.) You know?
MS. SHRIVER: Okay. Well, maybe you're not surprised, but I'm surprised.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.)
MS. SHRIVER: And I think a lot of people are surprised. So, I want to know: Are you surprised? Are you surprised that you're out here campaigning for a Democrat, campaigning for Kamala Harris, against the party that you've been a part of your entire life?
MS. CHENEY: You know, what I would say, first of all, is we all know — everyone who watched January 6th knows, you know, what Donald Trump is willing to do. He lost the election, he tried to overturn it and seize power, and then he sat in his dining room and he watched the attack on television. He watched it. People pleaded with him to tell the mob to leave, and he wouldn't. And he watched law enforcement officers be brutally beaten. He watched it.
That's a depravity that, to me and — and, you know, I think to anyone who's taken the oath of office, makes someone absolutely unfit ever to be president again.
Now — (applause) — I — I could have just said, you know, I'm going to do everything I can to work against Donald Trump, and there are a lot of Republicans who have said that.
MS. SHRIVER: Yes.
MS. CHENEY: I have decided — and I am very proud and I'm honored to have made the decision — to endorse Vice President Harris. (Applause.)
And — and I have gotten to spend time with Vice President Harris. I have had the chance to talk with her about how important it is that we have two strong parties in our country, about the kind of president that I know she'll be.
And I think all of us — it doesn't matter what party you're in — we all know this is a good and an honorable and a great nation, and we have to have leaders — you might say, ""I'm not going to agree on every issue"" — but we have to have leaders who take that seriously. We have to have leaders who are going to be sincere.
And — and as a mother, I want my children to know that there is someone sitting in the Oval Office that they can look up to, someone who can be a role model. And I'm incredibly proud and I know that Vice President Harris will be that. (Applause.)
MS. SHRIVER: Right.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And — and, Maria, let me just add one thing also, because it bears repeating. I have seen a lot of Republicans go up to Liz Cheney and thank her. And they may not be doing it publicly — they may not be doing it publicly, because I think she has shown, to your point, extraordinary courage, especially in this environment, post January 6th, where there's something — an undercurrent that is violent in terms of the language and the tenor.
And for her to show the courage she has shown is extraordinary. But she's — I've seen Republicans come up to her and — and I — from my vantage point, she's actually not alone. (Applause.)
MS. SHRIVER: And so, I want to talk about that, because there are a lot of people who are scared. Scared to vote —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MS. SHRIVER: — for you. Scared about the environment. Scared to talk about politics.
How scary was it for you, personally, to make this decision? What has been the personal cost for you to do so?
MS. CHENEY: It — it was not — it wasn't scary at all, in terms of making this decision, because when I look at the — the nature of the threat that Donald Trump poses and — and, look, Donald Trump is doing everything he can to try to get people to forget about what he did — what he did on January 6th.
And — and when you think about that level of instability, the level of erratic decision-making, the misogyny, that's not someone that you can entrust with the power of the Oval Office.
And so, I — I think that we are facing a — a choice in this election. It's not about party; it's about right and wrong.
And — and I certainly have many Republicans who will say to me, ""I can't be public."" They do worry about a whole range of things —
MS. SHRIVER: Right.
MS. CHENEY: — including violence. But — but they'll do the right thing.
And I would just remind people: If you're at all concerned, you can vote your conscience and not ever have to say a word to anybody. (Applause.) And there will be millions of Republicans who do that on November 5th — vote for Vice President Harris.
MS. SHRIVER: Yes.
I — I love that you said you weren't scared at all, because most people will talk today about ""I'm afraid to say anything on social media."" ""I'm afraid to speak in my place of worship."" ""I'm aprai- — afraid to speak where I work."" ""I'm afraid.""
How are you not afraid?
MS. CHENEY: Well, I think that — that the point you're making is a really important one. Think about what's happened in our country, the level of vicious, vitriolic attack.
You know, when — when Donald Trump says that his political opponents are the enemy within and when he contemplates deploying force against them, the response that we all have should not be to be so afraid we don't act. It should be: Vote him out. Defeat him. Defeat him. Vote for Vice President Harris. (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And, Maria, I'm going to add to that.
MS. SHRIVER: Yeah.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I — I would add to that an additional point, which is — and don't think it's a sick sense of humor and relegate it to simply being that. You know, I've said many times, I do believe Donald Trump to be an unserious man, but the consequences of him ever being in the White House again are brutally serious.
And — and take it from the people who know him best: his former chief of staff when he was president; two former Defense secretaries; his national security advisor; and, of course, his vice president, who have all in one way or another used the word that he is ""unfit"" to be president again and is dangerous.
Listen to the report that — what his former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a general, said about him: that he is ""fascist to the core.""
And these are people who were in his administration, who worked closely with him in the Oval Office and the Situation Room.
And so, I would caution us also — you know, because some people find it humorous what he says and — and think it's just silly. But understand how brutally serious it is.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Lock him up!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, the courts will take care of that. We'll take care of November, yes. (Applause.) (Laughs.) We'll take care of November.
But it is brutally serious, because to — to the congresswoman's point, anyone has — who has openly said, as he has, that he would terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States — never again. (Applause.)
MS. SHRIVER: So, Madam Vice President, I wanted to ask you — several people that I talked to in preparation for this — when I asked them, they said, ""Well, I — I want to vote for the vice president, but I just don't feel like I know her. I don't know enough about her. I see the ads, but I don't have a feel for her."" What are three things you can tell this audience about you that aren't in your ads, that people aren't telling people on the robocalls, that perhaps they just wouldn't know that might give them a feeling for who you are as a woman?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: How much time do we have? (Laughter.)
MS. SHRIVER: We're at the kitchen table.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I — I have lived a full life. (Laughter.)
I am a wife. I am a mother. I am a sister. I am a godmother. I love to cook.
I started my career as a prosecutor, in large part — there are many reasons but one very fundamental is, when I was young, one of my best friends in high school, I learned, was being molested by her stepfather. And I told her, when I learned, she had to come live with us. I talked to my mother about it. ""Of course, she has to come live with us,"" and she did. And I decided I wanted to take on a career and a life that was about protecting the most vulnerable.
I served as attorney general of California two terms. I was the — the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state in the country. And doing that work, it included prosecuting transnational criminal organizations for the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings. I did the work of taking on the big banks during the foreclosure crisis and delivered $20 billion for homeowners who had been targeted with predatory lending practices. (Applause.) I took on the big pharmaceutical companies on behalf of consumers.
As vice president of the United States, my priorities have been many, including, to your point, the work that you and I have done over the years focusing on women's health. One of my priorities is — has been maternal mortality.
But I — I have only had one client in my career: the people. And my belief is that there is great nobility in public service if one understands that they hold the office in the public trust. It is not about personal power. It is about what you can do that lifts up the condition of people.
And there is so much about how I think about my responsibility, and I am here to ask for your vote — is that I do — I intend to be a president for all Americans, understanding that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.
And this era that was kind of initiated by Donald Trump has not only been exhausting, it has been harmful to us as a nation. The notion that a president of the United States would encourage Americans to point fingers at each other, that — that there would be a suggestion that we are a divided country, that — instead of knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us.
I have, as vice president, met over 150 world leaders: presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings. My most recent overseas trips as vice president — which were relatively close to, then, the election — our allies have expressed real concern.
I've shared this before, but, you know, when we walk in a room representing the United States of America, we should walk in that room, especially leaders, chin up, shoulders back, knowing that we have the self-appointed and earned authority to talk about the importance of democracy and rule of law.
But the thing about being a role model — it's all role models who are here — people watch what you do to see if it matches up to what you say. People around the world are watching this election, I promise you. And my — one fear I have is I hope and I pray that we, the American people, understand not only what is at stake for us in this election but how much we mean to the rest of the world.
There is so much at stake in this election.
MS. SHRIVER: Liz Cheney, tell us real quick — I want to get to our first question. But you've been traveling with the vice president. You've been working with her. You've been spending human time with her. Tell the audience what you see that perhaps, you know, the camera doesn't get or the ads don't get so that they can get a sense of her that you have.
MS. CHENEY: Well, I — I think that what I can tell you is that what the vice president is saying about wanting to be a president for all Americans, caring deeply about this country, those are things that — that come across very, very clearly and very directly.
And — and, look, I — I'm a conservative. The very first campaign I ever volunteered in was for President Gerald Ford in 1976, and — and ever since then, I have been voting for Republicans. I've never voted for a Democrat. And —
MS. SHRIVER: Wow.
MS. CHENEY: And so, the — the fact that — that I — I believe so strongly that in this election — in this election, we need to elect the person who is the responsible adult — (laughter and applause) — and — and we need —
And — and there is a lot — both parties do it. There is a lot of vilification that goes on.
MS. SHRIVER: Yeah.
MS. CHENEY: And — and I think it's really important for people to — to think very carefully about the power that we're going to invest in the president of the United States and what it would mean to — to give that power to Donald Trump.
Don't take my word for who he is. Listen to him every day. Look at what he did. Remember that the people, as the vice president said, who are opposing him are the people who know him best, the people who worked most closely with him.
And so, I would just say I — I know that the vice president has had the range of experience, has — as vice president, as senator, as attorney general of California. She is supremely qualified to be president of the United States. I think there — there — sometimes there are some men who suggest that she's not. But if you look at her qualifications, there's no question. And that she's somebody that I know I can count on who will put the good of this country first, there's just no question. (Applause.)
MS. SHRIVER: Okay. I want to go — I want to go over here to Cecelia. Cecelia Borland, can you stand up? You have a question.
Cecelia grew up in Birmingham, Michigan, which was a Republican stronghold as she grew up. She now lives with her husband. They're raising two children in Berkley, Michigan, and she's here with a question for the vice president.
Q: Thank you both for coming to Michigan today for this important event. I'd like to start by saying, personally, thank you, Representative Cheney, for — to you and your father for exemplifying putting country over party. (Applause.)
And, Madam Vice President, I hope you had a wonderful birthday yesterday.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughter.) Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you.
Q: From the shootings at Oxford High School to my alma mater, Michigan State University, to an attack at a kid's splash pad this summer just a few miles away from here, the issue of gun violence hits very close to home for our community.
Just yesterday, I learned from our school district that my preschooler will be going through his first active shooter drill.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
Q: As a gun violence survivor and mother of two young children, the issue of gun violence and the safety of my children in their schools and in our community is my top priority.
Madam Vice President, if you are elected president and there is a Republican majority in Congress, how will you work with them to make impactful and immediate progress around gun violence, especially in our children's schools?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. Thank you —
MS. SHRIVER: Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — Cecelia. And thank you and — for your courage to speak up about this.
So — well, we have done it, actually, in the last four years. We had a bipartisan group of — of folks in Congress who came together for the Safer Communities Act, which is the first meaningful piece of gun safety legislation in 30 years. And so, it's a good step, and it really does tell us that we have a will within the United States Congress to work in a bipartisan way. And — and then-Congresswoman Cheney was one of those Republicans that actually voted for it.
I — this is how I think of the issue. And it is through the — the lens of many experiences, including act- — I'm so sorry about your kids going through active shooter drills. It's — our kids did. It's traumatic that our children — you know, growing up, I'll speak for myself, we had fire drills. Right?
Our children are now learning how to keep themselves safe if there's an active shooter at their school.
I did a tour last year of — of colleges — with college-aged kids, so I also did some trade schools. And I would ask the room — the auditorium would be packed — college-age kids — and I'd ask them, ""Raise your hand if at any point between kindergarten and 12th grade you had to endure an active shooter drill."" Almost every hand went up.
Our kids are growing up where they are learning that they may be unsafe in the classroom where they should be absorbing the wonders of the world.
One kid said to me, ""Yeah"" — we were talking about this — and said to me, ""Yeah, that's why I don't like going to fifth period."" I said, ""Why, sweetheart? Why don't you like going to fifth period?"" ""Because in that classroom, there's no closet,"" in which to hide.
So, we — when we think of this issue, we must also consider the trauma that is the trauma of — the direct trauma for those who have been directly affected by gun violence, including that to our kids who are in schools across our country doing this — not to mention their teachers, who want to teach and not also have to worry about will they be able to physically protect a child from a bullet.
Here's how I think about it in terms of the macro point. We have been pushing, as a country, I think, a false choice that suggests you're either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone's guns away. And that's a false choice.
I'm in favor of the Second Amendment. I have talked about the fact both Tim Walz and I are gun owners. I also believe we need reasonable gun safety laws, assault weapons bans, red flag laws, universal background checks. (Applause.) And — and reports say that the majority of NRA members agree on, for example, universal background checks.
What is a universal background check? It's just common sense. Here's what it is: You just might want to know before someone can buy a lethal weapon whether they've been found by a court to be a danger to themselves or others. You just might want to know. It's common sense. (Applause.) We need commonsense gun safety laws.
And I will continue — I've done it throughout my career — work with all of our colleagues across the aisle. And I know that we can make progress.
But this is not — I'm not trying to take anybody's guns away from them. But we need reasonable gun safety laws.
MS. SHRIVER: Okay. I want to come back to the issue of public safety in a minute. But first we want to go to Martin. Thank you, Cecelia, very much. Martin Howrylak. He's a former Republican member of the Michigan House of Representatives, and he's here with a question about national security.
Q: Well, thank both of you for being here this afternoon. I really appreciate your coming to the state of Michigan to — to be here. I would like to ask: What can the U.S. do politically, economically, or militarily to deter Russia from continuing its war on the independent nation of Ukraine while simultaneously strengthening our own U.S. security interests?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Martin.
MS. SHRIVER: Go ahead.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, I was actually in Munich at the Munich Security Conference delivering a speech when I first met with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, and it was just days before Russia invaded.
I've now met with President Zelenskyy, I think, seven times, because the United States has rightly taken a position as a leader — a global leader on international rules and norms — that we must stand in support of one of the most important international rules and norms, which is the importance of protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity, the importance of standing strong in opposition to the notion that, in this case, Russia would attempt to change borders by force, to invade another nation — a sovereign nation by force.
And sadly, there is a huge difference between my opponent and me on this very fundamental issue.
Back to the conversation about — there was a time when we used to — there was a phrase that I'll paraphrase that, basically, politics ends at the — at the sea line, at the — at the — you know, at the — the boundaries of our country, that there are certain things — in particular, the matters of national security — where it's not about partisanship; it's about where should America stand in terms of supporting our allies and standing for certain principles.
I'll — I'll give you, as a — as a point of reference for me in terms of how I feel about this, on the partisan issue.
I — for the four years that I was in the United States Senate, my favorite committee was the Senate Intelligence Committee. And I served on that committee, and we would meet in a room that's called a SCIF. And it's — it's basically a — (laughs) — it's a very secure room. No press, with all due respect, is allowed in. No cameras. Everyone has to leave their cell phone outside.
It's a bipartisan committee, and we would go in that room and receive classified information from America's intelligence community, sometimes our military leaders, about hot spots around the world and threats to our national security. And when we went in that room — and this is why it was my favorite committee — people would take off their suit jacket, roll up their sleeves, have a cup of coffee on the table. And we weren't Democrats or Republicans; we were Americans.
And that is so important on a number of issues we are discussing this afternoon but, in particular, on national security.
My opponent, however, has made it a thing of his to admire dictators and autocrats around the world. He exchanged love letters with Kim Jong Un. Remember that? He has openly praised the president of Russia.
Most recently, the report is, in the height of COVID — remember everyone was scrambling to get their hands on COVID tests? Remember when Americans were dying by the hundreds every day? And Donald Trump secretly sent COVID tests to the president of Russia for his personal use.
He has said — Donald Trump — ""I will solve the matter of Ukraine and Russia in a day."" Read through and understand what he is saying. He would surrender. He would have Ukraine surrender its fight against an aggressor violating its sovereignty.
If Donald Trump were president, Vladimir Putin will be sitting in Kyiv. And understand what that would mean for America and our standing around the world.
But thankfully, there has been bipartisan support — and to your point of what — where you stand — on this very fundamental issue. But this is a — this is a very vivid example of what is at stake in this election. Because Donald Trump has been very clear: He would give away the shop. He has been manipulated and is so clearly able to be manipulated by favor and flattery, including from dictators and autocrats around the world.
And America knows that that is not how we stand. That is not how we fight. We fight in favor of our strength and our role as a leader in bringing the Allies together and standing for foundational and fundamental principles.
MS. SHRIVER: Congressman Cheney — (applause) — I know, kind of, the issue of national security is one of the big reasons you're here and supporting the vice president. Can you expand on that answer and add your thoughts to it?
MS. CHENEY: Yeah. You know, I think that if — if you look at where the Republican Party is today, there's been a really dangerous embrace of isolationism, a dangerous embrace of tyrants.
The president, you know, even just today, he heaps praise on the world's most evil people while he attacks, you know, with venom, his political opponents here at home.
And, you know, the — the reality is that since the end of World War II, America has led. And we've led — and that has been necessary to defend our freedom. And we can't do it by ourselves, though. We need our allies.
And when Donald Trump says that he's going to withdraw from NATO, when he invites Vladimir Putin to invade NATO, when he suggests that it is Zelenskyy's fault that Ukraine was invaded, I mean that is — that i- —
For anybody who is a Republican who is thinking that, you know, they might vote for Donald Trump because of national security policy, I ask you, please, please study his national security policy. Not only is it not Republican, it's dangerous. And without allies, America will find our very freedom and security challenged and threatened.
And one final point on this: Don't think that Congress can stop him.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MS. CHENEY: People say, ""Well, you know what, he can't really do the worst, you know, because Congress will step in."" All he has to do is what he's doing — is say, ""I won't fulfill our NATO treaty obligations,"" and — and NATO begins to unravel.
So, it is — it is an incredibly dangerous thing to think about a foreign policy, a national security policy led by somebody who is — is as unstable as Donald Trump is. And it's a risk we just simply can't take as a nation.
MS. SHRIVER: Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I'm going to add for emphasis that — let's also be clear about on the subject, specifically of Ukraine, Donald Trump's approach would be to surrender. Understand what that would mean. That is signaling to the president of Russia he can get away with what he has done.
Understand — look at the map — Poland would be next. NATO, our Allies, are — the reason that they have been so thankful for the position of strength we have taken in bringing the Allies together is because they are fully aware of and remember — to the congresswoman's point — World War II. Remember, this — this concept of isolation — we were once there as a nation, and then Pearl Harbor happened.
Let's remember recent history. Europe remembers it well. We — then when we got attacked, Pearl Harbor, we jumped in, and it is because America jumped in that we were ultimately able to win that war, and it should be a constant reminder to us — we have to remember history — that isolationism, which is exactly what Donald Trump is pushing — pull out of NATO, abandon our friends — isolationism is not insulation. It is not insulation. It will not insulate us from harm in terms of our national security.
So, I say that to emphasize a point that the congresswoman made, and the other point I'd make is also check out where he's been on how he thinks about America's military and service members. One of the great, great American heroes, a prisoner of war, John McCain. Remember how he talked about John McCain? He said he didn't like him because he got caught.
You look — he's called members of our military ""suckers"" and ""losers."" And then look at how some of the highest-ranking members of our military, including what I mentioned earlier, the chairman — the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a dedicated member, leader in our mil- — in America's military, how he has assessed Donald Trump — fascism ""to his core.""
So, there we are.
MS. SHRIVER: There are your talking points for the kitchen table. (Applause.)
Our final question is from Courtney. Courtney, can you stand? Courtney is — Courtney Gabbara Agrusa is a wife, a mom, an attorney, and she's a proud Chaldean, and she is here with a question. Courtney.
Q: Thank you so much. Good evening, Madam Vice President Harris and Representative Cheney. My name is Courtney Gabbara Agrusa, and I am a first-generation Chaldean American. Chaldeans are Indigenous Iraqis who are Catholic, and we are predominantly in the metro Detroit area. Chaldeans are a very close-knit community, but the recent political climate has really begun to divide us.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
Q: While I know that you have discussed several bipartisan proposals over the course of your campaign, what would you say to people like myself who are part of these traditionally conservative communities who want to move forward, but are feeling the pref- — the pressures of the political divide?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. And I've actually met with — with members and leaders in the Chaldean community, and thank you for being here.
You know, I think that there is something at stake that is about core values, as well as what is at stake in terms of the risk and the danger. And I would offer you an example of what I think would be an important issue that would affect the Chaldean community and all Americans, for example, the issue of — of how we think about health care in America.
So, I know enough about the culture and to know that it is reflective of who we are as Americans in general. We respect our elders; we take care of them. So, I will share with you a specific proposal that is an extension of how I think about things.
I — actually a personal story, I took care of my mother when she was sick. And for anyone taking care of or who has taken care of an elder relative, you know what that is. It's about trying to cook something they feel like eating. It is trying to find clothes that don't irritate their skin or help them put on a sweater. It's about trying to figure out something you can say that will bring a smile to their face or make them laugh. It's about dignity.
And we now have, in particular in our country, a lot of people doing that and also raising young kids. We call them the sandwich generation, right in the middle. It's a lot. And the way the system currently works — well, God willing, you may have enough resources, you can hire somebody to come in and help.
If not, you may have to spend down all of your savings to be able to qualify for Medicaid or you may have to quit your job to be able to do what you need to do to take care of your children and take care of your relative — your older relative. That's just not right, and it's not fair.
So, part of my proposal and the plan is that we're going to now reconfigure so that Medicare covers home health care for our seniors, right? It's about dignity. (Applause.)
So, in addition to everything that we've discussed already about national security, what is at stake — something like this, because I absolutely do believe America is ready for a new generation of leadership that is taking on issues clear-eyed about what is going on that affects everybody — it doesn't matter their political party; issues that are fundamentally about dignity, also about economic issues; and taking it on in a way that we relieve the American people of the burdens that get in the way of productivity and a certain quality of life. And this is one example of that.
I believe we need to have an economy that I call an opportunity economy, where everyone has the opportunity to thrive — not just get by but get ahead.
And this is one example I would offer under the broader point, which is about, let's move forward, taking on problems from a commonsense approach that is about just practical work.
Look, I am a capitalist. I am a pragmatic capitalist. I will work as I have with the private sector. I believe we have to invest in America's economy and in America's industry and America's entrepreneurs, and we can, at the same time, take care of those that are the most in need of just a little support to be able to not just get by but get ahead.
MS. SHRIVER: Thank you, Courtney.
Liz, I just want to — we have two minutes left — (applause) — and when you hear the phrase a ""new way forward,"" when you hear ""country over party,"" what does that mean to you?
We're two weeks out, what does a new way forward mean for families like everybody here, for your children, my children, everybody's children, young men?
MS. CHENEY: Yeah, I —
MS. SHRIVER: What is it like?
MS. CHENEY: I think that, you know, we're — we're at a moment now where, when you think about America and — and the beacon of hope that we have been for so many years for so many communities, also how tremendously enriched we have been by communities — immigrants who want to come here and build a life, all of that depends upon fundamentally defending the rule of law, fundamentally defending our Constitution. That's — that's what makes all of our opportunity and our freedom possible.
And — and at the same time that we're that beacon for the world, you know, it's also because — because we're a good nation —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MS. CHENEY: — and because you know when — when you — when you look at who our leader is going to be, what — what Donald Trump represents is — is, in many ways, just cruel and — and not — not the kind of dignity and — and the kind of person that we all want to be able to look up to.
But — but what I would say is that if people are uncertain, if people are thinking, ""Well, you know, I'm a conservative, I don't know that I can support Vice President Harris,"" I would say I don't know if anybody is more conservative than I am. (Laughter.) And — and I understand the most conservative value there is is to defend the Constitution. And if we don't come together to do that then — (applause) —
And so, just to — to finish that, I would say, to me, a new way forward is this: It's what you're seeing up here. It's having a president who will listen, having a president who will say, ""I'm not, you know, necessarily sure I agree with you on this issue or that issue, but let's talk about it.""
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MS. CHENEY: ""Why do you want, you know, that policy? Why do you believe that?"" Someone who is willing to honor and respect all perspectives and points of views. And there's only one candidate in this race who does that, and that's Vice President Harris. (Applause.)
MS. SHRIVER: In fact, a lot of polling of undecided voters who call themselves ""the exhausted majority"" said, I just want leaders who listen —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MS. SHRIVER: — to one another. I just want leaders who speak respectfully to one another. I want to see decency. I want to see people I can look up to. And, unfortunately, that's considered a new way forward as the — as Representative Cheney —
MS. CHENEY: Yeah, let's do that. Let's do that.
MS. SHRIVER: Yeah, let's do that.
MS. CHENEY: Yeah, let's do that.
MS. SHRIVER: Let's make that a way forward.
The final word, Madam Vice President. You know, everybody I talked to says, you know, ""I have to turn off the news. I can't read anything. I'm meditating. I'm doing yoga. I'm doing — I'm so anxious. I just don't even know. I'm eating gummies."" All kinds of things, you know? (Laughter.)
What are you doing? What are you doing —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Not eating gummies. (Laughter and applause.)
MS. SHRIVER: Okay, we got that clear. But how do you — I mean, how do you handle this — the anxiety, the stress, the turmoil? Everybody is freaked out. I — I talked to the gentleman up there, and he's like, ""I'm so scared.""
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MS. SHRIVER: A woman was like, ""I'm so anxious. I can't sleep."" Do you sleep?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You know, I wake up in the middle of the night usually these days, to be honest with you, but I work out every morning. I — I think that's really important to just kind of — you know, mind, body, and spirit.
But let me — let me just say this —
MS. SHRIVER: No, say more about that.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we — but I —
MS. SHRIVER: Say more.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — but — I will. I work out. I try to eat well. You know, I love my family, and I make sure that I talk to the kids and my husband every day. We've been — Doug and I've been kind of tr- — you know, traveling. We're trying to cover a lot of ground, so we're not with each other every day these days, but my family grounds me in every way.
But let me, if I can just speak to the — what people are feeling. You — we cannot despair. We cannot despair. You know, the nature of a democracy is such that I think there's a duality.
On the one hand, there's an incredible strength when our democracy is intact, an incredible strength in what it does to protect the freedoms and rights of its people. Oh, there's great strength in that. And it is very fragile. It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it. And so, that's the moment we're in.
And I say, do not despair, because in a democracy, as long as we can keep it — in our democracy, the people, every individual has the power to make a decision about what this will be, and that's — and so let's not feel powerless. Let's not let the som- — and I get it — overwhelming nature of this all make us feel powerless, because then we have been defeated, and that's not our character as the American people.
We are not one to be defeated. We rise to a moment, and we stand on broad shoulders of people who have fought this fight before for our country. And in many ways, let us look at the challenge then that we are being presented and not be overwhelmed by it. The baton is now in our hands to fight for — not against, but for — this country we love.
That's what we have the power to do. So, let's own that — dare I say, be joyful in what we will do in the process of owning that, which is knowing that we can and will build community and coalitions and remind people that we're all in this together. Let's not let the overwhelming nature of this strip us of our strength.
That's how I feel about this. (Applause.) You know, that's how I feel about this. You know? Yeah.
MS. SHRIVER: So, I want to — I want to thank everybody here. You heard from the vice president, from Congresswoman Cheney, do not despair. I think you got a great glimpse into who this woman is, who this woman is, what brings them together, why they're here, why they want to earn your vote, why they wanted to speak with you today.
And I want to leave you with this quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson that I think speaks to this moment. It says,
""Whatever course you decide upon, there is always someone to tell you that you're wrong. There are always difficulties arising which tempt you to believe that your critics are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to the end requires great courage.""
So, I leave you with that. All of you are courageous people. Do not despair.
Thank you so much for spending your time. Brava. (Applause.)

    Vice President of the United States: 2021-2025
  
  

  
    Remarks by the Vice President and Liz Cheney at a Campaign Event in Brookfield, Wisconsin
  


  

  
    October 21, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good evening, everyone. Good evening.
MR. SYKES: And, Vice President, wel- — welcome back to Wisconsin.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It is good to be back. You — you know, I — so, Tony Evers.
MR. SYKES: (Laughs.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's funny about his playlist. Is it really that long? (Laughter.)
MR. SYKES: No.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay.
Every time I — I land in Wisconsin — almost every time, Tony Evers, the governor, will meet me on the tarmac. And because I did live in Wisconsin when I was five years old, every — (applause) — he will say, ""Welcome home."" So, I do feel and have a connection to Wisconsin and feel a sense of connection.
MR. SYKES: Actually, we all have connections to Wisconsin, which — which makes this event, I think, so important, with 15 days to go.
So, let's just dive right into all of this. There are actually undecided voters out there.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MR. SYKES: And there are undecided voters here.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MR. SYKES: People who have never voted for a Democrat. Moderates, conservatives who voted for people named Bush and Cheney and Ford and Reagan —
MS. CHENEY: Yay. (Claps.) (Laughter.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MR. SYKES: And — and Bob Dole. Wow, that's a — that's throwback, isn't it?
But I guess the question is: What is your pitch to them? Why should they do something they've never done before? Why should they cross over party lines and vote for you?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, I start from the belief, based on the lived experience, that the vast majority of us have more in common than what separates us.
I also know that you all are here spending time that you could be spending doing a number of other things, with all of the obligations you each have, and you are here because we, together, love our country. We love our country, and we believe in the foundational principles that are at stake in this election.
I believe that when we think about who we are as the American people, there is more we have in common than what separates us when we think about what is at stake in terms of our democracy, rule of law, the Constitution of the United States, national security, the standing of our country in the context of the world. All of that is at stake.
And I will share with you, Charlie, when I was in the Senate for — for those four years that I was there, my favorite committee was the Senate Intelligence Committee, and I'm going to tell you why. We would walk into that meeting in a SCIF, which is a — a secure room. We'd have to leave our cell phones outside. The press, with all due respect, were not allowed in. No cameras.
People would walk in, Democrats and Republicans, take off their suit jacket, roll up their sleeves, and we'd dispense with who was a Republican and who was a Democrat. We were all Americans. We were all in that room with one singular purpose: to concern ourselves as our highest priority with the security and well-being of the United States of America.
I think those things are at stake in this election. (Applause.)
MR. SYKES: Congresswoman Cheney, you know how hard this is, though. You know how hard it is to break away from tribal loyalty to do something you haven't done before. So, I'd like you to address that as well.
Lindsey Graham was on television yesterday saying, ""What do you 'Never Trump' Republicans — you know, what — what are you thinking of? How could you possibly do all of this?""
There are a lot of people who are listening to us who may be disillusioned with what's happening with the Republican Party, but they w- — they don't they — they — they're afraid of paying the price, because there is a cost to all of that.
So, what do you say to those Americans?
MS. CHENEY: Well, don't listen to Lindsey Graham. Number one. (Laughter and applause.) It's good life advice, actually.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.)
MS. CHENEY: But what I say is that, at the — what undergirds everything that we are as a nation — everything that we are as a nation is the rule of law and it's our Constitution.
And when you — when you look at what Donald Trump did after the last election, when you look at the cruelty that's involved in someone who watches an attack on the United States Capitol, an attack conducted by people in his name, and refuses for over three hours to tell the mob to leave — I mean, I really — people just need to think about what that — that — that's — that's depravity. He watched the attack happen, and people kept asking him, ""Please tell the people to leave."" And law enforcement officers were being brutally beaten and the Capitol was being assaulted, and he would not tell people to leave for over three hours.
That cruelty is the same cruelty that we see when he lies about the federal government's disaster response, when he puts people's lives at risk because he won't tell the truth. He's a man who's unfit to be the president of this good and honorable and great nation.
And so, I've spent a lot of time working — before I was elected to Congress — in countries around the world that — that weren't free or where people were trying to achieve their freedom, and I know how fragile — how fragile this — this can be, how fragile democracy can be.
And so, in — in this election, we have a choice. We have the choice of somebody, in Vice President Harris, who you know is going to uphold the rule of law. You know that she's going to lead this country with a sincere heart. You know that she is going to always be thinking about what is best for this nation. We might not agree on every issue, but — but she is somebody that you can trust and someone that our children can look up to. And I think it's so important for us to cast the vote for Vice President Harris this time around. (Applause.)
MR. SYKES: You know, Vice — Vice President, I w- — I was thinking about one of your social media posts recently where you go through all the things that Donald Trump has bailed out of: that he won't debate you, that he won't — that he won't do interviews, that he's refusing to release certain information. And — and you asked an interesting question: What is he hiding?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MR. SYKES: So, what, in fact, is he hiding?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, I — I wonder what is he hiding. I also wonder what his staff is trying to hide by — by preventing or suggesting he not debate me again, not do these interviews. It is the norm, as you know, that presidential nominees will do a ""60 Minutes"" interview. He has refused to do that. He is pulling out of interviews left, right, and center.
And I think that we — what we see about him in public, whether it be his rallies or, as you said, the — the — would it — would it be called a — just a solo dance? I — I don't — I — (laughter).
MR. SYKES: I don't know that is has a — I don't even know if it has a name to it.
MS. CHENEY: ""Dance"" is really generous.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: What — (laughs). Yes.
MR. SYKES: Yeah, the word ""dance"" would be generous.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: What — what that was.
I — I think it does lead us and it should lead us to observe that he is increasingly unstable.
But you don't have to take my word for it. Listen to the people who know him best, the people who worked with him in the White House, in the Oval Office, in the Situation Room: his former chief of staff; two former secretaries of Defense, his secretaries of Defense; his former national security advisor; and, of course, his former vice president. And they have each talked about the — the chief of staff — that Donald Trump has contempt for the Constitution of the United States.
Not only has that been said by a former chief of staff of the former president, but we know he has openly talked about his intention to terminate the Constitution of the United States.
I have taken that oath six times: as district attorney twice — elected and reelected; as attorney general of the largest state, in California, twice; as a United States senator; and actually now as vice president. And the congresswoman and I have talked about that. That is an oath one must take seriously. It is a duty to defend and honor and uphold the Constitution of the United States.
He has said he would terminate it. Anyone who wants to be president of the United States should never again be able to stand behind the seal of the president of the United States, having said they would terminate the Constitution of the United States. (Applause.)
And, again, most recently, the report is that the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a decorated general, said of Donald Trump that he is ""fascist to the core."" These are the people who know him best, people who worked with him.
And so, yes, we can talk about that moment on stage of the music and all that, but I think it's very important that we acknowledge, and I have said publicly, Donald Trump is an unserious man, and the consequences of him ever being president of the United States again are brutally serious — brutally serious.
I — to — to the congresswoman's point, I have now, as vice president of the United States, met over 150 world leaders — presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings — many of them, multiple times; we are on a first-name basis — most of them allies in connection with NATO, and — and I've met with them in connection with our standing, rightly, with Ukraine. The world is watching this election, and our allies are worried, because the reality is that when we, as the United States of America, walk in these rooms around the world, we walk in chin up, shoulders back, with the earned and self-appointed authority to talk about the importance of democracy and rule of law.
And being a role model — this is a room of role models — we know, as a role model, people watch what you do to see if it matches up to what you say.
One of my very real fears, Charlie, to be candid, is I hope that we, as the American people, fully understand how important America is to the world. I hope we really, really understand that — (applause) — because this is about what will happen to and — and with us as Americans, but it will impact people around the world.
MR. SYKES: Let me follow up on that, Congresswoman, because I was on a podcast recently with — with another pundit who was saying that she was afraid that America was sleepwalking into authoritarianism, that American voters were not sufficiently alarmed. And as the vice president just said, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff just said that Donald Trump was the most dangerous threat facing the country.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MR. SYKES: Do Americans — in this last 15 days, do they understand that? And what has to happen in the next two weeks for them to really understand the danger?
MS. CHENEY: Yeah, I — I think that they — I think they do. And, you know, one of the things I — I remind people is that although not every Republican who is casting a vote for Vice President Harris will say publicly that they are — there's clearly, you know, a threat associated with that in some instances — but — but millions will. And — and they will do that for a whole range of reasons, but — but what you mentioned is so important.
I mean, when I think about — you know, I — the first time I ever voted was for Ronald Reagan. I've known presidents well. Obviously, particularly, I know a vice president well — (laughter) — in addition to Vice President Harris. And — and I watch how our presidents have operated. And even when there have been presidents that we have potentially disagreed with on issues, they've respected the Constitution.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MS. CHENEY: I mean, think about the 2000 election and how close that was and what Vice President Gore did in — in his concession speech and in ensuring that we had the peaceful transfer of power.
And so, I — I would just urge people — again, you don't have to — to take my word for it, but — but look at what the people closest to Donald Trump are saying about him. Look at the testimony of the leaders of his Justice department, the leaders of his campaign, the most senior officials in his White House. Look at their testimony in front of the Select Committee. You know, they're the ones that — that told us everything that we know about his plan to overturn the last election, about what he did watching the attack from his dining room.
We've never faced a threat like this before, and I — I think it's so important for people to realize this republic only survives if we protect it, and that means putting partisan politics aside and standing up for the Constitution and for what's right and loving our country more. (Applause.)
MR. SYKES: Do — do you — do you think we'll be hearing more from some of those folks in the next 15 days — the generals, the chiefs of staff, the people who really understand exactly how unfit Donald Trump is?
MS. CHENEY: I do. I also think that — you know, that they have been very clear so far.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MS. CHENEY: I mean, you've had — you've had hundreds of national security officials who served in Republican administrations endorse the vice president —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Publicly, yeah.
MS. CHENEY: Yeah. And all of the things that — that — you know, the fact that these people aren't endorsing — the fact that Vice President Pence, who was the most loyal person there was to Donald Trump — he won't endorse him because he knows Donald Trump asked him to violate his oath of office.
Now, that should also give you a lot of pause about J.D. Vance. J.D. Vance is there because he will do what Donald Trump wants, and that makes him a particular danger to the republic as well.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And — and I'll add to that point: Understand also what happened in the last few months when the Supreme Court essentially told the former president he will be immune from anything he does in office. So, whereas, before, there was at least some threat of consequence and accountability, that no longer exists.
And to the congresswoman's point, imagine Donald Trump — based on everything we know about him and everything we see now and before — imagine him with no guardrails, because all of those folks who worked with him before, they're not — those who held him back, who attempted to ensure that he would follow the law are no longer there. And — and we have the Supreme Court decision, so the stakes are very high.
MR. SYKES: Okay. Let's go to the audience for some questions. We — we have some undecided voters who have some questions for you, Madam Vice President.
Let's go to Lisa Brockman from Madison. Lisa is a small-business owner.
Q: Hi.
MR. SYKES: Good evening.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi.
Q: Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on reproductive freedom.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
Q: And I am — come from a conservative, Christian, pro-life family, and I was a Republican until Donald Trump's presidency. (Laughs.) Like most Americans, I believe in a woman's right to choose. And with the overturning of Roe v. Wade, my 21-year-old daughter now has fewer rights than her mother or her grandmothers.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
Q: I no longer recognize the Republican Party. They have introduced bills for everything from restricting birth control to bringing homicide charges for abortion. It is such an extreme, radical agenda by any standards, and it seems less about the unborn and more about controlling women.
So, my question is: What are your thoughts on this extremism, and how can we restore those fundamental human rights that have been taken away from the American women?
MR. SYKES: Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, to your point, when Donald Trump was president, he hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe, and they did as he intended. And now there are at least 20 states in our country that have criminalized health care providers, to your point.
I mean, in Texas, the — the law provides for prison for life for a doctor, nurse, health care provider for doing what they believe is health care and in the best interest of their patient.
Punishing women. I was actually just this week, just a few days ago, in the state of Georgia with the mother of a young woman who died because of Georgia's abortion ban, and she had to go to another state. And it's a long and very tragic story that did not have to be.
And here's how I think about this issue. One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree that the government — these folks in a state capitol, much less Donald Trump — should not be making this decision for her. If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government.
And — and I also have found, though, since the two years that the Dobbs decision came down, that this happened, I have had conversations with a number of people who were opposed to abortion and remain opposed to it but did not intend for the harm that we are seeing to happen. And I think as this has — this decision came down and we are seeing the harm, there are more and more people who are agreeing that this should not be the government making this decision for women and their families.
And the way that we will address this is, eventually, Congress needs to pass a law restoring those protections, and we need to agree that, in our society, you know, we should not have laws that are treating people in a way that is causing such harm.
I'll give you another example of the harm that is going on. I started my career as a prosecutor. I have prosecuted everything from low-level offenses to homicides. But one of the reasons I became a prosecutor is because, when I was in high school, I learned that my best friend was being molested by her stepfather. And so, I said to her, ""You have to come live with us."" I called my mother. My mother said, ""Of course,"" and she did. And I made a decision early in my life that I wanted to do the work that was about protecting vulnerable people.
There are some of these bans that include no exception for rape or incest. I have specialized in those kinds of cases. And the — the notion that we would tell a survivor of a crime that is a violation to their body that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next — I mean, I think that's just unconscionable. I think it's immoral.
And so, this is one of the issues that is at play. And when this issue has been on the ballot, since the Dobbs decision came down, in so-called red states and so-called blue states, the American people have voted for freedom. (Applause.)
MR. SYKES: Congresswoman Cheney, I'd like to get your thoughts on this as well.
MS. CHENEY: Yeah. You know, I am — I'm pro-life, and I have been very troubled, deeply troubled by what I have watched happen in so many states since Dobbs. And I have been troubled by the extent to which you have women who, as the vice president said, in some cases, have died, who can't get medical treatment that they need because providers are worried about criminal liability.
You know, we're facing a situation today where I think that it's an untenable one. And I think that as we deal with issues like this one, having a president who understands how important compassion is, who understands that these shouldn't be political issues, that we ought to be able to have these discussions and say: You know what? Even if you are pro-life, as I am, I do not believe, for example, that the state of Texas ought to have the right, as they're currently suing to do, to get access to women's medical records.
I mean, there are some very fundamental and fundamentally dangerous things that have happened. And — and so, I think that it's crucially important for us to find ways to have the federal government play a role and protect women from some of the worst harms that we're seeing.
But — but, again, I just think that if you look at the difference in — in the way that Donald Trump is handling this issue — you know, Donald Trump, at one point, called for criminal penalties for women. Now, you know, he — he's been now trying to — to, you know, sort of be all over the place on this issue, although he expresses great pride for what's happened.
And — and I think the — the bottom line on this, as on so many other issues, is, you know, you just can't count on him. You cannot trust him. We've seen the man that he is. We've seen the cruelty. And America deserves much better. (Applause.)
MR. SYKES: Thank you. Thank you, Lisa.
So, we — we have another question. Carolyn Mitchell from Wauwatosa has a question for the vice president as well.
Q: Hi. I have concerns about the strength and the health of the Medicare and the Social Security system. There have been a lot of suggestions for improving or protecting it, some of them raising the age for full acceptance of Social Security. There's also the idea that we would end the cap on — on the Social Security tax. There is also the suggestion that we raise the tax rate on both Medicare and Social Security. And, of course, the last one is to reduce the benefits.
So, my question for you is: How can we protect the health of both Social Security and Medicare without reducing the benefits?
MR. SYKES: Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, first of all, thank you for your question. Actually, just today, I believe it was — within the last 24 hours or so — an independent review of Donald Trump's policy on Social Security has indicated that, under his policy, Social Security would become insolvent in six years.
And what I and you and, I think, most of us know is that we have many, many seniors in our country where their Social Security check is their only form of income. It's everything and the only thing they have to live on, to pay rent, groceries, all of that. And so, we must protect Social Security.
If you look at Donald Trump's Project 2025, the — the plan that they have if he is elected — or reelected president, it — it would attack Social Security. It would attack Medicare.
And back to the point about just what is in the interest of dignity. The president of the United States should have as one of their highest concerns the dignity of the American people and, in particular, those who have lived a productive life, who deserve to be able to retire and go into their senior years with the dignity of not worrying about whether they're going to have a roof over their head or be able to eat.
So, my plan includes what we need to do to strengthen the solvency of Social Security. It includes what we're going to need to do and work with Congress to make sure we're putting more into it. And it cannot be about cutting benefits, because right now, those benefits are barely adequate as it is.
What we must also do is continue to strengthen Medicare around what we've been working on, which is to allow Medicare to negotiate prescription medication costs for our seniors.
So, in the last four years, we have now capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors. This is a huge issue for so many who have otherwise either taken a bus trip to Canada to try and get their prescription medication — you're smiling; you know what I'm talking about — or — not that you have; I'm not suggesting that. (Laughter.) I'm not suggesting that. And we've also capped the cost of — of prescription medication at $2,000 a year for our seniors, understanding, again, that this is a related issue, which is what is causing our seniors to be on the verge of bankruptcy and — and homelessness, by the way.
The other work that we have to do is to deal with home health care and how Medicare is covering that.
So, part of my plan is — right now, the only way that there will be coverage for home health care is, generally speaking, Medicaid, which means that the family or the individual would have to spend down all of their savings to be able to be eligible for Medicaid. And, frankly, I think it's just — that's — that's wrong, and it's — it's just wrong.
You know, I took care of my mother when she was sick, and the work that needs to happen to support our seniors to be able to stay in their home, to be able to live a life with dignity should include that we will pay attention to the fact that not everybody can afford that help, not everyone has a family member who can do it.
And so, my plan includes having Medicare cover home health care work for seniors — (applause) — so that you can stay in your home, for example, and have someone who can prepare a meal and help you put on a sweater. But the — the core point being dignity and understanding that we should not have a society that allows or requires our seniors to — to go into poverty in order to qualify for the care that they may need that, I think, we — most would agree — should provide. (Applause.)
Thank you.
MR. SYKES: And we have another question from the audience, from Dan — Dan Voboril, who is a retired school teacher, taught at MPS, and now lives in Waukesha. Again, a genuinely undecided voter, I understand.
Q: Thank you. Good evening.
MS. CHENEY: Come on, Dan. (Laughter.)
Q: What did you say?
I was told I was going to be an alternate, so I was a little worried about getting my question. But —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Take your time. Take your time.
Q: This is a question that — I actually retired from MPS, but I currently teach, and I teach at a private Catholic school. I'm a Catholic, but I've also been pro-life, pro-choice depending. But I have five daughters, and I think it's my duty to continue — with the children I teach as well — to see that we need to respect women, and I've really come to the conclusion that this toxicity that exists is just rather embarrassing. And as a lifelong Republican, who I thought your father would be a great president —
MS. CHENEY: Thank you.
Q: — not to say George wasn't, but — (laughter) — but I've come to this realization, and it's — it's been very difficult. So, I'm just — my big question was, for the future of my children and also students that I encounter and try to show that we have to have some kind of civility like we did back in the — the '80s, when Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill, of course, could talk about things and solve problems, and now it's trying to get one better than the other.
And so, I'm just wondering, in your position now, how to convince people like me, who some of my siblings might be questioning what I'm doing here, but — (laughter) — I — I think, like you said, we have to be courageous, and that's what I'm trying to be. And so, what do you think we can do in the last 15 days — or you can, Madam Vice President — what you can do to try to get some of these people to cross over? I know you already said that some of them probably won't say who they're voting for, but — or something I could take with me to say, ""This sounds very good,"" or, ""We got to at least listen to this.""
MR. SYKES: To reduce the toxicity? Is that —
Q: Yes.
MR. SYKES: Okay.
MS. CHENEY: Yeah, I — I think that — that, you know, you've really put your finger on something that's so important, and you see it as a teacher. You know, any of us who are around young children — I see it as a mom. My kids aren't so young anymore, but — but, you know, the — when they look at how elected officials and, in particular, how Donald Trump is conducting himself now, that's — that's not — that's not a lesson that anybody would look up to.
And — and I think about it often from the perspective of the men and women who've worn the uniform of our country and who have sacrificed so much for our freedom, all of us have an obligation to be worthy of that sacrifice.
And in this — (applause) — you know, in this moment, there — there are millions of good and honorable people who Donald Trump has just fundamentally betrayed. And — and I think it's so important for — for people to think about this from the perspective of, you know, the decision to give somebody the power of the presidency means that you're handing someone the most awesome and significant power of any office anywhere in the world, and — and you have to choose people who have character, choose people of good faith.
You know, the — the framers knew this. The framers knew that — that it was so important that, you know, we take an oath but that also, fundamentally, you had to have people of character. And Donald Trump has proven he's not one of those people by his actions.
So, you know, what I — what I say to people is, look, for us to get back to a time where we are actually having policy debates and discussions and disagreements, we have to protect what undergirds all of this, and — and what undergirds all of it is the Constitution. And we have to be willing to say, as a nation, ""We're better than partisanship.""
We know — and I say this as someone who spent a lot of years engaged in partisan battles and — and there are important debates we have to have. But if — if we allow someone again — if we give him the power again to, you know, do all of the things he tells us he's going to do — he says he'll terminate the Constitution; he says he'll deploy the military against the ""enemy within"" — that — that is a risk that we just simply can't take as a nation. And — and I think that, you know, this vote, this election cycle, this time around has to be about so much more than partisanship.
And I will just end this by saying: And I also know because I have spent time with Vice President Harris, because I have come to understand what she believes about how she will govern, that she will be a president for all Americans, that she's committed to listening and committed to having viewpoints, some of which, you know, come from different ends of the political spectrum.
And — and if you think about how you conduct, you know, your life outside of politics, how we all conduct our everyday lives, those are the kinds of people that you trust. Those are the kinds of people you can work with. Like, if you wouldn't — if you wouldn't hire somebody to babysit your kids, like, you shouldn't make that guy the president of the United States. (Laughter and applause.) I mean, that's, like, pretty basic.
MR. SYKES: So — so —
MS. CHENEY: Thank you. Thank you.
MR. SYKES: Madam Vice President, that — this question goes to the heart of our discussion tonight, because it's almost — it is not about politics. It's not about left versus right. We're talking about the culture and the impact, the coarsening of the culture, the way in which we have been taught to fear and hate one another, and how our —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MR. SYKES: — debates have just devolved into sort of trolling one another. How do we get back from that?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, I think that Dan raised — and, Charlie, your point is — is really also hitting on we have to tap into and — and rejoice, frankly, in the spirit of who we are as Americans. And we are an ambitious people. We have aspirations. We have dreams. We are optimistic by nature. And we, I think, value certain qualities in our leaders.
To your point as — being a teacher, all of — those of us who are parents or parent in any form, the — the notion over the last several years coming from Trump and those who follow him, meaning people like who he's running with — not his voters, but just others — the notion that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down is just wrongheaded.
I think most of us would agree that the — that the real measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. I think most of us would agree — (applause) — and most of us would agree that it is — when we talk about character, it is the sign of strong character to have empathy, to have some level of concern and care about the well-being of other people and then to do something about that.
And I think there's so much about this election that calls into question whether we are on a track with a Donald Trump as president to actually teach and to — and to show our children our definition of a leader, and is that it.
One of the issues that I think has resulted in the kind of toxicity that you have been describing is that he tends to encourage us as Americans to point our fingers at each other. That's not in our best interest. The vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.
We are stronger as a nation when we are working toward a common goal, at least on the most basic, fundamental priorities.
And I think in this election, you can look at, for example, how he presents in his — in his events to know that he really does not have a plan for America that is about investing in our future, investing in our children, investing in — in our economies and new industries, investing in our relationships around the world. It's all about himself and his personal grievances. And do we want a president of the United States who spends full time plotting revenge while they sit in the Oval Office or a president who is actually focused on the American people?
I would also say, as a — as a point that I think the congresswoman exemplifies in so many ways, the strength of our democracy requires a strong two-party system. It really does. (Applause.) It requires that we have healthy debate — that we have healthy debate based on — you know, based in logic and fact and that we — we debate it out — have good, vigorous debates — have a good fight over policy. That's good for democracy. But not to point our fingers and call each other names over trivial, petty grievances.
So, I think all of that is at stake in this election, and — and tapping into the commonalities that we have around some of these fundamental principles, I think, is going to be key.
MR. SYKES: Well, that's why the stakes are so high, right? Because the presidency is a role model, but America is a role model to the rest of the world.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes.
MR. SYKES: So, in the very short amount of time we have left, Congresswoman Cheney, just talk a little bit more about the — the stakes for the world. We haven't talked about the stakes for the future of Ukraine, NATO, of all the other democracies who are looking to us.
MS. CHENEY: They're so, so high, Charlie. And, you know, America's safety and security depends upon America leading, and it depends upon allies.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MS. CHENEY: And when you have someone who is erratic and chaotic and unstable, that puts all of us at risk.
I — I tell people often — you know, I spend a lot of time working on national security issues. And when people that I know in the — in the Republican Party tell me they might be considering voting for Trump from a national security perspective, I ask them: Go look at his national security policies. Please, go look at them, because what he's proposing in terms of withdrawing from NATO; welcoming Vladimir Putin to attack our NATO Allies; praising — he — he praises Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea, and President Xi of China and Putin of Russia. And if you listen to him, he doesn't just praise those people generally. He praises them for their cruelty —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yep.
MS. CHENEY: — for their tyranny.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yep.
MS. CHENEY: That's not who we are as a nation. It's not who we are.
And the world needs us to be better. And our own security and our own freedom requires that we have a president who understands America has to lead and that our strength comes both from our greatness and also from our goodness. And that's Vice President Harris. (Applause.)
MR. SYKES: And you have the last word.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And — and just to — thank you. Thank you.
MR. SYKES: You get the last word.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But — but just as a point of emphasis on this important point: Understand that this is an individual, Donald Trump, who is easily manipulated by flattery, and we've seen that. We've — don't forget he — he dared to even consider vi- — inviting the Taliban to Camp David. Remember all this. The love letters with Kim Jong Un.
Let's remember what we just most recently — what was reported. During the height of COVID, Americans were dying by the hundreds a day. Nobody could get their hands on COVID tests. You remember what that was. During that time, he secretly sent COVID tests to Vladimir Putin for his personal use.
On the issue of Ukraine, he says, ""Oh, well, I'd solve that in a day."" Well, I don't think we as Americans think that the president of the United States should solve an issue like that through surrender, and understand that's what would happen. (Applause.) Understand that's what would happen. Vladimir Putin would be sitting in Kyiv if Donald Trump were president.
And understand what that means as — so much that our allies understand, and that's why they're concerned about this election. If — if Putin were to get away with invading the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine because America, the leader in bringing the allies together in standing for fundamental international rules and norms, like sovereignty and territorial integrity — if Vladimir Putin got away with that, you think he wouldn't march next right into Poland and the rest of Europe? Because Donald Trump wants to please somebody that he considers to be a strongman, who he admires?
So, on this and so many issues, the stakes are extremely high.
But I — I would say this as — as a final point for now. This is not as much an issue of what we are against as what we are for. And I'll end my point where I started: We love our country, and our country is worth fighting for. (Applause.) And that's how I think of this.
We — our — our democracy will only be as strong as our willingness to fight for it. And you all are taking your time out of your lives to be here because we, I think, agree on that among the most fundamental principles at stake.
And I thank you for the time you've taken, and I hope to earn your vote, by the way. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
MR. SYKES: And we have 15 days to make a decision.
Thank you all for coming here to (inaudible). Thank you, Congresswoman Liz Cheney. Vice President Kamala Harris, thank you so much. (Applause.)

    Vice President of the United States: 2021-2025
  
  

  
    Remarks by the Vice President at the Vice President's Residence
  


  

  
    October 23, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, yesterday, we learned that Donald Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, a retired four-star general, confirmed that while Donald Trump was president, he said he wanted generals like Adolf Hitler had.
Donald Trump said that because he does not want a military that is loyal to the United States Constitution. He wants a military that is loyal to him. He wants a military who will be loyal to him personally, one that will obey his orders even when he tells them to break the law or abandon their oath to the Constitution of the United States.
In just the past week, Donald Trump has repeatedly called his fellow Americans the ""enemy from within"" and even said that he would use the United States military to go after American citizens.
And let's be clear about who he considers to be the enemy from within. Anyone who refuses to bend a knee or dares to criticize him would qualify, in his mind, as the enemy within, like judges, like journalists, like nonpartisan election officials.
It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler, the man who is responsible for the deaths of 6 million Jews and hundreds of thousands of Americans.
All of this is further evidence for the American people of who Donald Trump really is. This is a window into who Donald Trump really is from the people who know him best, from the people who worked with him side by side in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room.
And it is clear from John Kelly's words that Donald Trump is someone who, I quote, ""certainly falls into the general definition of ""fascist,"" who, in fact, vowed to be a dictator on day one and vowed to use the military as his personal militia to carry out his personal and political vendettas.
Donald Trump is increasingly unhinged and unstable. And in a second term, people like John Kelly would not be there to be the guardrails against his propensities and his actions. Those who once tried to stop him from pursuing his worst impulses would no longer be there and no longer be there to rein him in.
So, the bottom line is this. We know what Donald Trump wants. He wants unchecked power. The question in 13 days will be: What do the American people want?

    Remarks by the Vice President at a CNN Town Hall in Chester Township, Pennsylvania
  


  

  
    October 23, 2024  

  
    MR. COOPER: Good evening. Only 13 days to go in one of the most momentous and unusual presidential races in American history.
Tonight, Kamala Harris faces voters in the biggest battleground prize: Pennsylvania. CNN Presidential Town Hall begins right now.
And welcome. We are live from Chester Township, Pennsylvania, Delaware County, one of the critical counties around Philadelphia that will help determine who wins the White House.
Welcome to CNN's Presidential Town Hall with the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. I'm Anderson Cooper.
Now, in this room, we have assembled a group of 32 Pennsylvania voters who say they are still undecided or persuadable. All of them are registered to vote. Some cast votes for Joe Biden in 2020, others for Donald Trump. Some didn't vote at all. And for some, this is their first election. Many are leaning right now to one candidate or another, but they all say they have yet to make their final choice.
Now we found these voters working with a nonpartisan research firm as well as business and religious groups, universities, and other civic organizations. These voters are asking their own questions tonight, selected by CNN to cover a variety of topics.
You may see them holding a piece of paper when they're asking their question. It has their question on it. That is a question they have come up with. It has not been edited in any way by CNN.
We also invited former President Donald Trump to participate in a town hall or a debate. He declined.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Vice President Kamala Harris. (Applause.)
(The Vice President enters the stage.)
Madam Vice President, thank you. Appreciate it. Thanks. You have a mic right here.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
MR. COOPER: Thank you so much —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good evening, everyone. Good evening.
MR. COOPER: Thank you so much for being with us. We're going to get to the audience in just a second.
I want to start by asking you, though — for weeks, you have been calling Donald Trump ""unstable,"" ""unhinged."" You've called him ""dangerous."" You quoted General Milley recently, who called him a ""fascist.""
Today, you quoted General Kelly, who said that Trump repeatedly praised Hitler.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MR. COOPER: But there are tens of millions of Americans right now who have heard all those things, and they don't buy it or, even if they do, they're still going to vote for Donald Trump.
He's arguably more popular now than ever. You have 13 days to go. What do you say to those voters to convince them? Because some of them are in this room.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Sure, and I — I thank you all for taking the time to be here. And you could be doing a number of other things with your time, so this really is proof that we love our country. People are engaged, Anderson, and really want to talk about the issues.
And so, the issue that you raise — yes, I do believe that Donald Trump is unstable — increasingly unstable and unfit to serve.
And I don't necessarily think that everyone has heard what you and I have heard repeatedly, which is the people who know Donald Trump best, the people who worked with him in the White House, in the Situation Room, in the Oval Office — all Republicans, by the way, who served in his administration — his former chief of staff, his national security advisor, former secretaries of Defense, and his vice president have all called him unfit and dangerous.
They have said, explicitly, he has contempt for the Constitution of the United States. They have said he should never again serve as president of the United States. We know that is why Mike Pence is not running with him again, why the job was empty.
And then, today, we learned that John Kelly, a four-star Marine general, who was his longest-serving chief of staff, gave an interview recently, in the last two weeks of this election, talking about how dangerous Donald Trump is.
And I think one has to think about: Why would someone who served with him, who is not political — a four-star Marine general — why is he telling the American people now? And frankly, I think of it as — as he's just putting out a 911 call to the American people.
Understand what could happen if Donald Trump were back in the White House. And this time, we must take very seriously those folks who knew him best and who were career people are not going to be there to hold him back. At least, before, there were folks who — we know what he would say, but they would restrain him.
Imagine now Donald Trump in the Oval Office, in the Situation Room — he who has openly admired dictators, said he would be a dictator on day one. The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has said he is a ""fascist to the core.""
So, I think that when the American people reflect, especially those who are undecided, on who you should listen to, don't take my word for it. In fact, go online and listen to John Kelly — his voice — talking about what he thinks of Donald Trump two weeks before the election.
Because I think we all know — to your point, Anderson — it is close, but there are undecided voters who clearly, by being here, have an open mind, want to talk in a way that is abou- — grounded in issues and fact.
And when they hear these facts, I think it compels a lot of people to be concerned about the future of our country with Donald Trump at the lead.
You've quoted General Milley calling Donald Trump a ""fascist."" You yourself have not used that word to describe him.
Let me ask you tonight: Do you think Donald Trump is a fascist?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes, I do. Yes, I do.
And I — and I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted. Again, look at their careers. These are not people — with the exception, I think, of only Mike Pence, these were not politicians.
These are career people who have served in — in the highest roles in national security, who have served as generals in our military, who are highly respected, talking about the person who would be commander in chief, not to mention what we know and what they've told us about he talks — how he talks about the military, servicemen and women, referring to them as ""suckers"" and ""losers."" How he — he demeans people who have taken an oath to sacrifice their life for our country.
And I do believe, Anderson, that part of this is why, even just this week, I traveled this state and others with Liz Cheney, former congressmember who was very a high-ranking Republican. She has endorsed me. Her father, the former vice president of the United States, Dick Cheney, is voting for me. Over 400 members of — previous members of the administration — from Ronald Reagan to both Presidents Bush to Donald Trump — even have endorsed my candidacy.
And the reason why, among them, is a legitimate fear, based on Donald Trump's words and actions, that he will not obey an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. He himself has said he would terminate the Constitution of the United States and wants to earn your vote to stand again behind the seal of the president of the United States.
No one standing behind the seal of the president of the United States of America should be in that position saying they want to terminate the Constitution of the United States.
MR. COOPER: Let's get to some of our voters.
This is a — I want you to meet a registered Republican who's very concerned about Trump's views on democracy and January 6th. She told us she's looking for a reason to vote for you, but is yet to make her final decision.
Her name is Natasha Kwiatkowski. She's a student at Bryn Mawr College.
What's your question, Natasha?
Q: Awesome. Thank you for being here and thank you for taking my question.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Natasha.
Q: And as someone who hasn't fully committed to either party, how do you plan to address the concerns of independent voters and anti-Trump Republicans like myself who feel left out of the polarized political landscape? And what specific actions would you take to bridge the political divide and create more unity?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's a wonderful question. I pledge to you to be a president for all Americans. And I think, to the point and the spirit of your question, that people are frankly exhausted with what has been happening over the last several years, which is this environment that is suggesting that Americans should be pointing fingers at one another, that we are divided as a nation, instead of what I think you and I — I will speak for us, I think — who believe and know the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.
And I think that the American people deserve to have a president who is grounded in what is common sense, what is practical, and what is in the best interest of the people, not themselves.
I started my career as a prosecutor. And I will tell you, I never in my career — and most of my career was outside of Washington, D.C., by the way. Only four years, when I was in the Senate, were in Washington, other than being vice president.
I have never, in my career as a prosecutor, asked a victim or a witness of a crime, ""Are you a Democrat or Republican?"" The only thing I have ever asked is ""Are you okay?""
And I do believe that is what the American people deserve in their president and not someone who makes decisions based on who voted for them or what is in their personal interest.
And I reference that because, as we know, it has been revealed that Donald Trump, when he was president, during extreme disasters, when it came time to determine how those areas — those people who had been traumatized by extreme weather would get relief, he asked the question: Did they vote for him?
I believe the American people deserve better, and they deserve a president who is focused on solutions, not sitting in the Oval Office plotting their revenge and retribution.
MR. COOPER: Let me introduce you to Erik Svendsen. He runs a service desk for an IT company in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. He's registered as a libertarian, describes himself as an independent. He says he's undecided.
Erik.
Q: Thank you, Anderson. Thank you both for being here.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Erik.
Q: So, my question is concerning groceries.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
Q: Grocery prices have gone up quite a bit in the last four years, and some people blame former President Trump. Some people blame President Biden. Who would you say is correct? And what would you do to bring prices down for Americans?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Erik. And you're absolutely right. You know it. I know it. I think most Americans know it. The price of groceries is still too high, and we need to address it in a number of ways.
One of my aspects of doing what we need to do to bring down the cost of living for working people and the middle class in America is to address the issue of grocery prices.
Part of my background and how I come to it is probably a new approach, grounded in a lot of my experiences as a former attorney general, where I took on price gouging. And part of my plan is to create a new approach that is the first time that we will have a national ban on price gouging, which is companies taking advantage of the desperation and need of the American consumer and jacking up prices without any consequence or accountability.
So, that is one way. But to your point, Erik, there — you know, there are a number of issues that we need to address in terms of bringing down the cost of living. It includes what we need as a — really, a new approach that I bring to the — the issue of affordable housing, including, for example, rent.
And again, I bring to it my experience, knowing what has been happening in terms of how corporations have been buying up blocks of property to diminish competition, and then rents get jacked up, and addressing that both in terms of making sure that there is a consequence and accountability for that but also investing in people's dreams of homeownership, you know, knowing that for too long, frankly, both administrations — I mean both administrations and both parties, Democrats and Republicans — haven't done enough to deal with the issue of housing.
And we need a new approach that includes working with the private sector — I say that as a — as a devout public servant — working with the private sector to cut through the red tape, working with homebuilders, working with developers to create tax incentives so that we can create more housing supply and bring down the price.
MR. COOPER: Let me just ask you about price gouging. I looked at your plan. You talked about going after price gougers — and I'm quoting from the plan — ""on essential goods during emergencies or times of crisis.""
I get that. How does that help, though, someone like Erik with prices that, for years, the groceries prices have just been high?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, Anderson, as you know — and obviously CNN has been covering extensively what has been happening in the state of Georgia, North Carolina, Florida — it's a real issue.
I — I was attorney general of California. I was the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state in the country. I took this issue on because it affects a lot of people. And I'm not going to apologize for the fact that we need to actually deal with accountability when these — not all — in fact, most don't — but when companies are taking advantage of the desperation and the need of the American people.
We saw it actually during the pandemic as well, where, because of supply chain issues, we — there was a reduction of supply and then they would inflate the price of everyday necessities — not to mention, by the way, again, Donald Trump should be here tonight to talk with you and answer your questions. He's not. He refused to come.
But understand that part of his plan is to put in place a national sales tax of at least 20 percent on everyday goods and necessities. And that, by economists' estimates — independent economists — would cost you, as the American consumer and taxpayer, an additional $4,000 a year.
MR. COOPER: I want you to meet Carol Nackenoff, a political science professor at Swarthmore College. She's a registered Democrat who says she's leaning toward voting for you, has yet to make her final decision.
Carol.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi, Carol. Thank you.
Q: Good evening.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good evening.
Q: Thank you for visiting us in Delaware County —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Of course.
Q: — Vice President Harris.
My question is this. If you could accomplish only one major policy goal that required congressional action, what would it be and why?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, there's not just one. I have to be honest with you, Carol. There's a lot of work that needs to happen.
But let's — let's — I think that maybe part of this point that I — how I think about it is we've got to get past this era of politics and partisan politics slowing down what we need to do in terms of progress in our country. And that means working across the aisle.
I've done that before. We did it around — whether it be what we were able to accomplish with the bipartisan infrastructure deal or some of the work that we have done in terms of dealing with gun safety.
But we've got to work across the aisle, and it is my commitment to work with Democrats, with Republicans, with independents to deal with a number of issues, whether it be what we need to do in terms of housing and creating legislation that creates incentives for that; what we need to do to reinstate the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do; whether it be what we need to do to actually invest in a substantial way in the industries of the future, in American-based manufacturing, in American-based industries where American workers and union workers have those jobs in a way that is good-paying jobs that gives people the dignity they deserve.
All of those areas, I plan on working across the aisle and with Congress, including the issue of immigration, which we've got to fix.
MR. COOPER: Let me ask you. You've talked about codifying Roe v. Wade. That would obviously require 60 votes in — in the Senate, a majority of the House. That's a big — that's a big leap. You don't — we don't have that yet. If that's not possible, to codify it in the House, what do you do?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I think we need to take a look at the filibuster, to be honest with you.
But the — the reality of it is this. Let's talk about how we got here. When Donald Trump was president, he hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended. And now, in 20 states, we have Trump abortion bans that include punishing health care providers, doctors, and nurses.
In Texas, you know, they provide for prison for life for a health care provider for doing the job that they believe is in the best interest of their patient.
J- — laws — Trump abortion bans, some that make no exception even for rape or incest.
One of the areas I special in as a pro- — specialized in as a prosecutor was crimes against women and children. The idea you would tell a survivor of a violation to their body that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next? This is what's happening in our country.
You all may have heard the stories. Women have died. Women have died because of these laws.
And the suffering — I have to say, Anderson, traveling — for example, again, I was with Liz Cheney this week. She is unapologetically pro-life and will also tell you that she doesn't agree with what's been happening.
I find that many people I've met who are pro-life have said to me, ""You know, I didn't intend that this would happen. I would — I didn't intend that women who are suffering a miscarriage would develop sepsis,"" as has happened many times. ""I didn't intend that women would die. I didn't intend that there would now be restrictions on access to in vitro fertilization. I didn't intend that there would be an effort to limit access to contraception.""
So, you know, this is probably one of the most fundamental freedoms that we as Americans could imagine, which is the freedom to literally make decisions about your own body.
And on some issues, I think we've got to agree that partisanship should be put aside. And I'll close with this point: I know it is possible because when you look at the midterms, in so-called red states and so-called blue states, when this issue of freedom was on the ballot, the American people voted for freedom.
MR. COOPER: This is Leanne Griffiths. She's registered with no party affiliation. She's a student at the University of Pennsylvania. She says she's leaning towards supporting you, has yet to make up a final decision because she isn't sure who's better for the economy.
Leanne.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
Q: Hi, Vice President. Thank you for being here today.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Of course.
Q: Considering you have been in the position of vice president for the past four years under the Biden administration, how can we expect you to deviate from the direction of that administration compared to your own? How can we differentiate your policy and your beliefs from that of Biden's?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's a great question. And thank you.
Well, first of all, my administration will not be a continuation of the Biden administration. I bring to this role my own ideas and my own experience. I represent a new generation of leadership on a number of issues and believe that we have to actually take new approaches.
For example, what we talked about in terms of housing, I — my experience that leads to that priority includes what I did to take on the big banks around the foreclosure crisis when I brought billions of dollars to homeowners that were the subject of predatory lending.
I know what homeownership means to the American people, not to mention what it meant to my mother, who worked very hard and saved up so that by the time I was a teenager, she was able to buy our first home.
I bring to it my experience actually taking care of my mother when she was sick, and it was — as it turned out, dying from cancer. And so, I know what it means and have the experience of taking care of an elderly relative, and I have raised children.
And so, I bring, too, my priorities and will, as president, a new approach and a new idea, frankly, about what we need to do to deal with the sandwich generation, which is what we call those folks who are literally in the middle, who are raising their young children and taking care of their parents, which is why my plan and approach says, ""Hey, you shouldn't have to — to wipe out all your savings to qualify for Medicaid to be able to get support, to hire somebody to help you cook for your parent or help them put on a sweater."" I've done that. I know what that requires.
You shouldn't have to quit your job in order to do the work that is necessary to take care of your children and your parent, because it's overwhelming to try to do it all. And so, my plan is to have and allow Medicare to cover the cost of home health care for our seniors.
These are a couple of examples, including what we talked about in terms of price gouging and what we need to do in addition — and it's a new approach that I think is well overdue — let's invest in the small businesses of America.
I — I — the woman who helped raise us was a small-business owner. I know who small-business owners are. I know what they do. They are the backbone of America's economy, and for too long, we've overlooked their value to the economy as a whole, much less to the economy of neighborhoods and communities.
So, that's why my plan — and it's a new approach — is about tax cuts for our small businesses so that they can invest in themselves and grow and, in the process, invest in communities, invest in neighborhoods, and strengthen our economy overall.
So, those are some examples. It's about a new approach, a new generation of leadership based on new ideas and, frankly, different experiences.
I bring a whole set of different experiences to this job and the way I think about it —
MR. COOPER: Some — some —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — than — than Joe Biden.
MR. COOPER: Some voters, though, might ask: You've been in the White House for — for four years. You were vice president, not the president, but why wasn't any of that done over the last four years?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, there was a lot that was done, but there's more to do, Anderson. And — and I am pointing out things that need to be done that haven't been done but need to be done. And I'm not going to shy away from saying, ""Hey, these are still problems that we need to fix.""
MR. COOPER: I want you to meet Jaxon Weiss. He's a student at Drexel University from Flourtown, Pennsylvania; registered Republican, says he's leaning toward voting for you, but has yet to make up a final decision.
Jaxon.
Q: Thank you, Anderson.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi, Jaxon.
Q: Thank you for taking the time to be here, too, Vice President Harris.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You too. Thank you.
Q: Regarding the rapid increase in the migrant population, how will you ensure that every immigrant is integrated into American society safely? What benefits and subsidies will you provide them with? And how long will these benefits and subsidies last for an individual? Most importantly, will the American citizens' taxes pay for these benefits and subsidies? And if so, how much mon- — how much money will be allocated?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Jaxon. Let's start with this. America's immigration system is broken, and it needs to be fixed, and it's been broken for a long time. And part of what we need to do is always prioritize what we need to do to strengthen our border.
I will tell you, I'm the only person in this race, among the two choices that voters have — I have personally prosecuted transnational criminal organizations in the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings. I have spent a significant part of my career making sure that our border is secure and that we do not allow criminals in and we don't allow that kind of trafficking to happen and come into our country.
And as the — as my opponent has proven himself, he would prefer to run on the problem instead of fix the problem. You may know, there were some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress, working with others, that came up with a border security bill that would have put 1,500 more border agents at the border. Those boarder agents are overwhelmed. They need the support. They need the backup.
It would have allowed us to have more resources to stem the flow of fentanyl. I don't need to tell this state and people around the country what is happening in terms of the scourge of fentanyl and how it is literally killing Americans.
It would have put resources into stemming the flow. It would have given more resources to prosecute — to investigate and prosecute transnational criminal organizations. It would have done a lot of good.
Donald Trump got wind of the bill and told them, ""Don't put it forward."" He killed the bill because he'd prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.
We have to have a secure border, and we have to have a comprehensive pathway for citizenship.
MR. COOPER: Le- — let me —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And that includes requiring people — hardworking people to earn citizenship and do it in a comprehensive, humane, and orderly manner.
MR. COOPER: Let me ask you about that. I mean, you talk about the bill that Donald Trump quashed. That was in 2024. You talk about the bill he tried to get passed in 2021. That wasn't able to get passed. 2022, 2023 —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Sure.
MR. COOPER: — there were record border crossings. You — your administration took a number — hundreds of executive actions. It didn't stem the flow. Numbers kept going up.
Finally, in 2024, just in June, three weeks before the la- — the first presidential debate with Joe Biden, you institute executive actions that had a dramatic impact, really shut down people crossing over. Why didn't your administration do that in 2022, 2023?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: First of all, you're exactly right, Anderson. And as of today, we have cut the flow of immigration by over half. In fact, the numbers I saw most recently, illegal immigration is low- —
MR. COOPER: But if it was that easy —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But hold on. Let me finish. Let me —
MR. COOPER: — with that executive action, why not do it in —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well —
MR. COOPER: — 2022, 2023?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — because we were working with Congress and hoping that, actually, we could have a long-term fix to the problem instead of a short-term fix.
MR. COOPER: You couldn't have done one and the — both at the same time?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, here's the thing. We have to understand that ultimately this problem is going to be fixed through congressional action. Congress has the authority and the purse — I — I hate to use D.C. terms, but, literally, they write the checks.
Part of the issue is in order to really fix the problem at the border — I was just at the border recently talking with border agents. You know what they talk about? Yes, they are overwhelmed. They're working around the clock. And the other thing that they talk to me about: We need more judges down there to deal with asylum claims. We need more personnel down there to deal with processing.
A- — but, Anderson — and that's where Congress kicks in, in terms of dedicating the resources to actually fixing the problem.
We have dealt with it such that, to your point, we now, as of today, as of our — our visit, have lower undocumented immigrants and illegal immigration than Trump when he left office.
MR. COOPER: That — that's true —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But we need a permanent solution, and that requires —
MR. COOPER: Do you wish you had done that —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — bipartisan work.
MR. COOPER: Do you wish you had done those executive orders in 2022, 2023?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I think we did the right thing, and — but the best thing that can happen for the American people is that we have bipartisan work happening. And I pledge to you that I will work across the aisle to fix this long-standing problem.
I think the American people are demanding it —
MR. COOPER: Yeah.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — on both sides of the aisle, and it's time we actually put the partisan approach to this aside. We know what can work.
MR. COOPER: Well, let's talk about this compromise bill you — that you want to pass if you are elected. You said that's going to be a priority. It includes $650 million in funding for the border wall. That's something Republicans wanted. That was part of the compromise.
Under Donald Trump, you criticized the wall more than 50 times. You called it ""stupid,"" ""useless,"" and a ""medieval vanity project."" Is a border wall stupid?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, let's talk about Donald Trump and that border wall. (Laughs.) So, remember Donald Trump said Mexico would pay for it? Come on. They didn't. How much of that wall did he build? I think the last number I saw was about 2 percent. And then, when it came time for him to do a photo op, you know where he did it? In the part of the wall that President Obama built.
MR. COOPER: But you're agreeing —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, come on. (Laughs.)
MR. COOPER: — to a bill that would earmark $650 million to continue building that wall.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We — I — I pledge that I'm going to bring forward that bipartisan bill to further strengthen and secure our border. Yes, I am.
MR. COOPER: But —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I'm going to work across the aisle to pass com- — a comprehensive bill that deals with a broken immigration system.
I think Jaxon's question, part of it, was to acknowledge that America has always had migration, but there needs to be a legal process for it. People have to earn it.
MR. COOPER: Right.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And that's the point that, I think, is the most important point that can be made, which is we need a president who is grounded in common sense and practical outcomes. Like, let's just fix this thing. Let's just fix it. Why is there any ideological perspective on — let's just fix the problem.
MR. COOPER: To fix the problem, you're — you're doing this compromise bill. It does call for $650 million that was earmarked under Trump to actually still go to build the wall.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I am not afraid of good ideas where the occur, Anderson.
MR. COOPER: You do- — so, you don't think it's ""stupid"" anymore?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I think what he did and how he did it did — was — did not make much sense, because he actually didn't do much of anything. I just t- — talked about that wall, right? (Laughs.) We just talked about it. He didn't actually do much of anything.
MR. COOPER: But you do want to build some wall?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I want to strengthen our border.
MR. COOPER: This is Annalise Kean. She's from Philadelphia. She works as a fundraiser for Habitat for Humanity. She's registered with no party affiliation. She says she's a Democrat. She's leaning toward voting for you but said she's yet to make her final decision, in part because of the conflict in the Middle East.
Annalise.
Q: Thank you. And good evening, Madam Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good evening.
Q: My question is, as president, what would you do to ensure not another Palestinian dies due to bombs being funded by U.S. tax dollars?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, I will say — and I think this is to your point — far too many innocent Palestinian civilians have been killed. It's unconscionable. And we are now at a place where, with Sinwar's death, I do believe we have an opportunity to end this war, bring the hostages home, bring relief to the Palestinian people, and work toward a two-state solution where Israel and the Palestinians in equal measure have security, where the Palestinian people have dignity, self-determination, and the safety they — that they so rightly deserve.
MR. COOPER: What — what do you say to voters who are thinking about supporting a third-party candidate or staying on the couch, not voting at all because of this issue?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Listen, I am not going to deny the strong feelings that people have. I don't know that anyone who has seen the images who would not have strong feelings about what has happened, much less those who have relatives who have died and been killed. And I — and I know people and have talked with people, so I appreciate that.
But I also do know that, for many people who care about this issue, they also care about bringing down the price of groceries. They also care about our democracy and not having a president of the United States who admires dictators and is a fascist.
They also care about the fact that we need practical, commonsense solutions from a leader who is willing to work across the aisle on behalf of the American people and not themselves.
P- — they want a president who cares about a fundamental freedom to make decisions about your own body, understanding that we're not trying to change anyone's belief, but let's not have the government telling women what to do with their body.
MR. COOPER: I want you to meet Beth Samberg. She's a realtor, a mom of four from Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. She's a registered Democrat. Says she's undecided because of concerns about antisemitism.
Beth.
Q: Hi. Thank you for being here.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Beth.
Q: Thank you for remembering we need to bring the hostages home.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Of course.
Q: The rise of antisemitism and violence from — the rise of antisemitism and violence from antisemitism has risen greatly on college campuses and on our city streets in the last year. How would you combat this growing trend and protect our young adults?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Beth. You are right, and I will say that we have seen a rise in antisemitism. It is something that we have to be honest about and we have to deal with.
As attorney general, I actually published a hate crimes report on a regular basis, and antisemitism was among the highest forms of hate in our country. And this was before October 7, and we know what we've seen since.
Part of what we've got to do is talk with people so that they understand what are the tropes, what are the — the roots of — of what we are seeing so that we can actually have people be more understanding.
We need to have laws in place that make those who would commit crimes on behalf of antisemitism and hate — that they pay a serious consequence.
We need to have the deterrent so that doesn't happen. We need to ensure that college students are safe in their school and feel safe to be able to go to class.
But I'm going to tell you what doesn't help. Again, I invite you to listen and — go online to listen to John Kelly, the former chief of staff of Donald Trump, who has told us Donald Trump said, ""Why"" — essentially, ""Why aren't my generals like those of Hitler's?"" Like Hitler. Who has referred several times — we've heard the reports for years.
MR. COOPER: Do you believe Donald Trump is antisemitic?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I believe Donald Trump is a danger to the well-being and security of America.
MR. COOPER: He has said that he — he's casting himself as a protector of Israel. Do you believe you would be more pro-Israel than Donald Trump?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I believe that Donald Trump is dangerous. I believe that when you have a president of the United States who has said to his generals who work for him, because he is commander in chief — these conversations, I assume, many of them took place in the Oval Office — and if the president of the United States, the commander in chief, is saying to his generals, in essence, ""Why can't you be more like Hitler's generals"" — Anderson, come on. This is a serious, serious issue.
And we know who he is. He admires dictators, sending love letters back and forth with Kim Jong Un; talks about the president of Russia. And then, most recently, the reports are that in the height of COVID, when most Americans could not get their hands on a COVID test — Americans were dying by the hundreds a day — he secretly sent COVID tests to the president of Russia for his personal use.
So, again, there — thi- — this election in 13 days is presenting the American people with a very significant decision. And on the one side, on this issue of who is going to model what it means to use the bully pulpit of the president of the United States in a manner that in tone, word, and deed is about lifting up our discourse, fighting against hate, as opposed to fanning the flames of hate, which Donald Trump does consistently — I — I'm going to tell you, we are an incredible country, and we love our country. You all wouldn't be here unless we love our country. And there are certain things where we've just got to come together and realize that — that we do believe in the importance of healthy debate on real issues, but there are certain standards we've got to have.
And, you know, another point that even John Kelly talked about, I — I believe, and many have, is January 6th, where you have the president of the United States defying the will of the people in a free and fair election and unleashing a violent mob who attacked the United States Capitol. A hundred and forty law enforcement officers were attacked; some were killed.
And so, I say that to say: The American people deserve to have a president who encourages healthy debate; works across the aisle; not afraid of good ideas, wherever they come from; but also maintains certain standards about how we think about the role and the responsibility; and certainly not comparing oneself, in a clearly admiring way, to Hitler.
MR. COOPER: We're going to take a — a quick break. We'll have more from the CNN Presidential Town Hall with Vice President Kamala Harris.
(Commercial break.)
And we are back with Vice President Kamala Harris.
I want to ask you about something I read. I read that the fir- — one of the first phone calls you made after President Biden announced that he was dropping out was to your pastor.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes.
MR. COOPER: And I'm wondering, if it wasn't a confessional, if you could say what that conversation was like.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, my pastor, Reverend Dr. Amos C. Brown of Third Baptist Church —
It was — it was an extraordinary day, that Sunday, when the president called me. And I — I instinctively understood the gravity of the moment, the seriousness of the moment. I didn't predict or know exactly how that day would play out. And obviously, now it's been three months since I've been at the top of the ticket — actually, three months as of yesterday.
But I just called him. I — I needed that spiritual kind of connection. I needed that advice. I needed a prayer. And — and there's a — there's a part of the scripture that talks about Esther and ""a time such as this."" And — and that's what we talked about, and it was very comforting for me. And — and —
MR. COOPER: Do you pray every day?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I do pray every day. I do pray every day, sometimes twice a day.
I — you know, my — I grew up — so, we grew up — a little neighborhood church in Oakland, 23rd Avenue Church of God. And I was raised to believe in a loving God, to believe that your faith is a verb, you know? You — you live your faith, and — and that — that the way that one should do that is that your work and your life's work should be to think about how you can serve in a way that is uplifting other people, that is about caring for other people. And that guides a lot of how I think about my work and — and what is important.
MR. COOPER: Let's go to the voters. I want you to meet Joe Donahue from Bucks County, Pennsylvania.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi, Joe.
MR. COOPER: He works in customer service for a local retailer. He serves as a local election official. He's a registered Republican who says he's undecided, doesn't agree with your stance on abortion, but he is concerned about what he calls Trump's demeanor and actions on January 6th.
Joe.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi, Joe.
Q: Thank you, Madam Vice President. And thank you, Anderson.
Madam Vice President, everybody — as human beings, we are not perfect. We have our flaws. We make mistakes. We have our weaknesses. And the office of the presidency can sometimes bring those weaknesses out in ways that the incumbent may not expect.
What weaknesses do you bring to the table, and how do you plan to overcome them while you're in office?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's a great question, Joe. Well, I am certainly not perfect — (laughs) — so let's start there.
And I think that — I — perhaps a weakness, some would say, but I actually think it's a strength, is I really do value having a team of very smart people around me who bring to my de- — decision-making process different perspectives. I — my team will tell you, I am constantly saying, ""Let's hi- — kick the tire on that. Let's kick the tires on it.""
Because, I — listen, I — as I mentioned earlier, I started my career as a prosecutor. I was a courtroom prosecutor. I've tried everything from low-level offenses to homicides, and I learned at a very early stage of my career and adult life that my actions have a direct impact on real people in a very fundamental way.
When I was attorney general of California, I was attorney general of the — what is the fifth largest economy in the world and acutely aware that my words could move markets.
So, I take my role and responsibility as an elected leader very seriously, and I know the impact it has on so many people I may never meet. And that is why I engage and bring folks around.
So, I may not be quick to have the answer as soon as you ask it about a specific policy issue sometimes, because I'm going to want to research it. I'm going to want to study it. I'm kind of a nerd sometimes — (laughs) — I confess. And some might call that a weakness, especially if you're, you know, in an interview or just kind of, you know —
MR. COOPER: L- — let me a- —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — being asked a certain question, and you're expected to have the right answer right away. But that's how I — that's how I work.
MR. COOPER: I- — you — we — I don't think I've ever heard the former president admit a mistake. A lot of politicians don't. Is there something you can point to in your life, political life or in your life in the last four years, that you think is a mistake that you have learned from?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I mean, I — I've made many mistakes, and they range from — you know, if you've ever parented a child, you know you make lots of mistakes too. (Laughs.)
In my role as vice president, I mean, I've probably worked very hard at making sure that I am well-versed on issues, and I think that is very important. It's a mistake not to be well-versed on an issue and feel compelled to answer a question.
MR. COOPER. I want you to meet Pam Thistle. She's from Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania. She's a realtor. She's a widow. Her husband, Mike, died just a year ago.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Oh, I'm sorry.
MR. COOPER: She has two daughters in college. She registered with no party affiliation and says she's undecided. She has concerns about how you would handle the economy.
Pam.
Q: Thank you. And thank you, Anderson. And happy belated birthday too.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you very much.
Q: I really —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I'm sorry for your loss. I'm sorry.
Q: Oh, thank you. Yes. And I'm really appreciative for you to be here and get to know you.
When you talk about rich people paying their fair share, can you be more specific? Income taxes are already on a graduated scale, where the more you make, the higher percentage you pay in taxes. So, the rich are paying a disproportionate amount in taxes as it is. Over 40 percent of Americans don't pay any income taxes. Also, the really high earners may move their money offshore if there are disinte- — disincentives in the U.S. This could impact the economy.
I would like to hear more nuts and bolts about your economic plans.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Sure. Thank you, Pam.
So, first of all, it is the case in the United States of America that billionaires, on average, pay less taxes as a percentage —
Q: Yeah.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — than teachers and firefighters and nurses.
Q: Yeah.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And that —
Q: I'm talking about hard workers like — like pound the street, have some success.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I'm — yes. No, no, no, I understand.
Q: Yes.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But I want to just — let's set the — let —
Q: Not the really high.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Let's set the scene, right?
Q: Yeah.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, when I say that the — the richest among us need to pay their fair share —
Q: Okay.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — I am referencing that, and I — I need to reference that because, sadly, Donald Trump, when he was president, gave tax cuts to the richest, to billionaires and big corporations, which added trillions of dollars to our deficit. So, that, sadly, needs to be said in a way that should be obvious, to your point, but is not, given what he did.
Now, in terms of what we need to do to bring down taxes, I have pledged and have a plan for a middle-class tax cut that would affect 100 million Americans, including, for example, what we will do around small businesses in terms of tax deductions, in terms of what small businesses are now being mired in, in terms of a bureaucracy around they have to fill out and do their taxes in a way that actually holds them back.
Part of my plan includes extending a middle-class tax cut that would include a $6,000 tax cut, essentially a child tax credit, for parents — and young parents, in particular — knowing that the vast majority of our parents have a natural desire to parent their children well but not always the resources. So, this is going to include an extra amount of, just, money that people can use to pay for childcare, which is far too expensive for too many working pa- — families.
And part of the issue here is this. We cannot, and I will not, raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year.
MR. COOPER: Yeah.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But we do need to take seriously the system that benefits the richest and does not help out working, middle-class Americans.
I come from the middle class, and I believe that the middle class needs tax breaks to be able to actually not just get by but get ahead.
MR. COOPER: So, you're saying — what — what you're saying is anyone under $400,000 won't have taxes raised. Are you saying that anyone above $400,000 will have a tax raise?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I'm saying that there is going to be a parity around what the richest people pay in terms of their taxes. Right now, Anderson, you know the document — the — it is well-documented that some of the richest people in our country have gotten away with a zero-tax rate.
MR. COOPER: But if you earning $500-, $600-, $700,000, under your plan, there's a good chance your taxes will go up?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I- — this — we can't have this conversation without knowing what thi- — it's a very complicated situation, right? If you're talking about a small-business owner, I'm going to bring down — cut taxes for small businesses — right? — because I know that they need the overhead — the money that they need for overhead to actually benefit the growth of their business, which benefits our economy as a whole.
MR. COOPER: Let's go to — actually, you know, I want to reference something that — that — about Pam. Pam, w- — mentioned her husband, Steve, died a year ago. You — you've talked about your mom, Shyamala Harris, who died 15 years ago. What has grief been like for you? Do you still grieve?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah, you don't stop grieving. You don't stop grieving.
I mean, the — I — I think that there is — you know, there are, like, two sides to a coin when you have lost somebody you love. And — or that two sides to a coin, that phrase becomes evident, which is, if you have had the blessing of a close and — and important relationship with someone, then when you ha- — that the other side of the coin is that when you lose them, the grief becomes even deeper.
But I also believe that, for example, anyone who has lost a family member through cancer or an illness — my mother died from cancer. It is important to try and remember them as they lived and not as they died, because the grief can really weigh you down.
I think the brain has a way of, when you're grieving, really spiraling down, and it's important, I think, to try and remember those you have lost in a way they'd want to be remembered, as being vibrant.
And — and I think it's important to just — to — to grieve as one does. I don't think there's any correct or proper way to grieve. And the most important thing is, I think, that people do not suppress what they're feeling at any moment, and the rest of us should give them grace to — to go through it as — as they will.
MR. COOPER: We're going to take a — a short break. We'll be right back with more from the CNN Presidential Town Hall with Vice President Kamala Harris.
(Commercial break.)
And we are back with Vice President Kamala Harris. I want you to meet Rob MacPherson. He's the chief marketing officer for a local organization. He's registered Republican, from Media, Pennsylvania, who told us he's leaning towards voting for you but has concerns about what he calls ""shifts"" in your policy positions.
Rob.
Q: Thank you. Thank you for being here, Vice President Harris. So, welcome to Delco.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Laughter.) Thank you.
Q: Here in Delco, we — we pride ourselves on being authentic —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
Q: — and much of what we have se- — been say- — have seen much of what you've been saying with regard to issues like law and order and fracking reflect a more centrist view than what people are used to hearing from Kamala Harris, leaving some voters to wonder about the authenticity of your current more moderate positions. Can you talk a little bit about how your positions have shifted and why?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Sure. And thank you.
So, first of all, on fracking. I've been very clear. We kind of dispensed with this in 2020. I am not going to ban fracking. I did not as vice president. In fact, as vice president, I cast the tiebreaking vote that now has opened up more fracking leases.
My value on the issue of what we need to do to invest in a clean energy economy and a clean energy future has not changed. But frankly, I now have the experience and perspective of having been vice president for almost four years. I've traveled the country. I know that we can invest in a clean energy economy and still not ban fracking and still work toward what we need to do to create more jobs and create U.S.-based jobs in a way that will be globally competitive.
On the issue of law and order, as you mentioned, I think there's just a whole lot of misinformation, to be honest with you. I have personally prosecuted very serious crime. It's how I started my career. I spent most of my career as a prosecutor, not in Washington, D.C.
And as my first priority had — and — and remains as a first priority to me — the safety of the American people. So, that has not changed. And sadly, I think that there is a bit of misinformation, if not more than a bit, but I'm glad that you raised the subject so that I can address it.
MR. COOPER: You — but — but —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But I — but — but — just if you don't mind —
MR. COOPER: Sure.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — just let me just finish — I — because I think the — the spirit of your question is really important, and I'm glad you raised it.
Our country deserves to have a president of the United States who is not afraid of good ideas and does not stand on pride if a perspective needs to be informed by different points of view to build consensus and to have a commonsense approach.
I'm never going to shy away from good ideas, and I'm not going to feel the need to have pride associated with a position that I've taken when the important thing is to build consensus to fix problems. I believe in fixing problems. I love fixing problems.
And so, I pledge to you to be a president who not only works for all Americans but works on getting stuff done. And that means compromise. And it doesn't mean compromising your values or your principles, but it does mean working to get stuff done.
MR. COOPER: But —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I pledge to you I will do that.
MR. COOPER: Just to be clear, though, what he's referring to — and you point out, too, when you were running for vice president in 2020, you were not talking about banning fracking. But —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: No, no. No, Anderson, I — I pledged that I would not ban fracking.
MR. COOPER: Right, I know. You said —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MR. COOPER: — you would not ban fracking.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Correct.
MR. COOPER: You know, you had said in a 2019 town hall, ""There's no question, I'm in favor of banning fracking."" In 2017, you talked about Medicare for All. You talked about — in 2019, you raised a hand in a debate about if bor- — border crossings should be decriminalized.
Are all of those issues — which those are not your positions now — are all those issues that you're saying, through consensus and getting stuff done, you have evolved on?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, no, let's take, for example, the issue of Medicare. My point has always been that access to health care should not just be a privilege of those who can afford it. It should be a right for all people.
So, that is why I have worked on doing what we have done to, one, allow Medicare to negotiate against the big pharmaceutical companies to bring down the cost of prescription medication. We've a- — we've achieved that in terms of capping the cost of insulin for seniors at $35 a month, capping the cost of — of annual prescriptions at $2,000 a year for seniors.
But my plan moving forward, based on that very principle that I've always had, is, as president, to have that cap be for everyone and not just for our seniors.
The work that I have done that has been about recognizing the importance of dealing with border security — that has never changed. As I said, I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations. That I did for years before I ever ran in 2019.
MR. COOPER: I mean, you did raise your hand saying in a debate when asked if border crossing should be decriminalized. But obviously, that is not your — your position.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I — I never intended, nor do I — will I ever allow America to have a border that is not secure. I believe we need to deal with illegal immigration. There needs to be consequences, which is why part of my plan that I have outlined — and again, please go to KamalaHarris.com; sorry to throw a website on you, but why not? — and you will see that part of my plan includes what we need to do to actually do more as it relates to putting resources in, including increasing penalties for illegal crossings.
MR. COOPER: And just finally, on fracking. You said you're clear: You would not ban it as president. Yo- —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: No, I would not ban it as president.
MR. COOPER: Right. You're — I know — you're clear on that. Do you think it is bad for the environment though?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I think that we have proven that we can invest in a clean energy economy. We can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. We can work on a — and sustaining what we need to do to protect this beautiful earth of ours and not ban fracking.
MR. COOPER: Time is short, so I want to get some more voters in.
Taneisha Spall from Lansdowne, Pennsylvania. She works as an education administration manager for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. Registered Democrat who says she's leaning towards supporting you. Has yet to make her final decision.
Taneisha, welcome.
Q: Thank you, Anderson. Thank you, Madam Vice President —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
Q: — for joining us this evening.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Of course.
Q: I appreciate that you did acknowledge that we are a country that is faced with problems and issues. With the Supreme Court being plagued with issues, would you be in favor of expanding the court to, say, 12 so each justice has only one circuit court other than chief justice to assist in making judgments more balanced?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, to your point, I — there is no question that the American people increasingly are losing confidence in the Supreme Court, and in large part because of the behavior of certain members of that court and because of certain rulings, including the Dobbs decision and taking away a precedent that had been in place for 50 years, protecting a woman's right to make decisions about her own body.
So, I do believe that there should be some kind of reform of the court, and we can study what that actually looks like.
But I do believe — but, again, let's just — while you raise the point of the court, understand that, again, in 13 days, the American people will decide who is the next president of the United States. In 13 days, you will decide who is sitting in the Oval Office on January 20th.
And on one hand, you have in Donald Trump someone who has increasingly proved himself to be unstable and who — as we have established and the people close to him have established, he is unfit to serve. Somebody who, on January 20th, you can be sure will spend full time, like we know — and we've seen the image mentally of him sitting in the dining room off of the Oval Office, watching for hours as people violently attack the Capitol. You can be sure, because he has said he would weaponize the Department of Justice to go after his political enemies, that you can look at a Donald Trump in the White House after January 20th, sitting in that Oval Office, plotting his revenge.
He has talked about ""the enemies within."" We haven't even raised that subject, Anderson. ""The enemies within"" — he's talking about the American people. He's talking about journalists, judges, nonpartisan election officials.
He has talked about, as John Kelly has talked about, can he send the military after peaceful protesters. And he's going to sit there, unstable, unhinged, plotting his revenge, plotting his retribution, creating an enemies list.
I'm going to tell you: My list will be a list of how I address and continue to address the issues that you all are raising this afternoon and evening. It will be a to-do list about how we can impact the American people and lift up the American people and address some of the challenges that we continue to face.
MR. COOPER: I want to get one last questioner in. This is Elkan Pleat. He is a student at Temple University, registered Democrat, leaning towards voting for you, has yet to make up his final decision.
Elkan.
Q: Hi. First of all, go Birds. (Laughter.) And hi from — I'm from Danville, California.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Aww. Hi, Elkan.
Q: But my question is: What is the proudest moment of your political career thus far, including when you were the AG?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Oh, that's a great one. I've actually had a few. One of them is I, as attorney general of California, created what I named the Bureau of Children's Justice, fa- — and you may be familiar with that as a Californian. And it was f- — it was because I believe that, frankly, we still have a lot to do in terms of policy that impacts children and an investment in the children of our country is an investment in all of us and our future.
And that work has actually produced significant results. That has been a proud moment for me.
It was a proud moment for me to — to do the work that we've been doing that has addressed issues like maternal mortality. I mean, it's in response to an incredible tragedy, but lifting up that issue in a way that we agree that America should not have one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world.
So, I have had the good fortune of, in my life as a public servant, knowing the impact that we can have. And I guess that is probably what motivates me most, because I know we can make a difference. I really do.
And I do believe that the American people deserve a president who is going to be hardworking. And, you know, we'll make mistakes from time to time, but it's focused on you. And I think that is so fundamental in this election. So fundamental.
You deserve a president — I believe the American people deserve a president who is saying, ""Look, let's just be practical."" Let's get things done. And let's not be afraid of having a little joy — (laughs) — to the point of, you know, what gives you — what makes you feel good about your work. Let's — let's do it in a way that is grounded in optimism.
You know, the thing that I think we all know about who we are as the American people, we are people who are ambitious. We have aspirations. We have dreams. We are inherently optimistic — inherently optimistic.
And I — I think people are exhausted with the idea that we're just going to be divided and angry instead of working on the problems and working together. And that's what motivates me, and that's what makes me proud when we're able to do that. So —
MR. COOPER: Vice President Kamala Harris, thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
MR. COOPER: Appreciate it.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Anderson. (Applause.) Thank you.
MR. COOPER: And thanks for watching. Thanks to all the voters here. Be sure to join CNN on November 5th for election night in America, right here on CNN.
Jake Tapper and Erin Burnett pick it up right now. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Clarkston, Georgia
  


  

  
    October 24, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good evening, Georgia! (Applause.) Good evening.
Can we please hear it for my friend, our 44th president, Barack Obama? (Applause.)
Oh, it's good to be back in Atlanta. (Laughs.)
All right. All right. So —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I love you too. (Applause.) I love you too. (Laughs.)
So — so, you all may know it was over — it was 17 years ago — it was over 17 years ago when I took a trip to Springfield, Illinois. It was a cold February day, and I went there to support this brilliant young senator who was running for president of the United States. (Applause.) And millions of Americans were energized and inspired not only by Barack Obama's message but by how he leads, seeking to unite rather than separate us.
And that is why in 20- — '07, 2007, I went New Year's Eve to Iowa to knock on doors in the snow. And all these years later, Barack Obama, I say to you: Your friendship and your faith in me and in our campaign means the world. Thank you, Mr. President. (Applause.) Thank you, Mr. President.
And we have some extraordinary leaders with us tonight, and I thank everybody who's here for taking time out of your busy lives to spend this evening together.
I want to thank Georgia's congressional delegation — (applause) — all the local and community leaders who are here with us. Let's please give it up for Samuel L. Jackson — (applause); Spike Lee — (applause); Tyler Perry — (applause); and the great American poet, Bruce Springsteen. (Applause.)
So, Atlanta, before I was vice president of the United States, before I was a United States senator, and before that, a two-term attorney general for the state of California, and before that, a district attorney and a courtroom prosecutor — and in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators, fraudsters, and repeat offenders. I took them on, and I won.
Well, Georgia, in 12 days, it's Donald Trump's turn. (Applause.) (Laughs.) It's his turn.
Just 12 days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. And I don't need to tell you, voting has already started. And everybody here knows it's going to be a tight race until the very end, so we have a lot of work ahead of us. But we like hard work. Hard work is good work. (Applause.) Hard work is joyful work. (Applause.)
And make no mistake, we will win. (Applause.) We will win. We will win.
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Or as a certain former president would say, ""Yes, we can."" (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Yes, we can! Yes, we can! Yes, we can!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes, we will, and, yes, we can. And here's — here's why we're going to win. We are going to win because we, together, are fighting for the future. (Applause.) We are fighting for the future. We here understand we have an opportunity before us to turn the page on the fear and divisiveness that have characterized our politics for a decade because of Donald Trump.
We have the opportunity to turn the page and chart a new way and a joyful way forward — (applause) — a way that taps into the ambitions, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people.
And I will tell you, as I travel our country, there is an overwhelming call for a fresh start, for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic and excited about what we can do together. There is a yearning for a president of the United States who will see you, who gets you, and who will fight for you. (Applause.)
And my whole career, I have put the people before partisanship. I never once asked somebody, ""Are you a Democrat, or are you a Republican?"" Instead, I always asked, ""How can I help you?"" (Applause.)
And that is a major difference between Donald Trump and me and between the two very different — extremely different visions that he and I have for our nation: one, his, focused on the past and himself; the other, ours, focused on the future and you.
Together, we will build a future where we bring down the cost of living, and that will be my focus every single day as president of the United States. (Applause.) Because, look, while inflation is down and wages are up, prices are still too high. You know it, and I know it.
And unlike Donald Trump, who had $400 million served to him on a silver platter and still minag- — managed to file for bankruptcy six times — he talks about being a good businessman. Come on. (Laughter.) Unlike him, I grew up in a middle-class neighborhood with a working mother who kept a strict budget and did everything she could to make sure my sister and I had all that we needed. I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. (Applause.) I will never forget where I come from.
Which is why my commonsense plan will lower the prices you pay on everything from prescription drugs to groceries to housing. On the other hand, Donald Trump will raise costs on you and your families.
In fact, independent economists have analyzed our plans and found that mine will cut your costs and strengthen our economy; his will increase inflation and lead to a recession by the middle of next year. These are independent economists — Nobel laureate, prize-winning economists who have reviewed our plans and are very clear.
And his agenda is all laid out in Project 2025, a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president.
And, look, Donald Trump intends to impose a 20 percent Trump national sales tax on everyday basic necessities —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — which will cost the average family nearly $4,000 a year.
On the other hand, I will take on price gouging — corporate price gouging. I've done it before, and I will do it again. (Applause.)
Donald Trump will give massive tax cuts to billionaires and the biggest corporations, exactly like he did the last time he was president.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I will give middle-class tax cuts to 100 million Americans, including $6,000 during the first year of a child's life that will also lift — that will also lift America's children out of poverty. (Applause.)
Donald Trump will get rid of the $35 cap on insulin for seniors. He will cut Medicare and Social Security. In fact, economists have reported he will bankrupt Social Security in just six years.
My plan is a plan to support our seniors so that they can grow older with dignity and so their families — you — are not overwhelmed by the cost of home health care. (Applause.)
And on top of that, my plan will bring down the cost of housing, cut taxes for small businesses — where are the small businesses in the house? — (applause) — you are the backbone of America's economy, all of you — and we will lower health care costs because I believe health care should be a right and not just the privilege of those who can afford it. (Applause.)
Donald Trump, on the other hand, intends to end the Affordable Care Act — or, like we like to call it, Obamacare. (Applause.) And he wants to take us back to when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions.
Well, we are —
AUDIENCE: Not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — not going back. We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We're not going back. No, we are not, because we will move forward, and it is time to turn the page. (Applause.)
Ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom — for freedom, like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
And we — we remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended. And now, in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban.
I don't need to tell the folks here: Except for Virginia, in every state in the South, including Georgia, there is a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest.
And let me tell you, the idea that someone who survives a crime of a violation to their body would be told they don't have the authority to make a decision about what happens to their body next — that is immoral. It is immoral. It is immoral. (Applause.)
And everybody here knows, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do. (Applause.) Not the government. If she chooses, she will talk with her pastor, her priest, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government, not some folks up in a state capitol telling her what to do with her own body.
And notice, Donald Trump still refuses to even acknowledge the pain and the suffering he has caused.
He insists that, quote, ""everybody"" wanted for Roe v. Wade to be overturned —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — which is just a further example of how out of touch the man is. Everybody wanted this? Women are being denied care during miscarriages, some only being treated once they develop sepsis. They didn't want this.
Couples just trying to grow their family have been cut off in the middle of IVF treatments. They didn't want this.
Women have died because of these bans, including a young mother of a six-year-old son right here in Georgia. Her family is here with us tonight, and we speak her name: Amber Nicole Thurman. (Applause.)
And you all have heard me say, look, I do believe Donald Trump to be an unserious man, and the consequences of him ever being president again are brutally serious.
These are just some of the consequences of the Trump abortion bans and what he does and what he's likely to do.
And I pledge to you, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly.
And across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights — fundamental freedoms and rights — like, Georgia knows, attacks on the freedom to vote, attacks on the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.)
And as Atlanta knows well, generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom, and now the baton is in our hands. It is in our hands. (Applause.)
And so, I'd like to speak in particular to all the young leaders that I see here this evening. (Applause.) I see you. I see you. I see you. And to you, I say, you all have grabbed the baton. I've seen what you do, and I see how you are doing it, because you are rightly impatient for change.
You, who have only known the climate crisis, are leading the charge to protect our planet and our future. (Applause.)
You, young leaders who grew up with active-shooter drills, are fighting to keep our schools safe. (Applause.)
You, who know now fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers, are standing up for reproductive freedom. (Applause.)
And I know it is because for you — I say to our young leaders — this is not theoretical, this is not political, this is your lived experience. And what I love about you is you are not waiting for other people to figure this out. (Applause.)
So, I see you, and I see your power. And I know so many of you are voting for the first time and know that our future is so good with you all at the helm. (Applause.) And I'm so proud of you.
Can we hear it for our young leaders and first-time voters? (Applause.)
So, listen, so much is on the line in this election, and this is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher, because over the last years — and, in particular, the last eight years — Donald Trump has become more confused, more unstable, and more angry. You see it every day. He has become increasingly unhinged.
But last time, at least there were people around him who could control him. But do notice, in this election, they're not with him this time.
In fact, just this week, America heard from John Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general, who was Trump's White House chief of staff, who said that, as president, Trump praised Hitler — take a moment to think about what that means — that Trump said, quote, ""Hitler did some good things"" —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and that Trump wished he had generals like Hitler's, who would be loyal to Trump and not to America's Constitution.
This is not 2016 and it is not 2020, including because just a few months ago, the United States Supreme Court told the former president that he is effectively immune no matter what he does in the White House.
Now, just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails — he who will claim unchecked and extreme power if he is reelected, who has vowed that he will be a dictator on day one, who calls Americans who disagree with him — I'm going to quote — ""the enemy from within."" You know what that harkens back to? He's calling Americans ""the enemy within.""
Who says that he would use the military to go after them. And he who has called for the, quote, ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States.
Let us be very clear. Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States of America should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States of America. (Applause.) Never again. Never again.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, America, there is a huge contrast in this election. Just imagine — just imagine the Oval Office in three months. Picture it in your mind.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You're going to be there! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It is either — so — but there's a choice that everybody has. So, let's imagine it for a moment.
It's either Donald Trump in there, stewing — stewing over his enemies list, or me — (applause) — working for you, checking off my to-do list.
You have the power to make that decision. It is your power. It is your power.
AUDIENCE: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, 12 — 12 days.
AUDIENCE: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: All right. So — okay, we got work to do. We got work to do.
Okay. So, Georgia, listen, it all comes down to this. We are here together because we know what is at stake. We are here together because we love our country. We love our country. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to fight, then, for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. That's why we are here.
And as the great Congressman John Lewis reminded us, democracy is not a state; it is an act.
So, Georgia, now is our time to act. And together, we will win. We will win. (Applause.) We will win.
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, Election Day —
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, Election Day is in 12 days, okay? Twelve days. And early voting has already started.
So, Georgia, we need you to vote early. Please vote early. Go to IWillVote.com to get all the information you might need, because, folks, the election is here. It is here. It is upon us, and the choice is truly in your hands.
Your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. (Applause.)
So, Georgia, I ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Kelly and Beyoncé! (Applause.)
Hey, Texas! (Applause.)
Oh, it's good to be back in Texas. (Applause.)
Thank you all. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, everybody. Thank you for being here this evening.
Can we hear it for Ms. Tina Knowles? (Applause.) For Ms. Kelly? (Applause.) And Beyoncé? (Applause.)
What a warm Texas welcome. I thank you all so very much, and I thank you, and I thank my friends for reminding us of exactly what we are fighting for in this campaign. We are fighting for freedom. (Applause.) Freedom. Freedom.
And to Andrea and everyone here tonight whose lives have been impacted by these Trump abortion bans, in this moment, I thank you for sharing your stories and for your courage. It is an honor to be here with so many leaders and all of you who have taken the time out of your busy lives to be here this evening so we can, as a community of people, as people who love our country, be clear, sound strong, and stand in favor of the freedom of every woman to make decisions about her
own body. (Applause.)
I also want to thank the members of Congress who are here, including Colin Allred. (Applause.) I'm counting on you to send him to the United States Senate so we can get right to work. (Applause.)
And to all the elected officials and community leaders, I thank you all. I thank you.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) See you later. See you later.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's okay.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: See —
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back.
And we have — and we have a lot of work to do. And we have a lot of work to do, and we will not get distracted. (Applause.) We will not get distracted.
So, listen, Texas, we have 11 days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. Voting has already started, and we know this will be a tight race until the very end.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay. So, here's the thing. Here — hey, g- — okay, so we got work to do. We got work to do. We got work to do. And I love that there is so much enthusiasm, but let's talk about the work we've got to do — (applause) — okay — because we've got 11 days to see this through. And we will win. (Applause.) We will win. We will win.
And we will win — and we will win because we know and understand what is at stake. We are 11 days out from an election that will decide the future of America, including the freedom of every woman to make decisions about her own body and her reproductive freedom. (Applause.)
And everyone here tonight is here because we are about fighting for our future and not letting some people take us back. (Applause.) Because we are not going back. We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And in America, we know freedom is not to be given. It is not to be bestowed. It is ours by right, and we are prepared to fight for it — (applause) — because we understand the stakes.
And moving forward, we understand that what we must do, Texas, is right here, you, who are ground zero in the fight for reproductive freedom, we must be loud. We must organize. We must mobilize. We must energize the people. (Applause.)
Because you all know, Texas is home to one of the most restrictive abortion bans in our country.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: In Texas, abortion is banned from the moment of conception.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You know what? You know what? Just send them to that small rally down the street. (Applause.) It'll be fine. Some people don't have a great sense of direction, but that's okay. We'll show them the way. We'll show them the way.
Come on.
Because we know what's at stake, and we will not be silenced. We know what's happening here in Texas. Doctors and nurses could go to prison for life simply for providing reproductive care. Think about that. Life in prison for health care providers for doing what they think is in their patients' best interest.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You know what? The beauty of our campaign is we're fighting for democracy. (Applause.)
And what we know here in Texas is that there are some who would distract from the fact that Texas has a law now that offers a cash bounty for turning in someone who merely helps a friend or family member get the care they need.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
In Texas, the law provides for prison for life for health care providers for doing what they believe is in the best interest of their patient. In some counties in Texas, there — they have passed travel bans to prevent women from going to other states to receive care. These are the stakes.
And we know how we got here. When Donald Trump was president, he hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did.
And now, more than 20 states have a Trump abortion ban. Now, one in three American women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, including Texas and every state in the South except for Virginia. And many of these bans are causing care to be denied until a woman is at death's door. Many have no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral.
And let us agree, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body. (Applause.) Not the government.
If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government and some people up in the state legislature — (applause) — telling her what's in her best interest when she knows what's in her own best interest.
And let us recognize: These same people — check this out — these same people who have argued that these Trump abortion bans are in the best interest of women and children, do look at their records. They tend to be in states with the highest rate of maternal mortality in the country.
For decades, these extremist leaders who have neglected prenatal care, maternity care, and postpartum care and who now, after continuously failing to support women and children, claim to care about women and children. Well, I have a question for them: Where you been? Where you been? (Applause.) Where you been when it comes to prioritizing care for women and children? Where have you been when it comes to helping pregnant women and new mothers? Where have you been when it comes to affordable child care? (Applause.)
And do note, many of these same extremist leaders have also refused to extend the Child Tax Credit, which lifted half of America's children out of poverty; they, who have blocked proposals to lower child care costs for working parents; they who have tried to cut WIC and SNAP for low-income mothers and their children. The hypocrisy abounds.
And here's what else is happening: These bans are driving doctors out of states like Texas, Idaho, Georgia, and North Carolina, leaving women who are already living in maternity care deserts — meaning there is no maternity care anywhere near them — leaving them with even fewer options. And since Trump abortion bans, fewer medical students are choosing to specialize in women's health.
Over these past two years, the impact of Trump abortion bans has been devastating. We see the horrific reality that women and families face every single day, and the stories are vivid. They are difficult to hear. They are difficult to tell.
For example, here in Texas — can we roll the tape?
(A video is played.)
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: From his own mouth, ""a great thing."" There is nothing great about what happened to women like Kate Cox, who was heartbroken to learn her much-wanted pregnancy was not viable; heartbroken when her doctors told her if she remained pregnant, she would be risking her own life or her ability to have children in the future. But the attorney general of Texas —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — threatened — threatened if Kate's doctors helped terminate her pregnancy, they would be criminally prosecuted. So, Kate was forced to flee the state to get the care she needed.
In Louisiana, Kaitlyn Joshua was turned away from not one but two emergency rooms while miscarrying. She was bleeding. She was in pain. But because of a Trump abortion ban, doctors would not treat her, because if they did, they would have faced 15 years in prison. And so, Kal- — Kaitlyn had to go home, where she went through the pain of a miscarriage for more than a month and trying — the whole time — to hide her pain from her four-year-old daughter. We know that women have died because of Trump abortion bans.
Here today is Shanette Williams, the mother of Amber Nicole Thurman, a vibrant — (applause) — we must speak her name, Amber Nicole Thurman. (Applause.) I promised her mother I would speak her name. A vibrant 28-year-old mother of a 6-year-old son who died a preventable death because of Georgia's abortion ban. Now, Shanette and her family are courageously sharing Amber's story to make sure we all remember her as more than a statistic so that we remember Amber was a daughter, a sister, a mother, and that she was loved and that she should be alive today. (Applause.)
And listen, we're all here because we know the reality is, for every story we hear about — about the suffering because of a Trump abortion ban, there are so many stories we've never heard, an untold number of women and the people who love them, who are silently suffering — women who are being made to feel as though they did something wrong, as though they are criminals, as though they are alone. And to those women, I say — and I think I speak on behalf of all of us: We see you, and we are here with you. (Applause.)
Texas, what is happening across this state and our country is a health care crisis, and Donald Trump is the architect of it. He brags about overturning Roe v. Wade. In his own words, quote, ""I did it, and I'm proud to have done it."" That's what he says.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And one has to ask: Proud that women are dying? Proud that doctors and nurses could be thrown in prison for life for administering lifesaving care? Proud that young women in America today have fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers?
How dare he? Donald Trump — (applause) — Donald Trump even said everyone wanted Roe v. Wade to be overturned.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, a woman in Ohio was arrested and charged after having a miscarriage, so was a woman in South Carolina. They didn't want this.
Hadley Duval, who became pregnant after being raped by her stepfather when she was 12 years old, she didn't want this.
Ryan Hamilton, who is here tonight — his wife was denied treatment at the hospital for a miscarriage. They got home; he found her bleeding and unconscious. He dressed her, put her in a car, packed up their nine-month-old child and drove to a different emergency room, where doctors told them she could have died. Ryan didn't want this. Let's be clear.
And the men across America — this needs to be said — men across America do not want to see their daughters and wives and sisters and mothers put at risk because their rights have been taken. (Applause.) I see the men here, and I thank you.
The men of America don't want this.
AUDIENCE: No!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And now, the attorney general of Texas is suing the United States government —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — so that Texas prosecutors can get — check this out — so that Texas prosecutors can get their hands on private medical records of women who leave the state to get care.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Now, I'd ask everybody here, please do see the irony. Okay? Listen to this.
On the one hand, Donald Trump won't let anyone see his medical records. (Laughter and applause.) I gave up mine.
And on the other hand, they want to get their hands on your medical records.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Simply put, they are out of their mind. (Applause.)
In just four years as president, Donald Trump was able to erase half a century of hard-fought progress for women, and now he wants to go even further.
He will force all 50 states to track and report on women's miscarriages and abortions and go after access to contraception and IVF treatment. It's right there in his Project 2025. Google it.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And let us be clear: If Donald Trump wins again, he will ban abortion nationwide.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And though we are in Texas tonight, I say it to the folks who might be watching from home — for anyone watching from another state, know this: If you think you are protected from Trump abortion bans because you live in Michigan or Pennsylvania or Nevada or New York or California or any state where voters or legislators have protected reproductive freedom, please know no one is protected if there is a Trump national abortion ban, and it will outlaw abortion in every single state.
Understand that. And he can do it with or without an act of Congress.
All that to say: Elections matter. (Applause.) Elections matter.
If Donald Trump is president again, he will likely get to appoint at least one additional Supreme Court justice.
Remember who we appointed? Call her Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. (Applause.)
But if he were — if he were reelected, he'd probably get to appoint one, if not two, members to the United States Supreme Court, at which point Donald Trump will have packed the court with five out of nine justices on that court who will sit —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — but think about that — who will sit for lifetime appointments, shaping your lives and the lives of generations to come. And that is among the many critical contrasts in this election.
Look, Donald Trump doesn't trust women, but I do. We trust women. And we understand what's at stake. (Applause.)
And with Colin Allred in the United States Senate, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, I will proudly sign it into law as president of the United States. (Applause.) Proudly. Proudly.
So, to all the friends here, let us remember: Momentum is on our side.
I know sometimes in Texas, folks are like, ""Is it worth it? Is it — does it make a difference?"" Yes, it does. You are making a difference. And momentum is on our side. (Applause.) You are making a difference.
Since Roe was overturned, every time reproductive freedom has been on the ballot, from Kansas to California to Kentucky, in Michigan, Montana, Vermont, and Ohio, the people of America have voted for freedom every time it's been on the ballot. (Applause.)
And often, they have voted by overwhelming margins from so-called red to so-called blue states, proving this is not a partisan issue.
Because Americans from all backgrounds and beliefs understand the decision of whether, when, and how to build a family is one of the most consequential decisions anyone can make, and we are fighting for an America where no matter who you are, where you live, you can make decisions about your own body for yourself. (Applause.)
So, moving forward, all of this is to say, reproductive freedom is on the ballot in this presidential election. And in 10 states around the country — including Arizona, Florida, and Nevada, and with the work of everyone here, freedom will win. Freedom will win. (Applause.)
And so, I want to take a moment to speak in particular to all the young leaders here and across America. Do we have anybody here from Gen-Z? (Applause.) Where are you at? Where are you at? (Applause.)
I'm counting on you, because the thing I love about you is you are impatient for change. (Applause.) You know it ain't right that you may have fewer rights than your mother or your grandmother. You know it is not theoretical. You know it is not political. It is your lived experience.
And I see you, and I see your power. (Applause.) I see your power. And I know so many of you are voting for the first time. Can I see a raise of hands? (Applause.)
Can we applaud our leaders who are voting for the first time? (Applause.)
All right. We heard it for our young leaders. That's right.
So, listen to everyone here, we know freedom has never come easy. Never come easy. There has been no moment of our progress as a country that did not come about without a fight. Let's all be clear about that. And we are in the midst of a movement, and everyone here is a leader in that movement.
So, we do this, then, remembering those who came before us, those who struggled and sacrificed for our freedoms, who found fellowship and even joy in one another in the fight. They found strength and hope in fighting for our ideals, and that is what we are doing. That is what we are doing, because we know weeping may endure for a night — (applause) — but joy cometh in the morning. (Applause.)
So, Texas, Election Day is in 11 days. (Applause.) Early voting has already begun. (Applause.) So, now it is time to start making your plan. Go to IWillVote.com to get all the information you need.
And it is not only the presidency that is on the ballot. There are many important races, including Colin Allred running for Senate — (applause) — who, we must note, his opponent supported a national abortion ban six times —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — an opponent who said he does not support exceptions, even for victims of rape and incest.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, let's remember, Texas: Your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. (Applause.)
So, today, I ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we trust women? (Applause.)
Do we believe in reproductive freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Kalamazoo, Michigan
  


  

  
    October 26, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Can we hear it for Michelle Obama? (Applause.)
Good afternoon, Michigan! (Applause.) Good afternoon. Hi. Hi, guys. (Applause.) We're doing this! We're doing this! (Laughs.) (Applause.)
All right. Okay. Oh, it's great to be in Kalamazoo. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Thank you, guys. Thank — okay. Okay. All right. Thank you. Okay. We got some work to do. We got some work to do. We got some work to do.
Can we please — can we please applaud my dear and incredible friend, the former first lady, Michelle Obama? (Applause.)
And I just have to say, you — I've known Michelle for years, and she is an inspiration. I know everybody here knows this. She is a truth — she is a truth-teller, and she motivates us to get to work, especially when the stakes are high because, as she reminds us, as my mother taught me, ""Don't just sit around and complain about injustice.""
AUDIENCE: ""Do something!""
THE VICE PRESIDENT: ""Do something.""
And there are so many incredible leaders here tonight, but I want to first just thank everybody because there is so much you could be doing with your time right now, and you are here and we are here as community, as coalition builders, because we love our country. And I thank you for being here, and I thank you for all your work. (Applause.) I thank you. I thank you. I thank you.
And I want to give a shout-out to Lieutenant Governor Gilchrist — (applause) — he's over there somewhere; Senator Gary Peters. (Applause.)
And all the union, elected, and community leaders here today, I thank you. (Applause.)
I want to give a special thank you to former Republican Congressman Fred Upton — (applause) — who represented Kalamazoo for decades and has endorsed our campaign because, as he put it, ours is the team that will ""bring people together, strengthen our economy, and get things done for the American people."" (Applause.)
So, Kalamazoo, listen, bef- — you all know, before I was vice president, I was a United States senator —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Kamala-zoo!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and before that, I was a —
I know you want to say ""Kamala-zoo."" I heard you. (Laughter and applause.)
Okay. All right. Okay. We got that out of the way. Okay. (Laughs.)
So, listen, before I was vice president and — before that, I was a two-term attorney general of California. I was a senator, the two-term attorney general of California, and before that, a district attorney, and before that, a courtroom prosecutor. (Applause.)
And — and in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators, fraudsters, and repeat offenders. I took them on, and I won. (Applause.) Well, Michigan, in 10 days, it's Donald Trump's turn. (Applause.) (Laughs.) Yep. Yep.
So, listen, we've got just 10 days left.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, you know, I hear your chant. But, listen, the courts are going to handle that; we're going to handle November. Okay? (Applause.) (Inaudible.)
So, look, we've got just 10 days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. As you all know, voting has already started. (Applause.) And everybody here knows this is going to be a tight race until the very end, so we have a lot of work to do.
But we like hard work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And make no mistake, we will win. (Applause.) We will win. We will win. We will win. We will. Yes, we will.
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I got something for —
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Or — or, as a certain former president would say, ""Yes, we can."" (Laughs.) (Applause.)
So, yes, we can, and, yes, we will. And we will win because, together — and this is about all of us — we are fighting for America's future.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No more Gaza war!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we understand —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No more Gaza war! No more Gaza war!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — the opportunity we have before us —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Have you no decency?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — to turn the page —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No more Gaza war!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — on the fear —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay. Thank you all. Thank you all. Thank you all.
And, listen, on the topic of Gaza, we must end that war. (Applause.) And we must end the war and bring the hostages home. But now I am speaking about 2024. All right.
So, listen, we have to understand the opportunity we have before us to turn the page on the fear and the divisiveness that have characterized our politics for a decade because of Donald Trump. We have an opportunity to turn the page and chart a new and joyful way — dare I say, joyful way forward — (applause) — where we tap into the ambition and the aspirations and the dreams of the American people.
And I'm going to tell you, as I travel around our country, there is an overwhelming call for a fresh start — (applause) — for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic and excited about what we can do together. (Applause.)
There is a yearning in our country for a president who sees the people, not just looking in the mirror all the time — (laughter) — but sees the people, who gets you, and who will fight for you. (Applause.) That is what this election is about.
And my whole career, I have put the people above partisanship. I never asked somebody, ""Are you a Democrat or a Republican"" before I offered help. Instead, the first and only thing I asked is, ""How can I help you?"" (Applause.)
And that is a major difference between Donald Trump and me and between the two extremely different visions that he and I have for our nation.
One, his, focused on the past and himself; the other, ours, focused on the future and you and your family. (Applause.)
And together, we will build a future where we bring down the cost of living, and that will be my focus every single day as president.
Because, look, while inflation is down and wages are up, prices are still too high. You know it, and I know it. And unlike Donald Trump, who had $400 million handed to him on a silver platter and then filed for bankruptcy six times —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — I grew up in a middle-class neighborhood with a working mother who kept a strict budget and did everything she could to make sure my sister and I had all that we needed.
I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. (Applause.) I will never forget where I come from.
And so, my commonsense plan is about lowering the prices you pay on everything from prescription medication to groceries to housing.
On the other hand, Donald Trump will raise costs on the families of America. In fact, independent economists — independent economists have analyzed our plans and found that mine will cut your costs and strengthen our economy, while his will increase inflation and lead to a recession by the middle of next year.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And his agenda is all laid out in Project 2025 —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — which, I still must say, I cannot believe they put that in writing. (Laughter and applause.) I mean, they put it in writing, they bound it, they handed it out. (Laughter.) And if you get your hands on it — google it — it's a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president.
Donald Trump will impose a 20 percent Trump national sales tax on everyday basic necessities, which will cost — the economists have measured it — will cost the average family nearly $4,000 a year.
On the other hand, I will take on an issue like corporate price gouging. (Applause.) I've done it before, and I will do it again.
Donald Trump will give massive tax cuts to billionaires and the biggest corporations, exactly like he did the last time he was president.
I will give middle-class tax cuts to 100 million Americans, including $6,000 during the first year of a child's life that will also lift America's children out of poverty. (Applause.)
Donald Trump — again, read his plan — will get rid of the $35 cap on insulin for seniors.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He will cut Medicare and Social Security.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: In fact, recently, it was published, independent economists say he will bankrupt Social Security in the next six years.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And what everybody here knows: We have so many seniors whose only source of income is their Social Security check. (Applause.) And we believe that our seniors should be able to retire with dignity, not worried about whether they're going to have a roof over their head. (Applause.)
And we believe that their families also should not be overwhelmed by the cost of home health care, which is why my plan includes ensuring that instead of you, who are taking care of your elder relative — you know, I took care of my mother when she was sick, and I know what that is like. It's about trying to cook something that they feel like eating. It's about trying to help them put on a sweater. It's about trying to say something that maybe will bring a smile to their face and maybe make them laugh from time to time. It's about their dignity.
But we have a lot of people right now living in what we call the ""sandwich generation,"" who are taking care of your kids while you're taking care of your parents. (Applause.) And that's a lot. It's a lot.
And too many people either — well, either, if you are fortunate enough, you may have some extra money that you can hire somebody, but most people can't. So, what that means is so many people have to think about leaving work, quitting their job, which means cutting a source of income, or spending down all of your savings to be able to qualify for Medicaid.
It's just not right. So, part of my plan says that we're going to make sure that Medicare covers the cost of home health care for our seniors. (Applause.)
It's about dignity. It's about dignity. It's about seeing people where they are and understanding the burdens people face and lifting folks up instead of trying to beat people down, which is exactly what we see on the other side. (Applause.)
On top of that, my plan will bring down the cost of housing, because we know housing is too expensive. And for so many people — you know, generations ago, folks could kind of count on the American dream, but it's out of reach for far too many people. And so, we're going to bring down the cost of housing, including creating incentives for more home building, and we are going to create a $25,000 down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers — (applause) — just to get your foot in the door. Because the way I see, it's not enough that you're just able to get by. I want you to be able to get ahead. (Applause.)
We're going to cut taxes for small businesses, because small businesses are the backbone of America's economy. (Applause.)
Do we have any small-business owners here? (Applause.) Right. I love our small businesses.
We're going to lower health care costs, because, look, I believe health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who have the money to afford it. (Applause.)
On the other hand, we've got Donald Trump —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — who intends to end the Affordable Care Act — or, as we like to call it, Obamacare — (applause) — and he would take us back to when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was like?
Well, we are —
AUDIENCE: Not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — not going back. We are not going back, because we are about moving forward — (applause) — and it is time to turn the page.
So, ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom, like the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
And remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. They did as he intended. And now, one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — many with no exceptions for rape and incest.
And the idea that somebody who survives a crime of a violation to their body would not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next, that is immoral.
And let us agree, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree that the government shouldn't be telling her what to do. (Applause.) Not the government. Not the government. If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government. Come on. Some folks up in a state capitol telling you what's in your best interest, like you don't know?
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Not in Michigan!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Not in Michigan, but, look, if there's a national — if — if — look, if there's a national abortion ban, nobody is safe. And that's why I so thank everybody for being here, knowing this is at stake for everybody and fighting for everybody's rights. (Applause.)
And I'll tell you, so, I was in — I — I actually just got in from Texas. And I did an event in Texas last night, in Houston. And — (applause) — and if you saw it, you probably saw some of the stories about what has been happening in our country — the suffering — the suffering.
And, you know, Donald Trump still refuses to even acknowledge the pain and suffering he has caused. He insists that, and I'm going to quote, ""everybody"" wanted Roe v. Wade to be overturned.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Come on. Everybody wanted this? Women are being denied care during miscarriages, some only being treated once they developed sepsis. They didn't want this.
Couples just trying to grow their family who have been cut off from IVF treatments. They didn't want this.
The men of America seeing their daughters, wives, sisters, and mothers put at risk because their rights have been stripped away. The men of America don't want this.
AUDIENCE: Noo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Women have died because of these bans. How could anybody say that they wanted this?
And you have heard me say, I do believe Donald Trump to be an unserious man, but the consequences of him ever being president again are brutally serious — brutally serious. (Applause.) And what I mentioned are just some of the consequences of what he has done.
And I will tell you, I pledge to you, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly. Proudly, with your help.
And so, look, we are — and I'm traveling our country. And I'm going to tell you, across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote.
You know, in Georgia, they got a law that makes it illegal to give people food and water for standing in line to vote. The hypocrisy abounds. What happened to love thy neighbor?
Attacks on the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.)
All of these things are at stake. And generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom, and now the baton is in our hands. (Applause.) Now the baton is in our hands.
And on that point, I want to speak, in particular, to all of the young leaders who are here today. Can I see Gen Z? (Applause.) I love you guys. I love you. Let me tell you — (laughs) — see? And of the many things that I just think are so great about you, you are rightly impatient for change. (Applause.) I love that. I love that.
You, who have only known the climate crisis, are leading the charge to protect our planet and our future. You, who grew up with active shooter drills, are fighting to keep our schools safe. (Applause.) You, who now know fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers, are standing up for reproductive freedom.
And for you all, these issues are not theoretical, they're not political; they're your lived experience. And I want to tell you, I see you, and I see your power. (Applause.)
And I know many of you are voting for the first time. Who's voting for the first time? (Applause.) Can we hear it for our young leaders and first-time voters? (Applause.)
Yeah. There we go. That's what this is about, right? That's why we're all here together. It's about our future.
So, listen, so much is on the line in this election. You all know that.
And this is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher because, over the last eight years, Donald Trump has become more confused, more unstable, and more angry. And it is clear he has become increasingly unhinged, but the last time at least there were people who could control him. But notice they're not with him this time.
And then a few months ago, the Supreme Court told the former president he is effectively immune no matter what he does in the White House.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's not 2016 or 2020 when you think about that, because just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. He who will claim unchecked and extreme power if he is reelected. He who has vowed he will be a dictator on day one. He who has said he wished he had generals like Hitler's.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Who calls — who calls Americans who disagree with him, ""the enemy from within."" You know what that harkens back to? And he says he would use the American military to go after them.
Donald Trump has even called for the, quote, ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States of America.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And let us be very clear, someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. (Applause.) Never again. Never again. Never again. No.
So, there is a huge contrast in this election, and I'm going to ask everyone to just imagine the Oval Office in three months. So, you can picture it. So — but here's what I say to the folks who are watching: It's either Donald Trump in there stewing over his enemies list, or me, working for you, checking off my to-do list. (Applause.) And you have the power to make that decision. You have the power to make that decision.
And this is the beauty of our democracy, as long as we can hold on to it: The power is with the people. The power is with the people to make that decision.
And so, Michigan, it all comes down to this: We are all here together because we know what is at stake, and we are here together, most importantly, because we love our country. We love our country. (Applause.) We love our country.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And to love our country — to love our country is to know that one of the highest forms of patriotism, I believe, is to then fight for the ideals of our country. And that's what we are all here together to say, ""We love our country, and we are prepared to fight for our country and to fight to realize the promise of America."" (Applause.) The promise of America, that's what this is about.
So, Election Day is in 10 days. (Applause.) And early voting has already started. (Applause.) And you can vote early, starting today, through Sunday, November 3rd. (Applause.) So, we need you to vote early, Michigan. (Applause.)
And now, then is the time to make your plan to vote. And you can go to IWillVote.com to get all the information you need.
And if you have received your ballot in the mail, please do not wait, fill it out and return it today — (applause) — because, folks, the election is here. It is here, and the choice is truly in your hands. And your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. (Applause.) It's your power.
So, Michigan, today, I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God Bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

And through our campaign — our campaign — yes, we will win. That is our highest and that is our achievable goal. We will win. And in the process, over these next 10 days, we are also doing the work of building community, building coalitions, reminding folks that we are all in this together, lifting each other up, reminding ourselves and each other that we have so much more in common than what separates us.
That's what our campaign is about. It is a people-powered campaign. (Applause.) And because it is a people-powered campaign, we will win, because we know what we stand for, so we know what to fight for. (Applause.)

AUDIENCE: MVP! MVP! MVP!

AUDIENCE: MVP! MVP! MVP!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you all.

Okay. All right.
Hey, Philly, it's good to be back. (Applause.) It's good to be back. And can we hear it for Coach Butler? (Applause.) Thank you.
So, Philly, I've got a question for you: Are you ready to do this? (Applause.) Are we gonna do this? (Applause.) Yes! Are we ready to vote? (Applause.) Are we ready to win? (Applause.)
It's good to be back. (Applause.) (Laughs.)
So, I want to thank all the incredible leaders who are here. I want to start with Mayor Parker. Where are you, Mayor? (Applause.) A phenomenal leader. She has been an extraordinary friend.
Speaker McClinton, thank you. (Applause.) Representatives Dean and Scanlon, thank you. (Applause.) And let's send Bob Casey back to the United States Senate. (Applause.)
And to all the community and elected leaders here, I thank you. I had a chance to visit with many of you this afternoon. I thank you for the leadership you provide in so many ways.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I love you back. I love you back. (Applause.)
So, to everyone here, I thank you. I thank you, because you have taken time this afternoon, this Sunday afternoon, out of your busy lives, for us to all be here together under one roof to make the point that we are all in this together. (Applause.) We are all in this together.
And we are all here together because we also understand how high the stakes are at this very moment.
Philly, we've got nine days — nine days — nine days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. And we know this is going to be a tight race until the very end, so we have a lot of work ahead of us. But we like hard work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work. (Applause.) Hard work is joyful work. (Applause.)
And make no mistake: We will win. We will win. We will win. We will win. (Applause.)
And we will win because here's how I think about it: When you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. (Applause.) And this election is about two extremely different visions for our nation: one, Donald Trump's, who is focused on the past and himself —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And here's why — here's why: Because we — because we are focused on the future, and we are focused on the needs of the American people, as opposed to a Donald Trump, who spends full time looking in the mirror, focused on himself. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hey, you know what? Hold — hold on a second. Listen — no, hold on. Hold on. Let's — I want to talk about Gaza for a minute. I want to talk about Gaza for a minute. Okay?
We can and we must seize this opportunity to end this war and bring the hostages home. (Applause.) And I will do everything in my power to meet that end. (Applause.)
And we are here because we are fighting for our democracy — (applause) — and we respect the voices of all people — (applause) — and we've got a job to do in the next nine days to fight for this da- — democracy we love. (Applause.) Nine days.
And we understand we have an opportunity before us to turn the page on the fear and the divisiveness that have characterized our politics for a decade because of Donald Trump. We have the ability to turn the page on that same old, tired playbook, because we are exhausted with it — (applause) — and we are ready to chart a new way forward.
And, yes, we will be joyful in the process. (Applause.) Yes, we like to laugh. (Applause.) Yes, we know that when you care about the people and you understand what you are fighting for, there is joy in that fight, and that is why we are all in this together. (Applause.)
We are fighting for a future of our nation where we tap into the ambitions and the aspirations and the dreams of the American people. We are a new generation of leadership that is optimistic and excited about what our nation can do together. (Applause.)
And the great thing about living in a democracy, as long as we keep it, is that we the people have the power to choose the direction of our country and its leadership. The power is with the people. (Applause.)
And from the beginning, our campaign has been about building coalitions and building community. Look, over the next nine days, like I said, we are going to win. That is our highest order. But through that process, to all the friends here, I say: Let's be intentional about building community. Let's be intentional about building coalitions. (Applause.) Let's be intentional about understanding we all have so much more in common than what separates us. We will be the better for it. (Applause.)
That's what our campaign is about, because we know we are all in this together. We have so much more in common than what separates us. And we are going to fight for the country we love. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And — and that is why we are all here together, because we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country. And you got to fight for the thing you love. You got to fight for the thing you love.
And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism, the expression of the love of our country, to then fight for its ideals. It is the highest form of patriotism, and one of the most powerful ways we do that is with our vote. (Applause.)
So — all right. So, everybody is here because you're prepared to do the work. So, here we are. From now until election day, we are going to get out the vote here in Pennsylvania. (Applause.)
And if you'll give me a minute, I really right now want to speak to the young leaders who are here. Is Gen Z in the house? (Applause.) Who in — who is voting for their first time in their first election? (Applause.) All right.
Now, here's the thing I love about you young leaders. You know, you are rightly impatient for change. (Applause.) You are rightly impatient.
You, who have only known the climate crisis — you are leaders in what we need to do to protect our planet. (Applause.)
You, who grew up with active shooter drills — you know what we have to do to fight for safety in our schools. (Applause.)
You, who right now know fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers, understand the importance of fighting for the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
And this is why I love you, the young leaders who are here, because, for you, this is not theoretical. This is not political. This is not about some debate. It is about your lived experience. And you are here — and I see you because I see your power — and you are here because you know your power. And I am so proud of you. (Applause.)
And, everyone, let us applaud our young leaders, our first-time voters. (Applause.) Let's applaud them. Let's applaud them. Let's applaud them. (Applause.)
So, Philly, we have nine days — nine days to get this done. And for the next nine days, no one can sit on the sidelines.
AUDIENCE: No!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: There is too much on the line, and we must not wake up the day after the election and have any regrets about what we could have done in these next nine days. So, let's spend these next nine days knowing we did everything we could; that we connected with each other, with our neighbors; that we went up to perfect strangers in the grocery store and said, ""You know what? I see you.""
Let's — let's approach this moment in a way that in the face of a stranger, we see a neighbor. And let's talk with each other about what we have in common. (Applause.) Let's build community. And let's knock on doors. Let's text and call potential voters. (Applause.) Let's reach out to our family and our friends and our classmates and our neighbors. (Applause.) Tell them about the stakes in this election, and tell them about their power.
So, we are going to get folks to the polls, and we are going to make our voices heard. (Applause.)
And let's give folks some important information. Election Day — we — let's start with the basics. (Laughter.) Okay?
Election Day is Tuesday, November 5th. (Laughter and applause.) I'm serious. Everybody is busy. Let's start with that.
Let folks know you can vote then or you can vote early from today through Tuesday, October 29th. That's two days from now. So, now is the time to vote early. Get it done tomorrow if you can. Go to IWillVote.com if you need information about where you vote.
And if you have received your ballot in the mail, do not wait. Fill it out today. (Applause.) Because the election is here, and the choice, Philly, is truly in your hands. The path to victory runs right through all the leaders who are here — (applause) — who — all of you. And your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power.
So, today, Philadelphia, I ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. God bless the United States of America. God bless you. (Applause.) Thank you all.

    Vice President of the United States: 2021-2025
  
  

  
    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Ann Arbor, Michigan
  


  

  
    October 28, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good evening, Ann Arbor! (Applause.) Good evening.
Can we hear it for Tim Walz? (Applause.)
Oh, it's great to be back in Michigan. How's everybody doing? (Applause.) Go Blue! (Applause.)
So, let me just say about Tim Walz. He's been such an extraordinary running mate, and he will be an extraordinary vice president of the United States. (Applause.)
And let me tell you why I love Coach Walz. As he travels to every corner of our country, meeting with people in small towns, big to- — towns, everywhere in between, Cal- — Coach Walz is always bringing the joy. He is always bringing the joy. He cares about people. He understands people. He understands hard work. And he understands what it means to be a leader who lifts people up instead of trying to beat people down. That is Tim Walz. (Applause.)
And, Ann Arbor, I can feel the joy tonight. Thank you all so very much. (Applause.)
And we have some other incredible leaders with us here tonight. Mayor Taylor, thank you. (Applause.) Where's — there you are. Deputy County Executive Turfe, I thank you so very much. (Applause.) Lieutenant Governor Gilchrist. (Applause.) Representative Dingell, a champion for this community. (Applause.) And let's also send Elissa Slotkin to the United States Senate. (Applause.) We need her in D.C.
And I also want to thank all the labor, elected, and community leaders who are here today.
And can we please hear it again for Maggie Rogers? (Applause.)
All right. We got business to handle. (Laughter.)
Okay. So, Ann Arbor, I have a question for you. Are we ready to do this? (Applause.)
Are we ready to vote? (Applause.)
Are we ready to win? (Applause.) Yes. And we will win. (Applause.) And we will win.
So, you just heard from the coach: Early voting has started here in Michigan. You can vote early now through Sunday, November 3rd. And we need you to vote early, Michigan, because we have just eight days to go — eight days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime.
And as everybody here knows, this is going to be a tight race until the very end.
So, we have a lot of work ahead of us, but we like hard work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work.
And make no mistake, we will win. We will win. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes, we will.
And we will win because together —
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we will win, yes. Yes. (Laughs.)
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We can keep going all night. (Laughs.)
But one of the reasons we will win is because we are all in this together. We are all in this together — people from every walk of life, understanding that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.
And we here are fighting for the future. (Applause.) We are fighting for the future, and we understand the opportunity that we have before us to turn the page on the fear and divisiveness that have characterized our politics for a decade because of Donald Trump.
We have an opportunity to turn the page and chart a new and joyful way forward where we tap into the ambitions — (applause) — and we will tap into the ambitions and the aspirations and the dreams of the American people. (Applause.)
And let me tell you something. As I travel our country, there is an overwhelming call for a fresh start — people from all walks of life. And they are calling for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic and excited about what we can do together. (Applause.)
There is a yearning in our country for a president who will see you, who gets you, and who will fight for you. (Applause.)
And, listen, hey, on the subject of Gaza. Hey, guys — (the vice president waves to audience members) — I hear you. On the subject of Gaza, we all want this war to end as soon as possible and get the hostages out. And I will do everything in my power to make it so. (Applause.)
And let's be clear. We are all here because we are fighting for a democracy and for the right of people to be heard and seen. (Applause.) We're not about the enemy within. We know we are all in this together. That's what we are fighting for. (Applause.)
And my whole career —
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay, now I want each of you to shout your own name. Do that — (laughter) — because it's about all of us. It's about all of us.
And, listen, I have fought my whole career to put the people first and to put the people above partisanship. I never once asked in my career, ""Are you a Democrat or are you a Republican?"" The only thing I ever asked is ""How can I help you? Are you okay?"" And that — (applause) — and that is a major difference between Donald Trump and me, and between the two extremely different visions that he and I have for our nation.
His is focused on himself and the past. Ours is focused on the future and it is focused on the people. (Applause.)
So, together, we will build a future where we bring down the cost of living. That will be my focus every single day as president, because while inflation is down and wages are up, prices are still too high. You know it, and I know it.
And unlike Donald Trump, who had $400 million handed to him on a silver platter — and don't forget, he filed for bankruptcy six times, the great businessman — unlike him, I grew up in a middle-class neighborhood with a working mother who kept a strict budget and did everything she could to make sure that my sister and I had all we needed. I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. (Applause.) Never.
And so, my commonsense plan will lower the prices you pay on everything from prescription medication to groceries to housing. On the other hand, Donald Trump will raise costs on you and your family.
In fact, independent economists have analyzed both of our plans and found mine will cut your costs and strengthen our economy, while his will increase inflation and lead to a recession by the middle of next year. (Applause.)
And his agenda is laid out in Project 2025. You know, I say everywhere —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I know we've got a lot of students here, and I have to tell you, I just find it really interesting that they put that — that thing in writing. (Laughter.) They put it in writing. They — they bound it. They published it. They handed it out. And then they expect we're not going to talk about it? Are you kidding me? (Laughter.)
And when you read it, you will see it is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he plans to do if he is elected president.
Donald Trump will impose a 20 percent national sales tax on everyday, basic necessities, which economists have estimated will cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Contrast, on the other hand, I'm going to take on corporate price gouging. I've done it before, and I will do it again. (Applause.)
Donald Trump will give massive tax cuts, like he did before, to billionaires and the biggest corporations. He did it the last time. He is going to do it again.
I, on the other hand, will give middle-class tax cuts to hundred million Americans, including $6,000 for the first year of a child's life, because I understand how that will lift America's children out of poverty, which what — must be one of our highest goals. (Applause.)
Donald Trump will get rid of the $35-a-month cap on insulin for our seniors.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He will cut Medicare and Social Security. In fact, economists say he will bankrupt Social Security in the next six years.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And understand what that means. So many of the seniors in America — that's their only source of income. That's the only way they're able to pay their rent and buy food.
I have a plan to support our seniors, so they can grow older with dignity and so their families are not overwhelmed by the cost of home health care. (Applause.)
On top of that, my plan will bring down the cost of housing; cut taxes for small businesses, because small businesses are the backbone of our economy — (applause); and lower health care costs, because I believe health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. (Applause.)
Donald Trump, on the other hand, intends to end the Affordable Care Act and take us back —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — which would take us back to a time when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was like?
Well, we are —
AUDIENCE: Not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We're not going — and we're not going back because we, together, will move forward to the future, because we believe in who we are and what is possible and because we know it is time to turn the page. It is time to turn the page. (Applause.)
Ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom, like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body — (applause) — and not have her government tell her what to do.
And we all remember how we got here. When Donald Trump was president, he hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And they did as he intended. And now in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest.
I was just in Texas the other day. You know they provide prison for life for doctors and nurses and health care providers for providing care? Prison for life.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And no exceptions for a crime that is a violation of someone's body, and then to tell that survivor of that violation, ""You have no right to make a decision about what happens to your body next."" That is immoral. It is immoral. (Applause.) And I know we all agree: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do. (Applause.) Not the government.
And, listen, you all have heard me say, I do believe Donald Trump to be an unserious man, but the consequences of him ever being president again are brutally serious — brutally serious. Consider, on the topic we were just discussing, Donald Trump still refuses to acknowledge the pain and suffering he has caused. He insists that, quote, ""everyone"" wanted for Roe v. Wade to be overturned.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Everyone wanted this? Women are being denied care during miscarriages, some only being treated when they've developed sepsis. They didn't want this. Couples trying to grow their family have been cut off in the middle of IVF treatments. They didn't want this. The men of America are seeing their daughters and wives and sisters and mothers put at risk because their rights have been taken from them. The men of America don't want this. (Applause.)
And women have died because of these bans. How could anyone say these folks wanted this?
And I pledge to you, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedoms, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly. Proudly.
And I'm traveling our nation. So, I have to tell everyone here: Across our nation, we are seeing a full-on assault on other and additional hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote.
I was just in Georgia. You know they passed a law that makes it illegal to give people food and water for standing in line to vote?
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: The hypocrisy abounds. Whatever happened to ""love thy neighbor,"" right?
Attacks on the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.)
So, I say to everyone here what you know: Generations of Americans before us fought for freedom, and now the baton is in our hands. The baton is in our hands. And I want to speak specifically to all the young leaders, all the students who are here today. (Applause.) I want to speak to you for a moment.
So, I love your generation. (Laughs.) I really do. And one of the things about it is you are rightly impatient for change. I love that about you. (Applause.)
You are impatient for change. Because, look, you have only known the climate crisis and are leading, then, the charge to protect our planet and our future. (Applause.) You — you, young leaders, who grew up with active shooter drills and are fighting, then, to keep our schools safe. You, who now know fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers, are standing up for reproductive freedom. (Applause.)
And for you — and for you, then, I know that these issues that are at stake, they are not theoretical. This is not political for you. It is your lived experience. And I see you, and I see your power, and I know many of you are voting for the first time. Can I see a raise of hands: Who's voting for the first time? (Applause.)
Can we hear it for our first-time voters? (Applause.) See, that's why I know the future of our country is bright. That's why I know.
So, listen, so much is on the line in this election, and this is not 2016 or 2020. We can all see that Donald Trump is even more unstable and more unhinged, and now he wants unchecked power.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And this time — and this time, there will be no one there to stop him, not even the Supreme Court, which, months ago, told the former president that he is essentially immune no matter what he would do in the White House.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, think about it. Before, at least there was the threat, the possibility that there would be some accountability and consequence. Now the Supreme Court has said he is effectively — would be immune.
So, just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. He who has vowed he would be a dictator on day one. He who has even called for, quote, the ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States of America.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And let us be clear. Anyone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States of America. (Applause.) Never again. Never again.
AUDIENCE: Never again! Never again! Never again!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Never again. (Inaudible.)
AUDIENCE: Never again! Never again! Never again!
So, Michigan, there is a huge contrast in this election, and I'd ask us to just imagine the Oval Office in three months. Okay? So, just picture it in your head. So, either it's Donald Trump sitting in there —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — stewing — stewing over his enemies list — or me, with your help, working for you, checking off my to-do list. (Applause.)
So, Michigan, it all comes down to this. We are here together because we know what is at stake. Everyone here, out of your busy lives, the time you have taken to be here tonight and to be here because we know not only what is at stake but we are here together because we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country. We love our country.
And, you know, when you love something, you got to fight for it. (Applause.) Ours is not a fight against something. Ours is not a fight against something. It is a fight for something. (Applause.)
And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism — love of our country — to then fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. That's what our campaign is about. That's what we are about.
And one of the most powerful ways that we will do that is with our vote. So, now is the time to get out the vote, Michigan. (Applause.) Now is the time.
AUDIENCE: Vote! Vote! Vote!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we have eight days to get this done. So, obviously, nobody here is going to sit on the sidelines.
AUDIENCE: No!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And let's make sure that we spend the next eight days knowing that in nine days, when we look back, we will be able to say and know we did everything we could to remind our friends and our classmates and our neighbors and our coworkers that we're all in this together.
You know, there's been something about this Trump era that has been very backward in terms of trying to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down, instead of what we all know: The true measure of our individual and collective strength is based on who we lift up. (Applause.) That's what we are about.
And over these next eight days, yes, we will win. Yes, we must win. But let's also approach these eight da- — eight days knowing our power to build community, knowing our power to build coalitions, knowing our power to reach out to one another, reminding us that nobody is alone, that we are all in this together.
And let's do that then — (applause) — while we knock on doors, while we take the time to text and call potential voters. Let's reach out to our family and our friends and our classmates and our neighbors and make sure they know the stakes in this election.
And let's remind them: Your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. (Applause.)
And so, Michigan, I then ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.
Thank you all. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Warren, Michigan
  


  

  
    October 28, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you all.
PARTICIPANT: Thank you for saving our pensions. Thank you for saving — (applause) —
PARTICIPANTS: Thank you.
PARTICIPANT: Thank you. Thank you for CHIPS and Science. Thank you for the Inflation Reduction Act. Thank you for all you've done for us.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, you know what? Y- — you guys make it easy. I mean, look, I — as you know, I am a long-standing supporter and friend of unions and labor. And — and the painters union, I am honored to have your support in this election.
But, look, you guys are the ones who make it easy. This is highly skilled work. You do it with a sense of pride. You do it with a sense of commitment. You are making our country stronger and better by the work that you do.
We just talked about the industrial work that you're doing, whether it's about a bridge, whether it's about what we're doing to invest in technology and the future industries. You're transitioning also into batteries — all that work. And it's highly skilled work.
And I love, for example, the apprenticeship programs and building up America's workforce around training and, again, the highest of skills. The work that you are doing through an apprenticeship program that's also about building community and family for the people who enter it — it's about pride in work. It's about the dignity of work.
The reason that I have fought for things like pensions is it's literally about the dignity of work. You work hard. You deserve, at the point that you're going to retire, to be able to retire with dignity. And we have to value the skill.
You know, my opponent, he doesn't understand the importance of unions at all. No, but he's — he just gives a lot of mouth. He —
PARTICIPANT: He's got to care about people to understand them.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He gives a lot of talk about what he cares about, but on the issue specifically of what is good for unions and union labor, he's been awful. You look at what he did when he was at — president with the NLRB, the National Labor Relations Board — a bunch of union busters.
You look at — when he talked to his buddies, like his billionaire buddies — remember, he did the tax cut for billionaires and big corporations. He's not workin- — he's not working for or concerned about working people, middle-class people. And then when he's talking to his buddy, he li- — he jokes about, ""Yeah, if they're striking, you should fire them.""
But what I know America understands about union labor is it's just about fairness and it is about dignity. Wherever I go, I tell people: Look, if you've got a five-day workweek, if you've got sick time, if you've got vacation time, if you have a pension, thank a union member. Thank unions. Because whether somebody's a member of a union or not, union labor and hard work is a — so much of what fought for workers' rights across the board.
So, look, I'm here. I'm here for you. We have an election coming up in eight days.
PARTICIPANT: That you're going to win. (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we are going — we are going to win. You know what? We are going to win.
We may have bloody knuckles by the end of it, but we're winning. We're winning.
And — and because we stand for certain basic principles, and we know — we know when we know what we stand for, we know what to fight for.
PARTICIPANT: You're here. He's not.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. Right. It's —
PARTICIPANT: Save our country from him.
PARTICIPANT: Please.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm — and you're right. I mean, you look at — you look at how he just deg- — he — he talks down to the American people. He — he degrades who we are as America, in- — instead of fighting for who we are in terms of our capacity.
I look at our young leaders. They deserve to have a leader and a president of the United States who is not only optimistic but ambitious about what we can do. Donald Trump just recently talked about how he would get rid of CHIPS — the number of jobs for the painters union members, building trades members, writ large; what we did with the Inflation Reduction Act, the jobs we've created there; the work that we've done that's been about partnering with the private sector to create incentives for them to put the money into it and also prioritizing, as I always will, letting them know, ""As we create these jobs, put them through your apprenticeship programs. Let's make those union jobs and good-paying jobs.""
All of that is at stake, but it's a — it's also about an approach and a value in character. And right now, you know, I've been saying: Look, imagine January 20th, because there will be — one of us is going to be elected, and one of us is going to be sitting in the Oval Office on January 20th.
And it's a choice on many levels, including whether you want Donald Trump sitting in the Oval Office, stewing over his enemies list —
PARTICIPANT: No, no, no, no, no.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — or what we're going to do together, which is there, focused on American workers and American families, on our to-do list.
So, we got a lot at stake. We are going to win. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Hemlock, Michigan
  


  

  
    October 28, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Oh, please have a seat, everyone. Thank you.
Listen, I came by to say thank you, in particular to you all and the folks who are doing this work here.
A.B., Wendell, I want to thank you. And the — Congressman Kildee, you've been an extraordinary partner for us in Washington, D.C.
Mayor, I thank you for the warm welcome.
But I'm so excited about the work you all are doing here. This really does represent the best of who we are as a country.
You know, I think that when we understand who we are as a nation, we take great pride in being a leader on so many things, and we have a tradition of that.
But I think what we know as Americans is that we cannot rest on tradition. We have to constantly be on top of what is happening, what is current, and investing in the industries of the future as well as honoring the traditions and the industries that have built up America's economy.
And what you all are doing here is exactly that.
First of all, we talked about the fact that the people who are doing this extraordinary work here, the workers here, you're doing work that requires an incredibly high level of skill. As I listen to it, it's about engineering. There's a technology piece to this. There is a chemistry piece to this. There is math to this. And, I mean, it's — it's just — I mean, you're doing robots, for God's sake. (Laughter.) It's good stuff.
And the fact that it's right here and not very far from where you grew up and where you live. And if we're really going to strengthen America, we got to understand that we can do many things at once. We can invest in industries of the future while also knowing, look, folks don't want to have to leave home to have a good-paying job. And that job should be well enough paying that you are able to buy a home and to raise a family.
And what you guys are doing right here on the ground exemplifies all of that.
I was talking with Wendell and A.B. about the fact that what you are doing here on the ground makes real that investing in American industries and investing in American workers can happen at the same time. There doesn't have to be a tension between the two.
That doing this work will also be about understanding, look, we got to win the competition for the 21st century. We're not going to have China beat us in the competition for the 21st century.
And that's about, then, doing the work that Corning is going to be doing about manufacturing of those solar panels, together with the work that you are doing here. What is it, polysilicone?
AUDIENCE: Polysilicon.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Si- — silicon. I'm sorry. (Laughter.) That wasn't right.
Right? But doing the work here that is about — you're — you're creating the raw materials that these robots are then shipping out to other American-based manufacturers.
You're doing the work that's about building up a clean energy economy and a guess — and again, investing in workers. Wendell told me you're going to be hiring 1,300 new workers starting today — good-paying jobs; $89,000 a year, I understand, at least. My staff said, ""Yeah, that's better than some of the White House jobs,"" in terms of how much it pays. (Laughter.) I said, ""Look, it's important work.""
And you're doing it in a way that also makes us so proud as a country.
And so, I came by, first and foremost, to thank you all. And as I said to many of you as we were on this tour, I'm going to be talking about you behind your back. (Laughter.) I am. I'm going to be talking about the fact that this is what we can do.
And I say this as a very proud, long-standing — my whole entire life working — I've always been a public servant. I believe in the important and good work that government can do.
I also know the limitations of government. And when we can find a way to have meaningful partnerships with the private sector, with industries, to do the kind of work that is happening here, everybody wins. Everybody wins.
And so, I want to thank you all for what you're doing here as a great example of what was a vision that we had — the president and I and the congressman. We're going to create a meaningful public investment in America's private industries through the Chips Act, through the Inflation Reduction Act. And we're going to infuse it with billions of dollars, knowing that if we do that, as that old saying comes, ""If you build it, they will come.""
And that's when you all stepped in, A.B. and Wendell, and created a facility like this and what's happening across the way that's going to be about hiring folks, who, by the way, are doing highly skilled work that are good-paying jobs that don't require a college degree.
And that's another point of emphasis that bears repeating. I believe that as we think of industries of the future and the future of America's workforce, we need to get in front of this idea that the only high-skilled jobs are — require a college degree. It's just not true.
And, in fact, when I become president of the United States, one of the things that I plan on doing immediately — people ask me, ""What are you doing on day one?"" — one of the things immediately is to reassess federal jobs — and I've already started looking at it — to look at which ones don't require a college degree.
Because here's the thing. That's not the only qualification for a qualified worker. You've got to look at the skills; you've got to look at the experience.
And, again, you all are making that real and showing that on the ground right here.
So, there are many points that are about how do we think about the future of work, the future of the workforce, the future of American industry in a way that understands that we should be optimistic about what's possible.
And look, we are eight days out from an election. So, I just got to also talk about the contrast, because my opponent spends full time talking about — just kind of diminishing who we are as America and talking down at people, talking about — I don't know, that we're the ""garbage can of the world."" We're not.
He just recently did a radio talk show and talked about how he'd get rid of the CHIPS Act. That's — that was billions of dollars investing in just the kind of work that's happening here.
And you know how we did it? We created tax credits to create the incentive for the private sector to do this work. That's good work.
When he was president, he sold advanced chips to China that helped them with their agenda to modernize their military. That's not about what's in the best interest of America's security and prosperity, which should be two of the highest priorities for president of the United States.
So, I say all that to say that there is a choice that the American public — a very serious choice presented in the next eight days. And as much as anything, it is a question about what is the direction in the future that we want for our country.
And I will refer to what you all are doing here to tell you that you are a source of my optimism and also my ambition about what we are capable of when we are focused on our capacity and we are focused on the future in such a meaningful way.
And so, I want to thank everybody for what you are doing. And, like I said, I'll be talking about you. (Laughter.)
But thank you for your good work, everyone, and thank you for the time. Take care. (Applause.)

    Vice President of the United States: 2021-2025
  
  

  
    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event on The Ellipse
  


  

  
    October 29, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good evening, America! (Applause.) Good evening, everyone. Good evening. And thank you for taking the time out of your busy lives.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everyone.
So, listen, one week from today, you will have the chance to make a decision that directly impacts your life, the life of your family, and the future of this country we love. (Applause.) And it will probably be the most important vote you ever cast.
And this election is more than just a choice between two parties and two different candidates. It is a choice about whether we have a country rooted in freedom for every American or ruled by chaos and division. (Applause.)
Many of you watching have probably already cast your ballots — (applause) — but I know many others are still considering who to vote for or whether you'll vote at all. So, tonight, I will speak to everyone about the choice and the stakes in this election.
Look, we know who Donald Trump is. He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: An election that he knew he lost. Americans died as a result of that attack. One hundred and forty law enforcement officers were injured because of that attack.
And while Donald Trump sat in the White House watching as the violence unfolded on television, he was told by his staff that the mob wanted to kill his own vice president, and Donald Trump responded with two words, ""So what?""
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: America, that's who Donald Trump is, and that's who is asking you to give him another four years in the Oval Office —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — not to focus on your problems, but to focus on his.
And Donald Trump has told us his priorities for a second term. He has an enemies list of people he intends to prosecute. He says that one of his highest priorities is to set free the violent extremists who insaulted [assaulted] those law enforcement officers on January 6th.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Donald Trump intends to use the United States military against American citizens who simply disagree with him —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — people he calls, quote, ""the enemy from within.""
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: America, this is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power. Donald Trump has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other. That is who he is.
But, America, I am here tonight to say that is not who we are. (Applause.) That is not who we are. That is not who we are.
You see, what Donald Trump has never understood is that e pluribus unum — ""out of many, one"" — isn't just a phrase on a dollar bill. It is a living truth about the heart of our nation.
Our democracy doesn't — it doesn't ac- — require us to agree on everything. In fact, we like good arguments from time to time. Just think of your own family, right?
It's not the American way to not have disagreements. We don't shy away from robest debate — robust debate. In fact, we like a good debate, don't we? We like a good debate. (Applause.)
And the fact that someone disagrees with us does not make them the ""enemy within."" (Applause.) They are family, neighbors, classmates, coworkers. They are fellow Americans, and as Americans, we rise and fall together. (Applause.)
America, for too long, we have been consumed with too much division, chaos, and mutual distrust. And it can be easy then to forget a simple truth: It doesn't have to be this way. (Applause.) It doesn't have to be this way.
It is time to stop pointing figers [fingers] — we have to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms. It is time to turn the page on the drama and the conflict, the fear and division. It is time for a new generation of leadership in America. (Applause.) And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States of America. (Applause.)
Now, look, let me say — let me say, I recognize this has not been a typical campaign. (Laughter.) Even though I've had the honor of serving as your vice president for the last four years, I know — (applause) — but I know that many of you are still getting to know who I am.
Well, let me tell you. I am someone who has spent most of my career outside of Washington, D.C., so I know that not all the good ideas come from here. I am not afraid of tough fights against bad actors and powerful interests — (applause) — because, for decades, as a prosecutor and a top law enforcement officer of our biggest state, I won fights against big banks that ripped off homeowners, against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students, against predators who abused women and children, and cartels that trafficked in guns, drugs, and human beings.
And I did this work because, for as long as I can remember, I have always had an instinct to protect. There's something about people being treated unfairly or overlooked that, frankly, just gets to me. I don't like it. It's what my mother instilled in me: a drive to hold accountable those who use their wealth or power to take advantage of other people, the drive to protect hardworking Americans who aren't always seen or heard and deserve a voice. And I will tell you that is the kind of president I will be. (Applause.)
And, look, I'll be honest with you, I'm not perfect. I make mistakes. But here's what I promise you: I will always listen to you, even — (applause) — even if you don't vote for me. I will always tell you the truth, even if it is difficult to hear. I will work every day to build consensus and reach compromise to get things done. (Applause.) And if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way. (Applause.)
So, look, in less than 90 days, either Donald Trump or I will be in the Oval Office. Okay? (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: On day one — on day one —
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on day one, if elected — on day one, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list — (applause) — full of priorities of what I will get done for the American people.
And I will work with everyone — Democrats, Republicans, and independents — to help Americans who are working hard and still struggling to get ahead.
I have been honored to serve as Joe Biden's vice president — (applause) — but I will bring my own experiences and ideas to the Oval Office. My presidency will be different, because the challenges we face are different.
Our top priority as a nation four years ago was to end the pandemic and rescue the economy. Now our biggest challenge is to lower costs — costs that were rising even before the pandemic and that are still too high.
I get it. I still remember our mother sitting at that yellow Formica table late at night, cup of tea in hand, a pile of bills in front of her trying to make it all work. And I've heard from so many of you who are facing even greater financial pressures.
Donald Trump's answer to you is the same as it was the last time: another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And this time, he will pay for it with a 20 percent national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Think about it: clothes, food, toys, cell phones. A Trump sales tax that would cost the average family nearly $4,000 more a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on top of that, you will pay even more if Donald Trump finally gets his way and repeals the Affordable Care Act —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — which would throw millions of Americans off their health insurance and take us back to when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, we are not going back. (Applause.) We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are not going back, because we also know Donald Trump would deliver tax cuts to his billionaire donors. I will deliver tax cuts to working people and the middle class. (Applause.)
I will make sure you have a chance not just to get by, but to get ahead — (applause) — because I believe in honoring the dignity of work. (Applause.)
I will enact the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on groceries — (applause); cap the price of insulin; and limit out-of-pocket prescription costs for all Americans. (Applause.)
I will fight to make sure that hardworking Americans can actually afford a place to live. (Applause.) I'll never forget how our mother saved up and how excited she was when she could finally afford to buy our first home. I remember how excited she was. And I know that owning a home is not only a measure of financial security, it's about the pride of your hard work.
And, as president, I will fight to help first-time homebuyers with your down payment, take on the companies that are jacking up rents, and build millions of new homes. (Applause.)
For years, we have heard excuses about why America can't build enough housing. Enough with the excuses. I'm going to cut the red tape and work with the private sector and local governments to speed up building and get it done. (Applause.)
And the cost of housing isn't the only financial pressure on middle-class families. I have met so many young people who have a natural desire to parent their children well but not always the resources to do it. So, I'll fight for a Child Tax Credit to save them some money — (applause) — which — which will also lift American children out of poverty. (Applause.)
I'll work to lower the cost of childcare, which is out of reach for too many working families today.
And for too many people in the sandwich generation, who are raising young children and taking care of a parent, juggling all of it is extremely difficult.
You know, I took care of my mother when she got sick — cooking fodes [foods] that — food that she had a taste for, finding clothes that would not irritate her skin. And understand, as I do, that caregiving is about dignity. It is about dignity. (Applause.)
And currently, if you need home care and you don't have some money to hire someone, you and your family need to deplete your savings to qualify for help. That's just not right.
So, we're going to change the approach and allow Medicare to cover the cost of home care — (applause) — so seniors can get the help and care they need in their own homes. (Applause.)
Now, Donald Trump has a different approach. He tried to cut Medicare and Social Security every year he was president.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Look, I believe that when people have worked hard their entire life, they deserve to retire with the benefits they have earned. (Applause.)
And I believe in the fundamental freedom of Americans to make decisions about their own bodies and not have their government tell them what to do. (Applause.)
I will fight to restore what Donald Trump and his hand-selected Supreme Court justices took away from the women of America. (Applause.) That today one in three women in America — think about it — one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: The idea that a woman who survives a crime of a violation to her body should not have the authority to make a decision about what happens to her body next — that is immoral. That is immoral.
And Trump is not done. He would ban abortion nationwide, restrict access to birth control, and put IVF treatments at risk and force states to monitor women's pregnancies.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Just google Project 2025 and read the plans for yourself.
And, look, I think we all know one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to simply agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body. (Applause.) Not the government.
And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly.
And, look, on another subject, politicians have got to stop treating immigration as an issue to scare up votes in an election — (applause) — and instead treat it as the serious challenge that it is that we must finally come together to solve.
I will work with Democrats and Republicans to sign into law the border security bill that Donald Trump killed. (Applause.)
When I was attorney general of a border state, I saw the chaos and violence caused by transnational criminal organizations that I took on. And when I am president, we will quickly remove those who arrive here unlawfully, prosecute the cartels, and give Border Patrol the support they so desperately need. (Applause.)
At the same time, we must acknowledge we are a nation of immigrants. (Applause.) And I will work with Congress to pass immigration reform, including an earned path to citizenship for hardworking immigrants like farmworkers and our DREAMers. (Applause.)
As commander in chief, I will make sure America has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world. (Applause.) Donald Trump, on the other hand, has shown his contempt for our nation's heroes, calls them ""suckers"" and ""losers"" —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — called a four-star Marine general, a, quote, ""lowlife.""
I will always honor, never denigrate, the service and sacrifice of our troops and their families and fulfill our sacred obligation to care for them.
I will strengthen, not surrender, America's global leadership. (Applause.) And I will stand with our friends, because I know that our alliances keep American people safe and make America stronger and more secure. (Applause.)
Look, world leaders think that Donald Trump is an easy mark, easy to manipulate with flattery or favor. And you can believe that autocrats like Putin and Kim Jong Un are rooting for him in this election.
I will always uphold our security, advance our national interest, and ensure that the United States of America remains, as we must forever be, a champion of liberty around the world. (Applause.)
America, we know what Donald Trump has in mind: more chaos, more division, and policies that help those at the very top and hurt everyone else. I offer a different path, and I ask for your vote. (Applause.)
And here is my pledge to you. I pledge to seek common ground and commonsense solutions to make your life better. I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. I pledge to listen to experts, to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make, and to people who disagree with me. Unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. (Applause.)
I pledge to you to approach my work with the joy and optimism that comes from making a difference in people's lives, and I pledge to be a president for all Americans — (applause) — and to always put country above party and self. (Applause.)
I love our country with all my heart — (applause) — and I believe in its promise, because I've lived it. I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents would take me to marches in a stroller, where crowds of people of all races, faiths, and walks of life came together to fight for the ideals of freedom and opportunity.
I've lived the promise of America. I saw how hard our mother worked to give her daughters the same chances this country gave her. Growing up, I was blessed to have family by blood and family by love, who instilled in me the values of community, compassion, and faith that have always defined our nation at its best.
I've lived the promise of America. I've spent my life fighting for the people who have been hurt and counted out but never stopped believing that in our country, anything is possible.
I've lived the promise of America, and I see the promise of America in all of you. In all of you, I see it. (Applause.)
I see it in the young people who are voting for the first time — (applause) — who are determined to live free from gun violence and to protect our planet and to shape the world they inherit. (Applause.)
I see it in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom — (applause) — and the men who support them. (Applause.)
I see it in Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before — (applause) — but have put the Constitution of the United States over party. (Applause.)
I've seen it in Americans, different in many respects, but united in our pursuit of freedom, our belief in fairness and decency, and our faith in a better future.
America, I know the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. I know it. And that's why I am in this race: to fight for the people, just like I always have. (Applause.)
Nearly 250 years ago, America was born when we wrested freedom from a petty tyrant. Across the generations, Americans have preserved that freedom, expanded it, and, in so doing, proved to the world that a government of, by, and for the people is strong and can endure. (Applause.)
And those who came before us — the patriots at Normandy and Selma, Seneca Falls and Stonewall, on farmlands and factory floors — they did not struggle, sacrifice, and lay down their lives only to see us cede our fundamental freedoms. (Applause.)
They didn't do that only to see us submit to the will of another petty tyrant. (Applause.)
These United States of America, we are not a vessel for the schemes of wannabe dictators. (Applause.)
The United States of America is the greatest idea humanity ever devised — a nation big enough to encompass all our dreams, strong enough to withstand any fracture or fissure between us, and fearless enough to imagine a future of possibilities.
So, America, let us reach for that future. Let us fight for this beautiful country we love. And in seven days, we have the power — each of you has the power to turn the page and start writing the next chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told.
I thank you all. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)
Thank you. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Madison, Wisconsin
  


  

  
    October 30, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Wisconsin! (Applause.) Hello, Wisconsin! (Applause.) Oh.
Let's hear it for Ty. (Applause.)
All right, Madison, are we ready to do this? (Applause.)
Are we ready to vote? (Applause.)
Are we ready to win? (Applause.)
Oh, it's good to be back in Madison. It's good to be
back. (Applause.)
And many of you may know, when I was five years old, my parents taught at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. (Applause.) And so, for a time, my sister, Maya, and I lived not far from here in a house on Lake Mendota.
So, it's good to be back. And it is good to be with so many incredible leaders. And I, first of all, want to thank everybody who is here right now for taking the time you have taken to be here.
I also want to thank our governor of Wisconsin, Evers — Governor Evers. (Applause.) Thank you always. Every time I land, he says, ""Welcome home.""
Senator Baldwin — (applause) — a champion for working families; Representative Pocan — (applause); Mayor Rhodes-Conway — (applause); Mandela Barnes. (Applause.)
And can we hear for our amazing musicians: Gracie Abrams — (applause); Remi Wolf — (applause); The National — (applause); and Mumford & Sons. (Applause.)
All right. So, Madison, early voting has started. Here in Madison, you can vote early now through Sunday, November 3rd. And we need you to vote early, Wisconsin, because — (applause) — we have six days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime.
And we have work to do, but we like hard work. (Applause.) Hard work — hard work is good work. (Applause.) Hard work is joyful work. (Applause.)
And make no mistake, we will win. (Applause.) We will win. We will win. Yes, we will. We will win. We will win.
And I will tell you, we will win — we will win because when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. (Applause.) And we know we have an opportunity in —
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Ceasefire now! Ceasefire now! Ceasefire now!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hey, you know what? Listen. We all want the war in Gaza to end and get the hostages out as soon as possible. (Applause.) And I will do everything in my power to make it heard and known.
But — and everyone has a right to be heard, but right now I am speaking. (Applause.) Thank you.
So, Madison, we have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. That is who he is, but, Madison, that is not who we are. (Applause.)
And folks are exhausted and want it to stop — the pointing fingers. It is time that we start locking arms together as a people who rise and fall together. (Applause.)
And it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. (Applause.) And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States. (Applause.)
And, Wisconsin, you know me. I'm not afraid of tough fights. For decades, as a prosecutor and a top law enforcement officer of our biggest state, I won fights. (Applause.) I won fights against the big banks that ripped off homeowners, against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students, against predators who abused women and children, against cartels that trafficked in guns and drugs and human beings.
And, Wisconsin, if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way of fighting for you. (Applause.)
And here is the thing — and here is the thing: We know who Donald Trump is. This is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed — obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power. (Applause.) And in less than 90 days, it's either going to be him or me in the Oval Office. (Applause.)
And here's what — here's what you know, and it's — here's what we know: If he is elected — it's not going to happen. But if he were elected, on day one, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. You know, he talks about the ""enemies from within."" When I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list focused on your needs. (Applause.)
And at the top — and at the top of my list is bringing down your cost of living. (Applause.) That will be my focus every single day as president. I will give a middle-class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. (Applause.)
We will enact the first-ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries. (Applause.)
We will fight to make sure hardworking Americans can actually afford a place to live. (Applause.)
And if any of you out there are caring for an elderly parent, well, my plan will cover the cost of home care under Medicare — (applause) — so that seniors can get the help and care they need to stay in their own homes. (Applause.) It's about dignity. It's about dignity.
And my plan will lower the cost of childcare, cut taxes for small businesses. Do we have any small-business owners here? (Applause.) I love our small businesses.
My plan will lower health care costs, because, by the way, I believe access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. (Applause.)
It's about values. It's about values.
On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face, well, it's the same as it was last time: another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. Right.
And this time, he will pay for it with a 20 percent national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported: clothes, food, toys, cell phones. A Trump sales tax would cost the average American family nearly $4,000 more a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on top of that, you would pay even more if Donald Trump finally gets his way and gets rid of the Affordable Care Act. Remember how many times he's tried to do that?
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And you're booing, because if he were successful, it would throw millions of Americans off of their health insurance and take us back to when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was like?
Well, we are —
AUDIENCE: Not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — not going back. We're not
(inaudible). (Applause.) We're not going back.
Just like Wisconsin's state motto tells us, we will move forward. (Applause.)
Because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom — (applause) — freedom — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not
have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
And we all remember how we got here. When Donald Trump was president, he hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. They did as he intended. And now, in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Immoral.
And look, Donald Trump is not done. He would ban abortion nationwide. Yes, even here in Wisconsin. And he would restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states — listen to this — force states to monitor women's pregnancies. Just google Project 2025.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Read the plans yourself.
And I know we all here know, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn't be telling her what to do with her body. (Applause.) Not the government. Not the government. Not the government.
And when Congress — together with Tammy's help, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly sign it into law.
So, Wisconsin, I am asking for your vote. (Applause.) And here is my pledge to you. As president, I pledge to seek common ground and commonsense solutions to the challenges you face. I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. And I pledge — (applause) — because I know we can — because I know we can — I know we can make progress.
And I pledge, then, to listen to experts, to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make, and to people who disagree with me. Because, look, unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at my table. (Applause.)
And I pledge to always put country above party and self and to be a president for all Americans. (Applause.)
So, it all comes down to this. We are here together for many reasons. But one of the most important: We are here together because we love our country. We love our country. (Applause.) We love our country, and when you love something, you fight for it. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And — and I do believe that one of the highest forms of patriotism — of our expression for the love of our country is to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it.
I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents would take me to the marches when I was in a stroller, where people from every walk of life came together to fight for freedom and for opportunity.
Growing up, I saw how hard my mother worked to give her daughters the same chances our country gave her. And I was blessed — (applause) — and I was blessed to have family by blood and family by love — (applause) — who instilled in me the values of community and compassion and faith.
I've spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt or who have been counted out but who never stop believing that in our country anything is possible. I have lived the promise of America. (Applause.)
And today, I see the promise of America in all of you — (applause) — in all of you, in everyone here.
I see it in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom — (applause) — and the men who support them. (Applause.)
I see it in the fathers and mothers who work hard every day for their children's future.
I see it in Republicans who never voted for a Democrat before but put the Constitution of the United States over party. (Applause.)
And every day I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time. (Applause.)
(Inaudible) all over the place.
And I love your generation. I just love you guys. (Applause.) And let me tell you why. Let me tell you why. One of the reasons is you all are rightly impatient for change. (Applause.) Rightly.
You, who have only known the climate crisis, are leading the charge to protect our planet and our future. (Applause.)
You, who grew up with active shooter drills, are fighting to keep our schools safe. (Applause.)
You — you, who now know fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers, are standing up for freedom.
And what I know about you is these issues are not theoretical. This is not political for you. This is your lived experience. And I see you, and I see your power. I see your power, and I am so proud of you. (Applause.)
Can we hear it for our first-time voters? (Applause.)
So, Wisconsin — okay, we got six days to get this thing done, and no one can sit on the sidelines. So, let's spend the next six days so that when we look backward after the sixth day, we will know we did everything we could. Okay? (Applause.)
So, now is the time to knock on doors — (applause) — to text, to call, to reach out to family and friends and classmates and coworkers and neighbors. And as we do, here's my request: As we do all of that, let's be intentional about building community, and let's be intentional about building coalitions. (Applause.)
Let's remember that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And let's approach this — (applause) — let's approach this with that spirit and with the spirit of in the face of a stranger, seeing a neighbor. Let's do it that way. Okay? (Applause.) Let's do it that way.
And let us remember that your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. (Applause.)
So, Madison, today I ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
  


  

  
    October 30, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hello, Pennsylvania! (Applause.) Good afternoon. (Applause.)
All right. All right. Oh, we got the band in the house. (Applause.) Good. (Laughs.) Okay. We got some work to do. (Applause.) All right. All right. Okay. Okay.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: All right. Okay. All right. Okay. Let's settle down. We — we got some work to do. We got some work to do.
But can we give it up, please, for Chris? Thank you so very much — (applause) — for all your leadership. And, Mikayla, I was looking for you. I don't know where you are, but I'm saying hello to you too, because you are part of the reason I do what I do. Thank you. (Applause.)
All right, Harrisburg. Are we ready to do this? (Applause.)
Are we ready to vote? (Applause.)
Are we ready to win? (Applause.) Yes, you are right.
Oh, it is good to be back in Pennsylvania and with so many incredible leaders, including your extraordinary Lieutenant Governor Davis — (applause); State Representative Kim — (applause); and Mayor Williams. And let's send Bob Casey back to the United States Senate. (Applause.)
All right. Okay. So, this election is underway, and I want to thank everyone for taking the time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon for us to all be under one roof together, sharing this moment of commitment to our country and each other. I thank you all for the time that you are taking for us to all be here together. (Applause.)
All right. So, now is the time to remind our neighbors and our friends to make a plan to vote in person on Election Day — (applause) — or to return your mail ballot.
And, Pennsylvania, if you still have a mail ballot, you can take it to a ballot drop box or an election office in your county by 8:00 p.m. on Election Day. Let's spread the word and ask folks to go to IWillVote.com if they need more information. (Applause.)
So, I'm visiting with you this afternoon because we need you to vote, Pennsylvania. We need you to vote — (applause) — because we have just six days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. And we have work to do. We still have a lot of work to do, but we like hard work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work. (Applause.) Hard work is joyful work. (Applause.)
And make no mistake, we will win. We will win. (Applause.) We will win.
And part of the reason — and part of the reason we will win is because I do believe when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. (Applause.)
And we know we have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. (Applause.) That is who he is, but, Pennsylvania, that is not who we are. (Applause.)
And I know plenty of folks are just exhausted with it all and know that it is time to stop pointing fingers and to start locking arms. It is time — (applause) — it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. (Applause.) And together, with you, we will do this. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States of America. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And let me just say, Pennsylvania, you know my background. I am not afri- — I am not afraid of tough fights. For decades as a prosecutor and the top law enforcement officer of our biggest state, I won fights against the big banks that were ripping off homeowners — (applause); against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students; against predators who abused women and children; and cartels that trafficked in guns, drugs, and human beings. (Applause.)
And if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing that will stand in my way of working for you. (Applause.)
And, look, we know who Donald — Donald Trump is, right? So, this is someone who is not thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable —
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — obsessed with revenge —
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — consumed with grievance —
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and out for unchecked power.
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And, look, in less than 90 days, either he or I will be in the Oval Office.
AUDIENCE: You!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But — (laughs) — but — okay. A- — (laughs) —
Because here's the thing we know: If he is elected, on day one, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: When I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list. (Applause.) And at the top of my list is bringing down your cost of living. That will be my focus every single day as president. (Applause.)
I will give a middle-class tax cut to a hundred million Americans, enact — (applause) — enact the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on groceries — (applause) — and fight to make sure that hardworking Americans can actually afford a place to live. (Applause.)
If you are caring for an elderly parent, my plan will co- — cover the cost of home care under Medicare — (applause) — so seniors can get the help they need and the care they need to stay in their own homes. (Applause.)
It's about dignity. It's about dignity, which is why my plan will also lower the cost of childcare — (applause) — cut — cut taxes for small businesses, and lower health care costs, because I believe health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. (Applause.)
On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to financial pressures is for you to face the same deal you —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
AUDIENCE: Booo —
Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Here's the thing. Let me say — let me say something. Let me say something. We are — ho- — we are six days out of an election. We are six days away from an election, and ours is about a fight for democracy and your right to be heard. (Applause.) That is what is on the line in this election. That is what is on the line in this election.
Look, everybody has a right to be heard, but right now, I am speaking. (Applause.)
And one of the biggest issues that folks around the country want to talk about and hear is about how we are going to bring down the price of living for working people. And people know that Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures that you face is the same as the last time: another trillion-dollar tax cut for billionaires and big corporations.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And this time, he will pay for it with a 20 percent national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — clothes, food, toys, cell phones. And a Trump sales tax would cost the average family nearly $4,000 more a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: These are some of the issues that are on the line in the next six days, and that's why we are here, saying, ""We will not stand for it."" We stand for working people. (Applause.) We stand for middle-class growth and strength.
We are here together because we know what's on the line. We know that Donald Trump will try, like he has so many times, to get rid of the Affordable Care Act —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — which would throw millions of Americans off of their health care and take us back to when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was?
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, we are not going back. (Applause.) We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we are not going back, because ours is a fight for the future — (applause) — and it is a fight for freedom, like the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
And we remember how we got here. Donald Trump, when he was president, hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — with the intention that they would do just as they did and overturn the protections of Roe v. Wade. And now, in America, one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral — immoral.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And, look, Donald Trump is not done. He would ban abortion nationwide — yes, even here in Pennsylvania, if he were successful.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He would restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states to monitor women's pregnancies.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Just google Project 2025. Read the plans for yourself.
And let us agree: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn't be telling people what to do — (applause) — not the government — not the government. If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government or Donald Trump telling people what to do. (Applause.)
And I — I pledge to you, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) I will proudly sign it into law.
So, Pennsylvania, I am asking for your vote. (Applause.) And here — here is my pledge to you. And here is my pledge to you. As your president —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You're war criminals! You're (inaudible) —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — I pledge to seek common ground and commonsense solutions to the challenges you face.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. And let me say — look, I'll repeat it — we are fighting for our democracy. We love our democracy. (Applause.) It can be complicated at times, but it is the best system in the world.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. All right.
So, look, I will continue with my point. I pledge to you that, as president of the United States, I will not be looking to score political points. I will be looking to make progress. (Applause.) And I pledge to listen to experts, to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make, and to the people who disagree with me. (Applause.)
And at this particular moment, it should be emphasized that, unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe people who disagree with me are the ""enemy from within."" (Applause.) He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. (Applause.)
And I pledge to be a president for all Americans and to always put country above party and self. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. That's right.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right.
So, Pennsylvania, look, it all comes down to this. We are all here together and you have taken so much time out of your life to be here because we love our country. We love our country. (Applause.) And when you love something, you fight for it. (Applause.)
And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism, an expression of our love of our country, to then fight for its ideals — to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight for the promise of America. (Applause.) That's what this is about.
I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it. I grew up a child of the Civil Rights Movement. (Applause.) My parents would take me to marches when I was in a stroller, where people from all walks of life, all kinds of backgrounds, came together to fight for the ideals of our country, the ideals of freedom and opportunity.
I've lived the promise of America. I saw how hard my mother worked to give her daughters the same chances our country gave her. Growing up — (applause) — growing up, I was blessed to have family by blood and family by love — (applause) — who instilled in me — like all of us, who instilled in me the values that have always defined our nation at its best, like the value of community, of compassion, and faith.
I've lived the promise of America. I've spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out but who never stop believing that, in our country, anything is possible. (Applause.)
I've lived the promise of America, and I see the promise of America in this beautiful assembly of people, of you who understand — (applause) — what is at stake and also what we have yet to do. That's what this is about. This is about our joy and our optimism, about what has yet to be done that we can do together as one community of people who love their country. (Applause.)
And I see, then, the promise of America in, for example, the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom. (Applause.) I see it — I see it in the men who support them. (Applause.) I see it in Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before but put the Constitution of the United States before party. (Applause.)
I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who I know are here right now, voting for the first time. (Applause.) Let me see your hands. Right?
And I love this generation of leaders, because, listen, you are rightly impatient for change — (applause) — you who are determined to live free from gun violence, to tackle the climate crisis, and shape the world you inherit. (Applause.) For these young leaders, let me tell you, no- — none of this is theoretical for them. It's not political for them. For the young leaders, this is their lived experience. And I see you, and I see your power, and I am so proud of you. (Applause.)
Let's hear it for our first-time voters. Let's h- — (applause). I see you.
So, Pennsylvania, we have six days to get this done. (Applause.) No one can sit on the sidelines. Let's spend the next six days so when we look back, we will know that we've done everything we could. It's time to knock on doors, time to text and call voters, time to reach out to family and friends and neighbors and classmates and coworkers.
And please, in these next six days, let us be intentional about building community. (Applause.) In these next six days, let us please be intentional about building coalition. (Applause.) And let us remember, we all have so much more in common than what separates us. (Applause.)
So, remember, your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. (Applause.)
And I will end by asking you: Pennsylvania, are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. God bless you. (Applause.)

Can we hear it for Jennifer? (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Raleigh, are we ready to do this? (Applause.) Are we ready to vote? (Applause.) Are we ready to win? (Applause.)
Oh, it's good to be back in North Carolina. (Applause.) (Laughs.) Thank you all and all the incredible leaders who are here. Thank you all, everyone, for taking time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon. (Applause.) I thank you. I thank you.
And I want to thank my dear friend, Governor Cooper — Roy Cooper — (applause); Attorney General Josh Stein, who will be your next governor — (applause); Representatives Nickel, Ross, Foushee — (applause); and Mayor Baldwin. I thank you all and all the leaders who are here.
So, Raleigh, early voting, as Jennifer said, has started. Here in Wake County, you can vote early now through Saturday, November 2nd. And we need you to vote early, North Carolina — (applause) — because we have just six days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime, and we have work to do. (Applause.)
But we like hard work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work. (Applause.) Hard work is joyful work. (Applause.)
And make no mistake, we will win. (Applause.) We will win. Yes, we will. And we will win — we will win because when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. (Applause.)
And we know we have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump, who has been trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We know that is who he is, but, North Carolina, that is not who we are. (Applause.) That is not who we are.
And it is time for a new chapter where we stop with the pointing fingers at each other. And instead, let us lock arms with one another, knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us. (Applause.) It is time for a new generation of leadership in America, and I am ready with you. I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States of America. (Applause.)
And, North Carolina, you know, I've been here many, many times over the years. And you know this: I am not afraid of tough fights. (Applause.)
For decades as a prosecutor and as the top law enforcement officer of our biggest state, I won fights against big banks that ripped off homeowners — (applause); against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students — (applause); against predators who abused women and children; against cartels that trafficked in guns and drugs and human beings.

In less than 90 days, either he or I will be in the Oval Office. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And here is the thing. There are many big differences between he and I, but I would say a major contrast is this: If he is elected, on day one, Donald Trump will walk into that office with an enemies list.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
When I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list — (applause) — full of priorities about what I will get done for you, the American people. (Applause.)
And at the top of my list is bringing down your cost of living. (Applause.) That will be my focus every single day as president. I will give a middle-class tax cut to over 100 million Americans — (applause); enact the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on groceries — (applause); and fight to make sure that hardworking Americans can actually afford a place to live.

On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as last time: another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And this time, he will pay for it with a 20 percent Trump national sales tax on everyday basic necessities, which will cost the average American family nearly $4,000 more a year.
On top of that, you will pay even more if Donald Trump finally gets his way and ends the Affordable Care Act, which will throw — if he were to win — which would throw millions of Americans off their health insurance and take us back to when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions.
You remember what that was like?
Well, we are —
AUDIENCE: Not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — not going back. We are not going back. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are not going back. We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Because — and we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future — (applause) — and it is a fight for freedom — (applause) — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
And we all remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. They did.
And now in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, including in North Carolina and every state in the South except Virginia. Think about that. Many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral.
And Donald Trump — understand, he's not done. He would ban abortion nationwide. He would restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states to monitor women's pregnancies.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Just google Project 2025. Just google it. Read the plans yourself.
And let us agree, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be making that decision for you. (Applause.) Not the government.
And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States — (applause) — I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.)
So, North Carolina, I am asking for your vote. (Applause.) I am asking for your vote.
And here is my pledge to you. As your president, I pledge to seek common ground and commonsense solutions to the challenges you face. (Applause.)
I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. (Applause.)
And I pledge to you, I will listen to experts.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I will listen to those impacted by the decisions I make and to people who disagree with me.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And — and importantly —
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And — and, Raleigh —
Q: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: All right. We're fighting — hey, everybody.
Q: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay, you know — see, this is the thing, because we know we're actually fighting for our democracy. (Applause.)
And unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy. (Applause.) He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. (Applause.)
And I pledge to be a president for all Americans and to always put country above party and self.
So, North Carolina, it all comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. (Applause.) That's why we are here. And when you love something, you fight for it. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. (Applause.)
And I have — and I have always believed in our nation's —
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes. And like all of us here, I have always believed in our nation's promise, because I have lived it. I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights Movement. (Applause.) My parents — my parents would take me to marches, when I was in a stroller, where people of every walk of life came together to fight for the ideals of freedom and opportunity.
I've lived the promise of America. (Applause.) I saw — I saw — I saw how hard my mother worked to give her daughters the same chances our country gave her. Growing up, I was blessed to have family by blood and family by love — (applause) — who instilled in me the values that have always defined our nation best — values like community, compassion, and faith.
I've lived the promise of America, and I've spent my life fighting for the people — people who have been hurt and counted out but never stop believing in our country that anything is possible. (Applause.)
I've lived the promise of America, and I see — (applause) — and I see the promise in all of you — in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom — (applause); in the men who support them — (applause); in Republicans who never voted for a Democrat before but put the Constitution of the United States before party.
I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time. Let me see you. (Applause.) I love you guys, because you are rightly impatient for change. (Applause.)
You, young leaders — you've only known the climate crisis and are leading the charge to protect our planet and our future. You, young leaders, who grew up with active shooter drills, who are trying to keep our schools safe. You, who have known fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers and are standing up to fight for freedom to make your own decisions about your own bodies.
None of this for you, young leaders, is theoretical. This is not theoretical for you. It is not political for you. For our young leaders, this is your lived experience. And I see you, and I see your power, and I am so proud of you. (Applause.)
Can we applaud all of our first-time voters and young leaders who are here? (Applause.) Let's applaud them.
See? Our future is bright. I'm telling you: Our future is bright. (Applause.)
So, North Carolina, we have six days to get this done — (applause) — and no one can sit on the sidelines. So, let's spend the next six days so that when we look back at these six days, we will know we did everything we could.
So, right now, it's time to go out from here and knock on some doors — (applause) — time to text and call some voters, time to reach out to family and friends and classmates and coworkers and neighbors.
And as we do, let us please be intentional about building community. (Applause.) Let us please be intentional about building coalitions. Because through all of that, we strengthen our nation, because we know and will always remember the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. (Applause.)
And we are all in this together. So, remember, your vote is your voice and your voice is your power. (Applause.)
So, North Carolina, I then ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win. (Applause.)
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Reno, Nevada
  


  

  
    October 31, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hello, Nevada. (Applause.) We're doing this. Happy Nevada Day! (Applause.)
And can we please hear it for Michon? (Applause.)
Oh, it's good to be back. (Applause.) Oh, it's good to be back. Oh, it's good to be back.
It's — I have spent a lot of time in Reno over the years, and it is so good to be back in Reno. Are we ready to do this? (Applause.)
Are we ready to vote? (Applause.)
Are we ready to win? (Applause.)
Yes. It is so good to be back and with so many incredible leaders. And I want to just start by thanking everyone here for taking time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon for us to celebrate — (applause) — to celebrate each other and community. And I thank you, everyone.
I want to thank my dear, dear friend, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto. (Applause.) As you know, we were AGs together. I was in California; she was here. We were fighting the good fight, arm in arm, always together.
I want to thank Mayor Schieve — (applause); DNC
chair, Jaime Harrison — (applause); Michael Gordon with LiUNA Local 169 — (applause); and, Nevada, please send Jacky Rosen back to the United States Senate. (Applause.)
And to all the Tribal elected and community leaders with us today — (applause) — I thank you. I thank you. I thank you.
So, Reno, tomorrow — well, by the way, Happy Halloween. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
So, tomorrow, Friday, November 1st, is the last day to vote early in person. And if you are voting by mail, please do not wait. Sign the envelope and return your ballot today. Your ballot must be returned to a drop box or postmarked by Election Day, next Tuesday, November 5th. So, please help get the word out and ask people to go to IWillVote.com if they're not sure. (Applause.) Let's spread the word.
And we need you to vote, Nevada. You are going to make the difference in the outcome of this election. And I thank you. I thank you. (Applause.)
So, okay, we got some work to do. Okay, we have five days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. And we do have work to do.
But here's the thing I know about everybody here: We like hard work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. (Applause.) And make no mistake: We will win. We will win. (Applause.) We will win.
And one of the reasons we will win is because I know who the folks are here. I know who you are. And here's the thing about all of us: We know that when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. (Applause.) You know what to fight for.
And we know we have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done with that. (Applause.) We're exhausted by it. We're done with that. We're done with it.
And, Reno, this is the thing. We know that this is not who we are. That's not who we are. And it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. (Applause.) And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States. (Applause.)
And, Nevada — (applause) — we're going to —
AUDIENCE: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) All right. Okay, okay. We got work to do. We got work to do.
So, listen — but let me say this. And a lot of folks here know: I am not afraid of tough fights. For decades, as a prosecutor and as a top law enforcement officer of the — of the first cousin of Nevada, California — (laughter) — I won fights.
I won fights with Catherine against the big banks that ripped off homeowners — (applause); against for profit colleges that scammed veterans and students — (applause); against predators who harmed women and children; against the cartels that trafficked in guns and drugs and human beings.
And it is my pledge to you that if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way of fighting for you — (applause) — for the people.
And, look, we know who Donald Trump is —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — because we all know he is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. And this is someone who is increasingly unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and he's out for unchecked power. And in less than 90 days, either he or I will be sitting in the Oval Office. (Applause.)
And, listen, here's what we can imagine, right? We've all seen on TV — you've seen the Oval Office. But here's the thing. Just — we have to get the word out to help people even just visually imagine what that day will be, because if elected, Donald Trump, on day one, would walk into that office with an enemies list. When I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list — (applause) — on behalf of you.
And at the top of my list is bringing down your cost of living. That will be my focus every single day as president. (Applause.) I will give a middle-class tax cut to over 100 million Americans, enact — enact the first-ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries. (Applause.) I've taken on that issue before. I'll take it on again.
I will make housing more affordable by building more homes and taking on corporate landlords who unfairly buy up all these properties and jack up rents. (Applause.)
We will fight for working families by raising the minimum wage and eliminating taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers. (Applause.)
And if you're caring for an elderly parent — I took care of my mother when she was sick. Listen, this is personal for me, as so many of these issues. If you are taking care of an elderly parent, my plan will cover the cost of home health care for seniors with Medicare — (applause) — so you don't have to deplete whatever savings you've got to qualify for Medicaid.
It's just about dignity so that seniors can stay in their homes and you can be able to do all that you need to do — especially if any of you are in the sandwich generation, raising young kids while you're taking care of your parents. It's just about dignity. (Applause.)
My plan will lower the cost of childcare. Same point: We will also cut taxes for small businesses. Can I see the small-business owners who are here? (Applause.) Oh, I love our small businesses.
And we will lower health care costs, because here's where I come from. I believe that health care should be a right — (applause) — and not just a privilege of those who can afford it.
So, this is about values, right? How do you think about what people need to live with dignity, to live where they are able to work and know that it actually means something that is not just about getting by but getting ahead?
On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as it was the last time: another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And this time, he will pay for it with a 20 percent national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported. Just imagine — on clothes, food, toys, cell phones, — a Trump sales tax that economists have measured will cost you, on average, an additional $4,000 a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on top of that, Donald Trump still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he has a very powerful friend in Congress, the speaker of the House — who recently, if you noticed, said that there will be a, quote, end to Obamacare. The words used were ""no Obamacare,"" which, if he were to get his way, if Trump wins, means they would throw millions of Americans off of health insurance and take us back — which would take us back to when, you'll remember, insurance companies had the ability to deny people with preexisting conditions.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But, Nevada, we are not —
AUDIENCE: Not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — going back. We are not going back. (Applause.) We are not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are not going back. We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. And we are not going back because ours — ours is a fight for the future. (Applause.) And ours is a fight for freedom — (applause) — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body — (applause) — and not have her government tell her what to do.
And we all remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court to overturn Roe versus Wade. They did. And now one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions for rape or incest.
(A protestor disruption can be heard.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You know what? Let me say something about this. We're here because we're fighting for a democracy. (Applause.) Fighting for a democracy.
And understand the difference here. Understand the difference here, moving forward — moving forward. Understand the difference here.
What we are looking at is a difference in this election. Let's move forward and see where we are. Because on the issue, for example, of freedom of choice —
(A protestor disruption can be heard.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's okay. That's okay. That's all right. That's all right. That's okay. That's all right. You know what? Democracy can be complicated sometimes. (Applause.) It's okay.
We're fighting for the right for people to be heard and not jailed because they speak their mind. (Applause.) We know what's at stake.
And on the issue of freedom, listen, Donald Trump is not done. Did anybody hear what he had to say just yesterday? And I'll tell you, it was outrageous.
So, he said on the issue of freedom of choice — reproductive freedom — he said that he will do what he wants. Because, quote, he — this is his perspective, he will do it ""whether the women like it or not."" ""Whether the women like it or not.""
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Can you imagine? And this is not the first time he has told us he does not believe women should have authority or agency over their own bodies.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: This is the same person who said that women should be punished for their choices, and what we know is we — we know what we are seeing. This is someone who simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to make decisions about their own lives.
And we know that what he has planned includes a national abortion ban, restricting access to birth control, putting IVF treatments at risk, and forcing states to monitor women's pregnancies.
You don't have to take my word for it. Google Project 2025.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Read the plans for yourselves.
And I know we all know that one does not have to abandon their faith or reasonably held beliefs to agree that the government should not be telling her what to do with her body. (Applause.)
So, Nevada, to protect your right to make your own health care decisions, vote yes on Question 6. (Applause.) And make sure you vote up and down the ballot to truly protect that right. (Applause.)
And I will tell you, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly. Proudly.
So, Nevada, I am here asking for your vote. (Applause.) I am asking for your vote. And here is my pledge to you —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We've got your back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And — and I've got your back. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
As president, I pledge to you to seek common ground and commonsense solutions to the challenges you face. (Applause.) I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. (Applause.)
And I pledge to listen to experts, to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make, and to listen to people who disagree with me — (applause) — because that's what real leaders do. That's what real leaders do.
And unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that the people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. (Applause.) That's what leadership looks like.
And I pledge to you to always put country above party and self — (applause) — and to be a president for all Americans — for all Americans.
So, it all comes down to this. We are all here together — and, again, you are taking this time to be here — because we love our country. We love our country. And when you love something, you fight for it. (Applause.) You fight for it.
And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism, of our expression of our love for our country, to then fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America.
And I'm going to tell you, I have always believed in our nation's promise, because I have lived it. I grew up a child of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents would take me to marches when I was in a stroller. And at those places, people from all walks of life came together to fight for the ideals of freedom and opportunity.
You know, growing up, I saw how hard my mother worked to give her daughters the same chance our country gave her. And I was blessed to have family by blood and family by love — (applause) — who instilled in me the values of community and compassion and faith.
I've spent my life fighting for the people who have been hurt and who have been counted out and people who never stopped, even then, believing that, in our country, anything is possible.
I've lived the promise of America, and I see the promise of America in everyone here. (Applause.) It is in all of us. It is in all of us. It is in all of us.
It is in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom. (Applause.) It is in the men who support them. (Applause.) It is in the fathers and mothers who work hard every day for their children's future. It is in the Republicans who never voted for a Democrat before but have put the Constitution of the United States above party. (Applause.)
I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time. (Applause.) Right? And I'll tell you what I love about this generation, Gen Z — I'm going to shout you out. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
Let me tell you, what I love about you all, you leaders, you young leaders, is you are rightly impatient for change. (Applause.) I love that about you. You are determined to live free from gun violence, to take on the climate crisis, to shape the world that you inherit. (Applause.) I love that about you.
And for them, I say to everybody else, look, none of this is theoretical. This, for them, is a lived experience. It's not political. It's what they're living.
And to the young leaders, and I say, I see you, I believe in you, and I see your power. You are so powerful. And I would just ask, can we give it up for the first-time voters who are in the house? Can we? (Applause.)
Right. See, I'm telling you: Our future is bright. You just have to see it in front of you. The future of our country is bright.
And so, to the people of Nevada, look, you are ""Battle Born."" (Applause.) And we are ready for the hard work ahead.
We have five days to get it done. And so, look, nobody can sit on the sidelines. Let's spend the next five days so that when we look back on these days, we have no regrets. And let us make sure that we are knocking on doors; that we are texting folks, calling folks, reaching out to family and friends and classmates and neighbors and coworkers.
And as we do — I have a request: As we do, please let's be intentional about building community. And let's be intentional about building coalitions.
You know, these last many years, it's had a way of, you know, trying to make people point their fingers at each other, trying to divide us, trying to make people feel alone. So, let us all, in this moment, be intentional about building back up and reminding folks we have so much more in common than what separates us. (Applause.) So much more. So much more.
And so, we all know here: Your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. (Applause.)
So, today, Nevada, I asked you, then: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.

    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hello, Nevada! (Applause.)
Can we hear it for Jennifer Lopez? (Applause.)
Happy Nevada Day, everybody! (Applause.) Happy Nevada Day. It is good to be back. Hello, Nevada. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. (Applause.) And happy Diwali to everyone celebrating.
So, listen, Las Vegas, are we ready to do this? (Applause.) Are we ready to vote? (Applause.) Are we ready to win? (Applause.)
All right. All right. It is good to be back and to be with so many incredible leaders, including, of course — and for anybody who has a seat, please do feel like sitting. (Laughs.)
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Sí, se puede!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Sí, se puede. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
I want to thank Senator Jacky Rosen, who we must reelect to the United States Senate. (Applause.) And while we're at it, let's reelect Representatives Horsford, Titus, and Lee. (Applause.)
Can we please applaud Maná? (Applause.)
We also have my dear husband, the second gentleman, with us this evening. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
And we are joined by Tribal leaders from across the country here for the National Conference of American Indians. (Applause.) And I have to say, I strongly believe that the relationship between Tribal Nations and the United States is sacred and that we must honor Tribal sovereignty always and embrace our trust and treaty obligations and ensure Tribal self-determination. (Applause.) And, as president, I will defend these principles always. (Applause.)
All right. So, Nevada, tomorrow, Friday, November 1st, is the last day to vote early in person. And, Nevada, if you are voting by mail, please do not wait. Sign the envelope and return your ballot as soon as possible. Your ballot must be returned to a drop box or postmarked by Election Day next Tuesday, November 5th. Go to IWillVote.com. And to all the leaders here, please help get the word out. (Applause.)
And we need you to vote, Nevada, because we have just five days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime, and we have work to do. But we like hard work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work. (Applause.) Hard work is joyful work. (Applause.)
And make no mistake, we will win. (Applause.) We will win. We will win. We will win.
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we will win — we will win because here's what I believe: When you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. (Applause.) And we all know we have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done with that. We're done. (Applause.) We're exhausted with it.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we know that is who he is. That is who he is. But, Las Vegas, that is not who we are. That is not who we are, and it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. (Applause.) And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States. (Applause.)
And, Nevada, you know me. I'm not afraid of tough fights. (Applause.) For decades, as a prosecutor and the top law enforcement officer of our biggest state — the first cousin of Nevada — (laughs) — I won fights against the big banks that ripped off homeowners. I won fights against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students, against predators who abused women and children. I won fights against cartels that trafficked in guns and drugs and human beings.
And I pledge to you, if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way. (Applause.)
And, look, we all know who Donald — Donald Trump is. This is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is increasingly unstable, obsessed with revenge —
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — consumed with grievance —
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and he's out for unchecked power.
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And, look, in less than 90 days, it's either going to be him or me in the Oval Office. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And here's the thing we know — and this is part of what we're fighting for, because we can — we have the image of what it could be — it won't be, but what it could be if he was elected. If he were reelected, on day one, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list.
When I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list on behalf of you — (applause) — on behalf of you. And at the top of my list is bringing down the cost of your living. That will be my focus every single day as president.
I will give a middle-class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. (Applause.) I will enact the first-ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries. (Applause.) I will make housing more affordable by building more homes and by taking on those corporate landlords who unfairly buy up all those properties and then jack up your rent. (Applause.)
And we will fight for working families by raising the minimum wage and eliminating taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers. (Applause.)
And if you are caring for an elderly parent — you know, I took care of my mother when she was sick. If you are taking care of an elderly parent — this is personal for me — my plan will cover the cost of home care for your elder parent under Medicare — (applause) — so you don't have to spend down your savings in order to qualify for Medicaid, so seniors can get the help and care they need to stay in their homes. And this is just a matter of dignity. (Applause.) Dignity.
Dignity is why I will lower the cost of childcare, because we know families are struggling right now and folks just need a little bit to not just be able to get by but get ahead. It's about dignity, and it's about values that you bring to your position of leadership.
And as far as I'm concerned, we're done with the idea that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down, when we know the real measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. (Applause.)
We will cut taxes for small businesses. Do I see any small-business owners in the house? (Applause.) I love our small businesses. You all are part of the backbone of America's economy.
We will lower health care costs, because here's the value I bring to that. I believe health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. (Applause.)
On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as it was last time: another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And this time, he will pay for it with a 20 percent national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported. Think about that: clothes, food, toys, cell phones. A Trump sales tax, the economists say, would cost the average family an extra $4,000 a year.
And on top of that, Donald Trump still is trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he has a powerful friend in Congress, the speaker of the House, who recently said — who recently said there will be, quote, ""No Obamacare if Trump wins"" —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — which would have the effect, if they were to win, to put millions of Americans off of their health insurance — to throw millions of Americans off of their health insurance, to take us back to that time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. Do you remember what that was?
Well, we are not —
AUDIENCE: Going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — going back. We're not going back. We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future — (applause) — and it is a fight for freedom, like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
And we all remember how we got here. When Donald Trump was president, he hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. They did as he intended. And now, in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral.
And Donald Trump isn't done. Did anybody hear what he just said yesterday? He said — I mean, come on. Right? So, he said that he will do what he wants — now I'm about to quote — whether the women ""like it or not.""
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: This is the same person who said that women should be ""punished"" for their choices.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He simply —
AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, I hear you. But you know what?
AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You know what? The courts are going to handle that. The courts will handle that. (Applause.) We'll handle November. How about that? (Applause.) We'll handle November.
Because, see, we know the man simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to be able to make decisions about their own lives. And we know, if he were elected, he would ban abortion nationwide, restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states — listen to this — to monitor women's pregnancies.
Don't believe me. Look at — just google Project 2025, which I cannot believe they put in writing. (Laughter.) And —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) I love you back. I love you back. (Laughs.) (Applause.) I love you back.
And on this topic, I know everyone here knows and agrees that one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn't be telling her what to do — (applause) — not the government and not Donald Trump.
So, Nevada, to make your right heard and to protect your right to make your own health care decisions, I would also recommend you vote yes on Question 6. (Applause.) And make sure you vote up and down the ballot to truly protect your rights. (Applause.)
And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) I will proudly sign it into law. So —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: When we fight —
AUDIENCE: — we win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, Nevada, on that point, I am here to ask for your vote. I am here to ask for your vote. And here is my pledge to you. And here is my pledge to you.
As president, I pledge to seek common ground and commonsense solutions to the challenges you face. I pledge to not try to score political points but to make progress — to make progress in your lives and in our country.
I pledge to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make. I pledge to listen to experts. I pledge to listen to people who disagree with me because, you see, unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy. (Applause.) He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. (Applause.) That's what real leadership looks like. (Applause.)
And I pledge to always put country above party and self and to be a president for all Americans. (Applause.)
And — and now, with five days left in this campaign, my opponent is also making a closing argument to America. I don't know if may- — you may have seen I — I talked in Washington, D.C., the other day. You know, he likes to compare crowd sizes. I had 100,000 people there. (Applause.) (Laughs.)
But listen to what he's saying as his closing argument. It's all about hate and division. Jennifer talked about it. It's all about hate and division. And it's not just what he says; it's what he will do.
Because, if elected, you can be sure he will bring back family separation policies, only on a much greater scale than the last time. We can imagine what he will do with unchecked power, because recall that, recently, the United States Supreme Court — now this is what's different from 2016 and 2020 — the Court said essentially that he will be immune no matter what he does in the White House.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And so, for all the reasons we know, it is time to turn the page on Donald Trump. (Applause.) Let's turn the page.
And it all — it all comes down to this. You all have taken time out of your busy lives to be here tonight, and I thank you for that. And I thank you for that. (Applause.)
And I know that one of the biggest reasons we are all here together tonight is because we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country, and we know, when you love something, you fight for it. (Applause.) When you love something, you fight for it.
And I do — and —
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And — and —
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: We love you!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I love you. And, yes — (laughs) —
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And here's the thing.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism, of our expression of our love for our country, to then fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America.
And I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it. You know, I grew up a child of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents would take me to the marches when I was in a stroller, where people from all walks of life came together to fight for freedom and for opportunity.
You know, growing up, I saw how hard my mother worked to raise her daughters and give us the same chances our country gave her. And I was blessed to have family by blood and family by love — (applause) — who instilled in me the values of community, of compassion, and faith.
And I've spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and who have been counted out but who never stopped believing in what our country can do and what is possible.
I have lived the promise of America, and today I see the promise of America in everyone here tonight — (applause) — everyone here tonight, in all of us.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Sí, se puede!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Sí, se puede.
AUDIENCE: Sí, se puede! Sí, se puede! Sí, se puede!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I see the promise of America. (Laughs.)
AUDIENCE: Sí, se puede! Sí, se puede! Sí, se puede!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I see the promise of America in the fathers and mothers who work hard every day for your children's future. I see it in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom and the men who support them. (Applause.) I see it in Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before but have put the Constitution of the United States before party. (Applause.)
And I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are here and are voting for the first time. (Applause.) Oh, I love Gen Z. I love you guys. (Laughs.) I love you guys.
And here's what I love about our young leaders: You guys are rightly impatient. (Applause.) You are rightly impatient for change. You, our young leaders who are determined to live free from gun violence, to take on the climate crisis. You intend to shape the world you inherit.
I love that about you, because, for you, none of these issues is theoretical. It's not political. This is your lived experience. And I see you, and I see your power. And I'm so proud of you.
And I want everyone here — let's applaud our first-time voters. (Applause.) I'm so proud of our first-time voters and our young leaders. Let's applaud them, our young leaders. (Laughs.)
And I know the people of Nevada, you are ""Battle Born"" — (applause) — and ready for the hard work ahead. So, we got five days to get this done — five days. (Applause.) And no one can sit on the sidelines.
AUDIENCE: No!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, let's spend the next five days so that when we look back on these days, we will have no regrets that we did everything we could, that we knocked on doors, that we text and we called folks, we reached out to family and friends and classmates and neighbors and coworkers.
And as we do, I have another request of you. In these next days, let us please be intentional about building community. (Applause.) Let us please — you know, these — these years, this Trump era, you know, this — this time of trying to have people point their fingers at each other, the division, the hate, the — the trying to make people feel alone, when we all know we all have so much more in common than what separates us.
So, let's be intentional in building community. Let's be intentional in building coalitions. And let us remember: Your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. (Applause.) It's your power. Don't ever let anybody take your power from you.
So, Nevada, today, I then ask you —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Kamala! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Are you ready — are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Phoenix, Arizona
  


  

  
    October 31, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hello, Arizona. (Applause.) Hi, everyone.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you all. Thank you. (Applause.) Okay, we have work to do. Thank you. Thank you.
Can we hear from Ruben Gallego? (Applause.)
And I've known Ruben a long time and, of course, Arizona knows him so well. He is a veteran of the Marine Corps, a proven leader, a champion for all of Arizona, and please send him to the United States Senate. (Applause.)
So, it's so good to be back in Arizona and Phoenix. Are we ready to do this? (Applause.)
Are we ready to vote? (Applause.)
Are we ready to win? (Applause.)
Oh, it's good to be back and to be with so many incredible leaders.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I love you back. (Laughter.)
I want to thank Governor Hobbs; Senator Kelly; Gabby Giffords — (applause); Mayors Gallego, Romero, and Giles — (applause); Ambassador Jeff Blake. (Applause.) I am so grateful to all of you for your support.
And to all the Tribal leaders, the elected leaders, community leaders here today — (applause) — I thank you.
And let's hear it again for Los Tigres Del Norte. (Applause.)
Okay, work to do. So, Arizona, tomorrow, Friday, November fir- — by the way, Happy Halloween. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
So, tomorrow, Friday, November 1st is the last day to vote early in person. And if you are voting by mail and still have your ballot, please take it to any drop box in your county or any voting location by 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday, November 5th. And you can go to IWillVote.com to get all the information you need.
And to all the leaders here: Please help spread the word on that. (Applause.) Okay?
And we need you to vote, Arizona, because we have five days left — (applause) — five days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime.
And we have work to do, but we like hard work. (Applause.)
Hard work is good work. (Applause.) Hard work is joyful work. (Applause.)
And make no mistake, we will win. (Applause.) We will win. We will win. We will win.
And we will win because we know that it's very clear to all of us here: When you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. (Applause.)
And we love our country. And we love our country. And we know, in this election, we have an opportunity to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done with that. We're exhausted with that.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we know — and we know that's who he is. But, Phoenix, that is not who we are. (Applause.) That is not who we are. And it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. (Applause.) And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States. (Applause.)
And, Arizona, many of you know me. I'm not afraid of tough fights. For decades, I was a prosecutor. I was the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state in our country, and I have won fights. I won fights against the big banks that ripped off homeowners, against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students, against predators who abused women and children. And we are fighting for democracy —
(A protestor disruption can be heard.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And that's all right. That's all right. Democracy can be complicated, but we believe in democracy and the right of everyone — (applause) — to have their voices heard. It's all right.
And I have fought for many who have harmed other human beings. I have fought against the cartels that trafficked in guns, drugs, and human beings, and it is my pledge to you that if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way. (Applause.)
And look, we all know who Donald Trump is. This is not —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Because here's the thing we all know: He is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power. And in less than 90 days, it will either be him or me in the Oval Office. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes, we're going to get this done. And — and I thank you. I thank you. And here's the thing, because we're really clear, and we can all picture it — we can picture the Oval Office, right? And if he is elected, on day one, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. On day one, when I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list. (Applause.)
And on top of my list is bringing down —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Sí, se puede, sí. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Sí, se puede.
AUDIENCE: Sí, se puede! Sí, se puede! Sí, se puede!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes. And on top of my list, in that spirit, is bringing down your cost of living. (Applause.) It's an issue that we need to address, and it will be my focus every single day as President.
I will give a middle-class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. (Applause.) I will enact –I will enact the first-ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries. (Applause.) I will fight to make sure that hardworking Americans can actually afford a place to live. (Applause.)
And if you are caring for an elderly parent — look, I took care of my mother when she was sick.
(A protestor disruption can be heard.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: If you are taking care of an elderly parent, I understand what you are experiencing, and my plan will cover the cost of care under Medicare for the seniors in your life who need help and support. (Applause.)
Because so much of my plan, for me, is about the dignity that all people deserve, which is why my plan inlu- — includes lowering the cost of childcare, cutting taxes for small businesses, and lowering health care costs.
Do we have small businesses in the house? (Applause.)
I will focus on health care, because this is where I come from. I believe access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. (Applause.)
On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to th- —
(A protestor disruption can be heard.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hey, guys, you know what? Here is the thing. Let's talk for a moment about Gaza. We all want this war to end and get the hostages out. (Applause.) And I will work on it full time when I am elected president, as I've been.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We've got your back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I have yours. (Applause.)
So, there's a contrast in this election on so many issues, including our plans for America's economy. Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as the last time: another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires and the biggest corporations, and this time he will pay for it.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And this time, his plan is a 20 percent national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported: clothes, food, toys, cell phones.
A Trump sales tax, according to The Economist, would cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on top of that, Donald Trump still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — also known as Obamacare, and he has a powerful friend in Congress, the speaker of the House, who recently said, if Trump wins, there will be, quote, ""no Obamacare,"" which would throw — understand the meaning of that. It would throw millions of Americans off of their health insurance and take us back to the time, which we remember, when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions.
Well, we are —
AUDIENCE: Not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — not going back. We are not going back. (Applause.) We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back.
And we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom — (applause) — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
And remember how we got here: Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended. And now, in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral.
And — and — and Donald Trump is not done. Did everyone hear what he just said yesterday? That he will do what he wants, quote — and here's where I'm going to quote — ""whether the women like it or not.""
AUDIENCE: Booo —
Vote! Vote! Vote!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we must vote, because this is the thing. You know, there's a saying that you got to listen to people when they tell you who you are — who they are. And this is not the first time he has told us who he is. He does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about their own bodies.
This is the same man who said women should be punished for their choices. He simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to know what's in their own best interest and make decisions accordingly.
But we trust women. (Applause.) We trust women, which is why, yes, we will vote, because we also understand, if he was elected, he has been pretty clear in his behavior and his deeds. He will ban abortion nationwide. He will restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states to monitor women's pregnancies.
And you don't have to take my word for it. Just google Project 2025.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Read the plans for yourself.
And I think everyone here knows that we can agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn't be telling her what to do. (Applause.) Not the government. Not the government.
So, Arizona, to protect your right to make your own health care decisions, I would recommend you vote yes on Proposition 139 — (applause) — and make sure you vote up and down the ballot to truly protect that right.
And it is my pledge to you: When Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly.
So, Arizona, I'm here to ask for your vote — (applause) — which I would be so honored to have. And here is my pledge to you. As president, I pledge to you to seek common ground and commonsense solutions to the challenges you face.
I will tell you I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress.
I pledge to you to listen to experts, to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make, and I pledge to you to listen to people who disagree with me.
And unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy. Who — he wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table — (applause) — because that's how a democracy works, and that's how real leaders work. (Applause.)
And I pledge to you to always put country above party and above self and to be a president for all Americans. (Applause.) That is my sincere pledge to you.
And so, Phoenix, with five days left in this campaign, my opponent is also making his closing argument to America —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And you've probably seen a bit of it. It is an argument that is full of hate and division. He insults Latinos, scapegoats immigrants. And it's not just what he says, it's what he will do. If elected, you can be sure he will bring back family separation policies —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — only on a much greater scale than last time. And it is time then to turn the page on Donald Trump. (Applause.) We are done with that.
So, five days out, and it all comes down to this. We are here together, and you all have taken time out of all the demands on your life and your busy schedules. You have taken the time to be here because I know we all love our country. We love our country. (Applause.) We love our country.
And when you love something, you fight for it. You fight for it.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes. Yes. And with that spirit — and with this spirit, we know that one of the highest forms of patriotism, the love that we have for our country, is to then fight for its ideals and to fight to realize the promise of America. That's what this is about.
And I have always believed in our nation's promise, because I have lived it. I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents would take me to marches when I was in a stroller. And people, during that time, would come together from every walk of life, together from every background, every race, and come together to fight for freedom and opportunity. (Applause.)
Gro- — growing up — when I was growing up, I saw how hard my mother worked to give her two daughters the same chances our country gave her. And I was blessed to have family by blood and to have family by love — (applause) — who instilled — who instilled in me the values of community and compassion and faith.
I've spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out but never stopped believing that anything in our country is possible.
I have lived the promise of America, and today I see the promise of America in everyone here, in all of you. (Applause.)
I see the promise of America in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom — (applause) — and the men who support them — (applause); in the fathers and mothers who work hard every day for their children's future — (applause); in Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before but put the Constitution of the United States before party. (Applause.)
And I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time. (Applause.) Where are you? Let me see you.
And I love this generation of leaders. You are rightly — (applause) — I mean, you guys are rightly impatient for change. (Applause.) And you are determined to live free from gun violence, to tackle the climate crisis, to shape the world you inherit. (Applause.)
And for our young leaders — here's the thing. None of this is theoretical for them. It's not political. For you all, it is your lived experience. And I see you, and I see your incredible power, and I am so proud of you. So, can we hear it for the first-time voters who are here? (Applause.)
Although, why aren't you guys in class? (Laughter.) It's okay.
So, Arizona, we have five days to get this done, and no one can sit on the sidelines. Let's spend the next five days so that when we look back on these five days, we'll know we did everything we could.
So, let's knock on doors. Let's text and call voters. Let's reach out to family and friends and neighbors and coworkers and classmates.
And as we do, here is my request. Let us please be intentional about building community. Let us be intentional about building coalitions.
You know, there's been so much about these last several years that is making people feel alone, making people point their fingers at each other as though we're not all in this together.
So, let's approach this with the spirit that is about bringing folks back together, and reminding everyone, the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. (Applause.) So, let's approach it that way. Let's approach it that way. We will be the stronger for it.
And always remember: Your vote is your voice and your voice is your power. (Applause.)
So, Arizona, today, I ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Janesville, Wisconsin
  


  

  
    November 01, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hey, everybody. (Applause.) Good afternoon.
Can we hear it again for Garrik? (Applause.)
Oh, it's good to be in the house of labor. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Oh, and it's great to be with so many leaders. Thank you, everybody, for taking the time to be here this afternoon for this conversation. But most importantly, thank you for all of your work. (Applause.)
I proudly stand with labor. I have my whole entire career. I always will. This is about the dignity of work. It is about America's workforce. It is about our future, and it's just about what is right. I thank you all so very much. (Applause.) Thank you.
And, Senator Baldwin — where are you? — I thank you for all you do. Let's reelect her to the United States Senate. (Applause.) Governor Evers, thank you for being such a friend and such a leader. Peter Barca, I thank you for all your work. Let's send him to the U.S. House of Representatives. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Go Peter!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And — (laughs) — yeah, that's right.
And to all the labor leaders here today, including Secretary-Treasurer Noble and President Raes, I thank you all. And all the brothers and sisters of IBEW, thank you for all the work you do.
I will tell you — I think it's now an open secret — I have as a dream that I will — I will visit every IBEW Local in the country. (Laughter.) (Applause.) I'm — I'm on my way. I'm well on my way. But, you know, I got more to do.
But I am such a huge fan of what you do. I am such a huge fan of what you do, because it is about the work you do every day and the apprenticeship programs. You are building America and America's future. And it is such good, good work and exciting work to the benefit of everyone.
So, I'm so happy to be with all of you this afternoon. I thank all of the folks who are here. We have autoworkers here. We have care workers here. We have teachers here. I thank you all. (Applause.) Thank you.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, let's get to work. I love you back. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
So, Janesville, we have just four days left — four days left — (applause) — in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. And we have a lot of work still to do, but I know who's here. We like hard work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work. (Applause.) Hard work is joyful work. (Applause.)
And we will win. And we will win. (Applause.) We will win. We will win.
And part of the reason we will win is because we know that when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. (Applause.) And we have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump, who had spent full time trying to have the American people point fingers at each other, full time trying to divide us, have people be afraid of each other. And folks are exhausted with this stuff. (Applause.)
And we know that's who he is. That's not who we are. That's not who we are. (Applause.)
And nobody understands better than a union member that, as Americans, we all rise or fall together. Here in Janesville and across our nation, union members have helped lead the figh- — fight for fair pay, better benefits, safer working conditions, and every person in America benefits from your work.
I tell people everywhere I go, ""Thank a union member. Thank a union member."" (Applause.) Because you not — you may not be a member of a union, but thank a union member if you got a five-day workweek. (Applause.) Thank a union member for your sick leave. Thank a union member for your paid vacation leave. Thank a union member for paid family leave. Because it is union members that work and put blood, sweat, and tears into raising the conditions of the American worker, wherever they work. (Applause.)
And collective bargaining benefits our entire nation. You know, I try to explain to some folks — I li- — you know what? Here's the thing about collective bargaining. I'm going to break it down for you. I don't need to break it down for anybody here, but — (laughter) — but to — you know, to people who are not here. And I say: Look, wouldn't we all want a system that says that, in any negotiation, the outcome would be fair? Right? All reasonable people should want that, in any negotiation, the outcome would be fair.
All right. So, if you're talking about the worker — one worker, against the company, against the corporation, is that outcome going to be fair?
AUDIENCE: No.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: No. The disparity in power is so extreme that that negotiation, if you're just requiring that worker to negotiate for better working conditions, better benefits, fairer pay, it's not going to be fair. Collective bargaining says let the collective, the workers who all stand in the same place, join together as a collective and then negotiate to better ensure just one simple thing: that the outcome is fair. (Applause.) That's what is behind — that's what is behind this. It's about basic fairness, but sometimes you got to fight for fairness.
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And what we know is that when union wages go up, everybody's wages go up. (Applause.) When union workplaces are safer, everyone's workplace is safer. And when unions are strong, America is strong. (Applause.) Bottom line. Bottom line.
And everything that we have fought for is on the line in this election. In less than 90 days, it's either going to be Donald Trump or me sitting in the Oval Office.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's going to be you!
AUDIENCE: You! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But here's the thing that we want to he- —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Madam President! Madam President! Madam President!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) I appreciate you, brother.
AUDIENCE: Madam President! Madam President! Madam President!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Not yet. Four days. Four days. We still got work to do.
And part of what I'm trying to explain to m- —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I appreciate you, brother, but let me tell you — (laughter) — part of the thing that I'm trying to help people — not who are here, obviously; not the leaders who are here but others — understand, is if you're trying to kind of figure out what the stakes are, just imagine the Oval Office. We've all seen it on TV. And just imagine on January 20th. Because if he is elected, if Donald Trump is elected, he's going to be sitting in that Oval Office, stewing over his enemies list, because he spends full time plenting — plotting revenge and retribution — full time. The man is angry, right? It — it — but you know what I'm talking about.
So, imagine on January 20th, it's either that — him plotting over his enemies list — or me, working for you on my to-do list. (Applause.) That's what we're talking about. That's what we're talking about. That's what we're talking about.
Because I like hard work, and at the top of my list is bringing down your cost of living. And it will be my focus every single day as president. I will always put the middle class first. I come from the middle class, and I never forget where I come from. (Applause.) I never forget where I come from. Never.
And we know, to strengthen the middle class, we must make sure that America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century. (Applause.)
Under my plan, we will invest in the industries that built America, like steel, iron, the electric power industry. (Applause.) And we will ensure that the next generation of breakthroughs, from advanced batteries to cutting-edge solar panels, are not just invented but built right here in America by American workers — (applause) — by American workers.
And as part of that vision, we will invest in manufacturing communities across Wisconsin and across America. And we will retool existing factories. They've been built out, but we need to upgrade them. They are where the people are, and where those people are, they don't want to have to leave. They want to stay home. They want their kids and their grandkids to be where they are.
So, we will retool those factories. We will hire locally and work with unions to create good-paying jobs, including, by the way, jobs that do not require a college degree. (Applause.) Because here's the thing. We got to really understand and do better in understanding that a college degree is not the only measure of the skills and the experience of the qualified worker, right? (Applause.)
And I'm telling you — so, the press is always asking me, ""What are you going to do on day one?"" One of the things I'm doing on day one, because I can do it by executive order, is I will eliminate unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs — (applause) — and then I will challenge the private sector to do the same. (Applause.)
As we go forward, when we win, we will also continue to fight to expand the freedom to organize by passing the PRO Act — (applause) — and work to end union busting once and for all. (Applause.)
We will protect the pensions of union workers and retirees. (Applause.) I've done it before. I'll do it again, because when it comes to your pension, Social Security, Medicare, those are retirement benefits that the people have earned — have earned and are due without anyone trying to take them away. (Applause.)
And for me, look, this issue is about dignity. It's about the dignity that any individual who has worked hard all their lives that they absolutely deserve, which is to retire with dignity, and it is about the dignity of work. It is about the dignity of hard work and what should then be the benefit of those years of hard work.
But, look, Donald Trump has a very different view of it all. Independent economists have said his plans would bankrupt Social Security in the next six years. And we know a lot of folks are out there, their Social Security check is the only thing that they've got.
He called for raising the retirement age to 70. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare.
And remember, he said he was the only one — you know how he talks — (laughter) — he said he — he was the only one who could bring back America's manufacturing jobs. And then America lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs when he was president, including thousands of jobs right here in Wisconsin.
And — and facts be clear: Those losses started before the pandemic — okay? — making Donald Trump one of the biggest losers of manufacturing jobs — (applause) — in America's history. It's the truth.
And his track record for the auto industry was a disaster. As —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well — (laughter). And so, as president, he promised that the auto industry would not, quote, ""lose one plant"" during his presidency. Then American auto manufacturers announced the closure of six auto plants when he was president.
Janesville, you know what those closures mean for communities: thousands of union jobs lost, factory sites sitting empty for years, other businesses in town then forced to close.
So, Wisconsin, you know all about Donald Trump's big empty promises. He promised to stop offshoring. Then he cut taxes –he cut taxes for corporations that shipped 200,000 American jobs overseas during his presidency.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he promised to bring jobs back to the United States, like his promise that Foxconn was going to invest —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — was going to invest $10 billion and create 13,000 manufacturing jobs in Mount Pleasant. You remember that. He said Wisconsin would soon be home to a manufacturing plant that he called — again, Donald Trump language — ""the eighth wonder of the world."" (Laughter.)
Yet another empty promise, typical for a person that is all talk, no walk. (Applause.)
And all that to say, we here know Donald Trump is no friend to labor — no friend to labor. He has been a union buster his entire career. He has called union leaders quote, ""dues-sucking"" people.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He said that he supports the so-called right-to-work laws 100 percent.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He joked with a billionaire buddy of his about the mass firing of striking workers.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And while he was president, he lowered labor standards and made it easier for companies to break labor laws and then get federal contracts, right?
And so, part of why I'm here is to ask all the leaders here, let's remind all the brothers and sisters of labor about who Donald Trump really is, because he's got a lot of talk, but if you pay attention to what he's actually done, if you pay attention to who he has actually stood with when people needed a defender and a friend, you'll see who he really is.
And we got to get the word out about this, because there's a whole lot of misinformation about what he is and who he stands with. And we know he does not stand with organized labor.
So, here's the bottom line. Donald Trump's track record is a disaster for working people, and he is an existential threat to America's labor movement. (Applause.) And — and everything Donald Trump intends to do if he is reelected is spelled out in Project 2025, which I still cannot believe they put that thing in writing. (Laughter.) Like, they bound it, handed it out, and people read it, and now they can't handle that. Right?
He intends to launch a full-on attack on unions and the freedom to organize. He will ban public-sector unions. I know we've got AFSCME here, right? He will roll back workplace safety protections. He will make it easier for companies to deny overtime pay for workers.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Talk about trying to take us back. And he will appoint a union buster to run the Department of Labor —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — not to mention what would happen with NLRB, right?
So, I say all this to say to the friends that America, as we all know, is ready to chart a new way forward. We are ready for a new generation of leadership for America — (applause) — and especially the leadership that together we all offer that is optimistic about what we can achieve when we are working together.
There's a certain spirit of how we think about all this that directly relates to whether, as we move forward, we will be stronger or not. And here's the thing that we all know: We're not going back. (Applause.) We are not going back. We're not going —
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We're not going back. We are not going back.
And — and here's the thing, Janesville: It all comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. We love our country. (Applause.) We love our country.
And what you all know better than most is when you love something, you fight for it — (applause) — you fight for it. And I do believe one of the highest forms of patriotism, of our expression of our love for our country, is to then fight for the ideals of our country. And that's what's at play in this election. And it is about a fight to realize the promise of America.
So, we got four days, and we're going to get this done, but nobody can sit by the sidelines.
AUDIENCE: No!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We got to remind everybody. You know, five days from now, you don't want to look back on these four days and have any regrets about what you could have done. And everybody here knows how to organize, so I don't need to tell you that it's all about talking with each other. It's about reaching out to each other. It's about, in the face of a stranger, seeing a neighbor and helping — and unity and helping people understand that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. (Applause.)
And labor how — knows how to do that best. We knock on doors, know how to text and call folks — (applause) — reaching out to family and friends and neighbors. And we'll remind people that their vote is their voice, and their voice is their power, right? (Applause.)
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, brothers and sisters, today, I ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard?
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in freedom?
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in opportunity?
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in the promise of America?
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And are we ready to fight for it?
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. God bless you. God bless you. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in West Allis, Wisconsin
  


  

  
    November 01, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hello, Wisconsin! (Applause.) Let's hear it for Adrien — (applause) — Cardi B. (Applause.)
Oh, it's good to be back. Good evening. (Applause.)
Milwaukee, are we ready to do this? (Applause.) Are we ready to win? (Applause.) Are we ready to vote? (Applause.) And we will win. (Applause.)
Oh, it's good to be back in Wisconsin and to be with so many leaders. I thank everyone here for taking the time out of your busy lives to be here this evening. I thank you. I thank you. I thank you. I thank you. (Applause.)
And can we please hear it for Tammy Baldwin? Let's reelect her to the United States Senate. (Applause.) County Executive Crowley, Mayor Johnson, Cardi B — let's give it up. (Applause.)
And can we hear it again for MC Lyte, Flo Milli, GloRilla, Keegan-Michael Key? (Applause.)
Oh, what a good night.
All right, we got work to do in Milwaukee. Okay. Four days left. (Applause.) Four days left in the most consequential election of our lifetime, and we still have work to do. (Applause.)
But here's the thing about all of us: We like hard work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And make no mistake, we will win. (Applause.) We will win.
And here's one of the reasons why: Because when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. (Applause.) And in this election, we have an opportunity to finally turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We are done with it. We are exhausted with it. We are turning the page. (Applause.)
And it's because we know that's what he's about. He is constantly about trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other. But that's not who we are. That's who he is. That is not who we are. (Applause.)
And it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. (Applause.) And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States. (Applause.)
And, Wisconsin, you know me: I'm not afraid of tough fights, obviously. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
For decades, as a prosecutor and the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state, I won fights. I won fights against the big banks who were ripping off homeowners. I won fights against for-profit colleges that were scamming veterans and students. I won fights against predators who abused women and children. I won fights against cartels that trafficked in guns and drugs and human beings. (Applause.)
And I pledge to you, if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf, there is nothing that will stand in my way as I fight for you. (Applause.)
And, look, we know who Donald Trump is. This is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is increasingly unstable — (applause) –obsessed with revenge. (Applause.) He is consumed with grievance. (Applause.) And the man is out for unchecked power. (Applause.)
And, look, in less than 90 days, it's either going to be him or me in the Oval Office. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Booo —
Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you.
But let's get the word out. Let's get the word out to the folks who are not here to just have them imagine — you know, we've all seen the Oval Office on TV. Imagine, on January 20th, that day, it's either going to be Donald Trump, if he is elected, which he will not be —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Which he will not be.
But to help people imagine what the stakes are, it's either going to be him there on day one, walking into that office, stewing over his enemies list —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — or when I am elected, walking in on your behalf, with my to-do list. (Applause.) And I'm a hard worker. (Laughs.)
And at the top of my list is bringing down the cost of living for you. (Applause.) That will be my focus every single day as president.
I will give a middle-class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. (Applause.) I will enact the first-ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries. (Applause.) And I will fight to make sure that hardworking Americans can actually afford a place to live. (Applause.)
If you are caring for an elderly parent, if you are in the sandwich generation caring for an elderly parent and young children, I will tell you, my plan will cover the cost of home care under Medicare. (Applause.) Because I took care of — I took care of my mother when she was sick. And I know what you are doing, whether it be trying to cook something that they feel like eating, whether it be trying to help them put on a sweater, trying to find a moment where you can bring a smile to their face or make them laugh. That work is about dignity. That work is about dignity. (Applause.) And I'm going to make sure you have the support and they have the support they deserve. (Applause.)
My plan will lower the cost of childcare. Again, it's about dignity. It's about seeing the strains and the pressures.
We will cut taxes for small businesses because our small businesses are the backbone of America's economy. (Applause.) Where are our small-business owners? Let me see our small-business owners. (Applause.)
And we will lower health care costs, because here's where I come from on that: Look, I believe access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. (Applause.) Dignity — values about the dignity of each of us and the responsibility of real leaders to, unlike my opponent, not think that the measure of their strength is based on who you beat down, but the true measure of strength of a leader based on who you lift up. (Applause.)
And then, you got Donald Trump, who —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And his answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as it was the last time: another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires and the biggest corporations.
AUDIENE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And this time, he will pay for it with a 20 percent national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported: clothes, foods, toys, cell phones — a Trump sales tax that would cost the average American family — the economists have measured it — more than 4,000 more dollars a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on top of that, Donald Trump is still — still trying and still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — which would throw millions of Americans off their health insurance and take us back to when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was like?
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, we are —
AUDIENCE: Not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — not going back. We are not going back. We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back, no.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Because — because, just like Wisconsin's motto tells us, we will move —
AUDIENCE: Forward!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — forward. (Applause.) Yes, we will. I love Wisconsin. (Laughs.)
And ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom — (applause) — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. (Applause.)
And we all remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. They did as he intended, and now, in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban. Many —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right? Man- — and the harm we've seen. Many of those laws with no exception, even for rape or incest, which is immoral.
And he's not done. He would ban abortion nationwide — yes, even here in Wisconsin.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Even here in Wisconsin, it would be impacted. And he would restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force — get this — and force states to monitor women's pregnancies. Just —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — google Project 2025. Just look at it.
And everyone here, I know, understands — and let us agree, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to simply agree the government shouldn't be telling her what to do. (Applause.) Not the government. Not the government. Not the government. Not some people up in a state legislature, and certainly not Donald Trump. (Applause.)
And I pledge to you, when Congress — together with Tammy's help, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly.
So, Wisconsin —
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We got work to do. Thank you. Thank you.
So, Wisconsin, I am asking for your vote. (Applause.) I am asking for your vote.
And here — and here is my pledge to you: As president, I pledge to seek common ground and commonsense solutions to the challenges you face. I am not — (applause) — I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. (Applause.) And I pledge — and I pledge to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make.
I pledge to listen to experts, to listen to people who disagree with me, because, you see — (applause) — unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy. (Applause.) He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. (Applause.) That's what real leadership is about. That's what strong leadership is about. (Applause.)
And I pledge to always put country above party and self and to be a president for all Americans. (Applause.) All Americans.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, that — that is my pledge to you, Wisconsin, and now I ask you a question: Who here has already voted? (Applause.) Oh, wow.
Okay. Thank you. And now I ask you to please talk to your friends and your family and your neighbors — (applause) — and share your perspective on why this is — election is so important.
And for you who have not voted yet, no judgment. Let me just be clear — (laughs) — no judgment at all. But do get to it, if you can. (Laughter and applause.)
And for those who have not yet voted, please think about, right now, your plan for voting and think about where and when you will vote. And if you live here in Milwaukee, remember you can vote early now through Sunday, November 3rd. (Applause.) And go to IWillVote.com for all the information you need, including when and where you can vote and where to drop off your absentee ballot, because we need everyone in Wisconsin to vote. (Applause.) You are going to make the difference in this election. You will make the difference. You will make the difference.
AUDIENCE: Vote! Vote! Vote!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, listen, it all comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. We love our country. (Applause.) We love our country. And when you love something, you fight for it. (Applause.) You fight for it. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism, of our expression for our love of our country, to then fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. (Applause.) That's what this is about.
And I have always believed in our nation's promise because I've lived it. You know, I grew up a child of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents would take me to marches when I was in a stroller, and there were, at those marches, we all know, people from every walk of life coming together to fight for freedom and to fight for opportunity.
You know, growing up, I saw how hard my mother worked to raise her two daughters to have the same chances that our country gave her. And I was blessed to have family by blood and family by love — (applause) — right? — who instilled in me a sense of community and compassion and faith.
And I've spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out but who never stopped believing, in our country, that anything is possible.
I have lived the promise of America, and today I see the promise of America in everyone who is here — in all of you, in all of us. (Applause.) We are the promise of America. We are the promise of America.
It's the fathers and mothers and grandparents who work hard every day for their children's future, in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom — (applause) –and the men who support them. (Applause.) It's in the Republicans who never voted for a Democrat before but put the Constitution of the United States above party. (Applause.) Right.
I see the promise of America in all the young leaders that I see right now who are voting for the very first time. Raise your hand. (Laughs.) (Applause.) I love Gen Z. (Laughs.) (Applause.) I really do.
Here's what I love about you guys. You are rightly impatient for change. (Applause.) I love that about you. I love that about you.
You are determined to live free from gun violence. You are going to take on the climate crisis. You are going to shape the world you inherit. (Applause.) I know that. I know that.
And here's the thing about our young leaders: None of this is theoretical for them. None of this is political for them. It's their lived experience. It's your lived experience. And I see your power. I see your power, and I am so proud of you.
Can we please hear it for our first-time voters? (Applause.) Can we please hear it? Yeah. Yeah. And those who will be first-time voters. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
You know, the future of our country is so bright; we just have to see it. It's so bright.
So, listen, we got four days to get this thing done. (Applause.) Four days. No one can sit on the sidelines.
So, let's spend the next four days so that when we look back on these days, we have no regrets about what we could have done. (Applause.) Let's know we did everything we could do.
So, let's knock on doors. Let's text. Let's call. Let's reach out to family and friends and classmates and neighbors and coworkers.
And here's a request that I have in that process: And while we are doing all of that, let's please be intentional about building community. (Applause.) Let's please be intentional about building community.
You know, there's something about these la- — this whole Trump era, and it's — it's — you know, it's — it's been a — it's made people feel like they have to — it — it's been powered by this idea that Americans should be pointing their fingers at each other, you know, and — and to make people feel alone and make people feel small, when we all know that we all have so much more in common than what separates us. (Applause.)
So, let's be intentional about building community and building coalitions. There is strength and power in that that will be long-lasting.
And finally, I'll say: Just remember, and let's remind everybody we know, your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. (Applause.) That's your power.
In a democracy, that is a power that is yours. Don't let anyone take it from you. Don't let anyone take it from you. (Applause.)
So, Wisconsin — so, Wisconsin, today, I ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

Jen- — I just — first, I just want — Jennifer, I want to thank you. Jennifer and I had s- — time to visit backstage, and we first met in 2020 on a Zoom talking about the Affordable Care Act, and your son is doing well now. You are an incredible leader. (Applause.) And I thank you so very much. Let's hear it for Jennifer, please. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

And I want to thank my dear friend, Tammy Baldwin — (applause) — send her back to the United States Senate — (applause); Lieutenant Governor Rodriguez — (applause); County Executive Nelson — (applause); and the chair of our Democratic Party, Ben Wikler. (Applause.)
All right, we have work to do.
Okay, Wisconsin, four days left in probably one of if not the most consequential elections of our lifetime, and we have work to do still. We have a lot of work to do, but we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. (Applause.) And make no mistake: We will win. (Applause.) We will win. We will win. We will win.
And one of the reasons —
AUDIENCE: We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And — yes.
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We will win. And we will win — and we will win because we are the type of people who we know when you know what to stand for, you know what to fight for — (applause) — you know what to fight for. Right?
And in this election, we have an opportunity to finally turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're done with that. We're done. We're exhausted with that. And we know that's who he is, but, Wisconsin, that's not who we are. That's not who we are. (Applause.) That's not who we are. And it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. (Applause.) And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States of America. (Applause.)
And, Wisconsin, you know me, I'm not afraid of tough fights. For decades — clearly — (laughter) — for decades, I was a prosecutor and the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state, and I won fights against the big banks who ripped off homeowners, against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students, against predators who abused women and children, against cartels that trafficked in guns and drugs and human beings. And I pledge to you, if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way. (Applause.) Nothing in the world.
And look — and on the other side, we know who Donald Trump is. Now this is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. He is someone who is increasingly unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and the man is out for unchecked power. He's out for unchecked power.
And in less than 90 days — you can picture the Oval Office. In less than 90 days, it's either going to be him or me sitting in the Oval Office.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But with your help —
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) Okay.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: A- — a- — (laughs) —
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Inaudible.) Thank you.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But — but let's help — let's help the friends and family and neighbors who is — who are not here right now imagine that for a minute — right?
January 20th. Oval Office. It's either going to be him sitting in there, poring over and stewing over his enemies list —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Or, when I am elected, it will be me walking in there on your behalf, working on my to-do list — (applause) — because we got work to do. Because we have work to do.
And at the top of my list is bringing down the cost of living for you. (Applause.) That will be my focus every single day as president, including I will give a middle-class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. (Applause.) We will enact the first-ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries — (applause) — and fight to make sure that hardworking Americans can actually afford a place to live. (Applause.)
And one of the things that we were talking aba- — backstage is about the importance of people being able to care for their family members, and, including and in particular, their elder family members. (Applause.) And some of you may know — and this is personal for me, as are so many of these issues.
I took care of my mother when she was sick. And I — and I know what it is in terms of taking care of someone and just trying to cook the things that they feel like eating, right? Just trying to help them put on a sweater, trying to think from time to time, ""What can I do to put a smile on their face or make them laugh?""
It is important work, and it is work that is about dignity. It's about dignity, and if you are caring, then, for an elderly parent or relative, my plan is to cover the cost of home care under Medicare — (applause) — so you don't have to worry about either spending down whatever savings you have to qualify for Medicaid or quitting your job and cutting off a source of income to be able to stay at home, in particular if you're in the sandwich generation, meaning that you are taking care of your kids while you are taking care of a parent.
It's about dignity. And my plan will also lower the cost of childcare. Again, about dignity. (Applause.) About dignity.
My plan is to prioritize cutting taxes for small businesses. Do we have small-business owners here? I love our small businesses. (Applause.) You are part of the backbone of America's economy. And that's the work we will do.
We will do the work of lowering health care costs, because I believe — I believe so deeply and strongly access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. (Applause.)
It's about values. It's about values.
On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face are the same as they were last time: another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires and the biggest corporations, and this time, he will pay for it with a 20 percent national sales tax on everything that you buy that is imported — clothes, food, toys, cell phones. A Trump sales tax that would cost the average American family — economists have — have measured it — more than $4,000 a year that you are not paying you would have to pay because of that tax.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on top of that, as we have discussed, he still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — which would throw millions of people, millions of Americans, off of their health insurance and take us back to the time when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was?
Well, you are correct: We are —
AUDIENCE: Not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — not going back. We are not going back. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we are not going back because, just like Wisconsin's state motto tells us, we will move forward. (Applause.) We will move forward. You guys know that best.
So, ours — ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom, like the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
And we remember how we got here. Donald Trump, when he was president, hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. They did as he intended, and now over 20 states have a Trump abortion ban.
Imagine, in America today, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral.
And Donald Trump is not done. He would ban abortion nationwide — yes, even here in Wisconsin, were that to happen — and he would restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states — get this — to monitor women's pregnancies.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Just google Project 2025, which I still can't believe they put in writing. (Laughter.)
And let us agree, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn't be telling her what to do — (applause) — not the government. Not the government. Not the government.
And when Congress — and when Congress, together with Tammy's leadership, passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) I will proudly sign it into law.
So, Wisconsin, I am asking for your vote. (Applause.) I am asking for your vote. And here is my pledge to you — here is my pledge to you.
As president, I pledge to seek common ground and commonsense solutions to the challenges you face. (Applause.)
I pledge that I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. (Applause.)
And I pledge — I pledge to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make. I will listen to experts. I will listen to the people who disagree with me. Because, you see, unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy. (Applause.) He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. (Applause.) That's what a democracy is about. That's what leaders do. (Applause.)
And it is my pledge to always put country above party and self and to be a president for all Americans — (applause) — for all Americans. That is my pledge to you, Wisconsin.
So, let me ask — we're four days out — who here has already voted? (Applause.) Oh, wow! (Laughs.) Oh, my goodness. That's great. Thank you. (Laughs.)
Okay. Well, here's what I want to ask — I want to ask a little more of you. Please talk to your friends and family, neighbors, and — and share your perspective. Share — share why you have taken the time out of your lives to spend this time here when there's so many other things you could do. Let them know, because this moment, I think, really is our opportunity to reconnect with people and remind them they're not alone and build community. And so, please, share with them why this election is important to you and encourage them to make their voices heard.
And for anyone who's not yet voted, no judgment — (laughter) — but please take a moment now to just think about what your plan will be for when and where you will vote, and please go to IWillVote.com — yes, I have a website — (laughter) — for all the information you might need about when and where you can go to vote and where to drop off your absentee ballot. (Applause.)
And, Wisconsin, truly, we need everyone to vote here. You, Wisconsin, are going to make the difference in this election. (Applause.) You will make the difference. You will make the difference.
And so, it all comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. We love our country. And when you love something, you fight for it. (Applause.) And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism, an expression of our love of our country, to then fight for the ideals of our country. That's what this is about. And it is fighting for the promise of America.
And I'll tell you, I have always believed in our nation's promise, because I have lived it. I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents took me to the marches when I was in a stroller, and there were people there from every walk of life who came together to fight for freedom and for opportunity.
Growing up, I saw how hard my mother worked to raise my sister and me and to give us the same chances that our country gave her. And I was blessed to have family by blood and family by love who — (applause) — who instilled in me — you know what I'm talking about — and instilled in me the values of community and compassion and faith.
And I've spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and who have been counted out but who never stopped believing, in our country, that anything is possible.
I have lived the promise of America, and I see the promise of America in everyone who is here, in all of us — in all of us — in all of us. (Applause.) This is the promise of America.
This is the promise of America: In the fathers and mothers and grandparents who work hard every day for the future of their children; in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom — (applause) — and in the men who support them — (applause); in Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before but are putting the Constitution of the United States above party. (Applause.) Right?
The promise of America is all around us. It is in the young leaders who are voting for the very first time. (Applause.) Where are you? Where are you? (Laughs.) (Applause.) Oh, I love Gen Z. I really do. (Laughs.)
You know what I love about this generation? You all are rightly impatient for change. (Applause.) You know? You are determined to live free from gun violence, to take on the climate crisis. (Applause.) You guys are going to shape the world you inherit. And for this generation, there — none of these issues is theoretical for them. It's not political for them.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We live it!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: For you all, it is a lived experience. (Applause.) It is a lived experience. That's right. And I see you, and I see your power. And I am so proud of you when I think about the future of our nation. So, can we hear it for our first-time voters? (Applause.)
Right. Right. Right.
All right. So, Wisconsin, four days — four days to get this thing done. And no one can sit on the sidelines. Let's spend the next four days so that when we look back on these four days, we have no regrets that we did everything that we could. (Applause.)
So, let's knock on doors. Let's text and call voters. Let's reach out to family and friends and classmates and neighbors and coworkers. And as we do, please, I do ask you, let us be intentional about building community. (Applause.) Let us be intentional about building coalitions. (Applause.) Let us remind each other and others that we have so much more in common than what separates us. (Applause.)
Let us do that. There is power in that. It will strengthen our country. And we'll remind folks, also: Your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. It is your power. (Applause.)
And so, Wisconsin, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. And God bless the United States. God bless you. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Atlanta, Georgia
  


  

  
    November 02, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hello, Georgia! (Applause.) Oh, it's good to be back.
Can we hear for Justin? (Applause.)
All right, Atlanta. Are we ready to do this? (Applause.) Are we ready to vote? (Applause.) Are we ready to win? (Applause.)
Oh, it's good to be back. It's good to be back and to be with so many leaders. And I want to thank everyone here for, out of your busy lives, taking time to be here to have this conversation. I thank you so very much. (Applause.) Everyone who is here, I thank you.
And I want to thank Senators Ossoff and Warnock. (Applause.) There's Senator Warnock.
Representatives Williams, McBath, Johnson — (applause) — they're all here.
Mayor Dickens. (Applause.)
Victoria Monét. (Applause.)
Monica. (Applause.)
Spike. (Applause.)
And let's give it up for Pastor Troy and 2 Chainz. (Applause.)
All right, Georgia. So, we have three days left — three days — in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime, and we still have work to do. We still have work to do.
But here's the thing. We like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And make no mistake, we will win. We will win. (Applause.)
And we will win because when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. (Applause.)
And, Georgia, we have an opportunity in this election to finally turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump, who spends full time trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done. We're done with that. We are exhausted with that. Enough of that. (Applause.) Enough.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we are not going back, and one of the reasons is because we do know the contrast. And we know who he is, but, Atlanta, that's not who we are. That's not who we are.
And it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. (Applause.) And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States of America. (Applause.)
And, Georgia, you know me: I'm not afraid of tough fights, evidently. (Laughs.) For decades, I was a prosecutor. I was the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state. And I won fights against the big banks who ripped off homeowners, against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students, against predators who abused women and children, against cartels that trafficked in guns and drugs and human beings. (Applause.) I won those fights.
And I pledge to you, if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way. (Applause.)
And, look, we know who Donald Trump is.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And — and — because we know this is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is increasingly unstable —
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — obsessed with revenge —
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — consumed with grievance —
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and the man is out for unchecked power.
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And in less than 90 days, it's either going To be him or me in the Oval Office. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And here's the thing — so, help spread the word, because part of it is to help people imagine — you can imagine in your mind that th- — the Oval Office, right? You can picture it. We've seen it on TV. So, just imagine, if he is elected, on day one, Donald Trump would walk in that Oval Office with his enemies list — stewing over an enemy's list.
When I am elected, I will walk in on your behalf with my to-do list — (applause) — my to-do list.
And at the top of my list is bringing down the cost of living for you — (applause) — and that will be my focus every single day as president.
I will give a middle-class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. (Applause.) I will enact the first-ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries. (Applause.)
We need a medic over here, please. We need a medic over here. If everyone can just part a little bit so we can let somebody through. Okay?
Okay. All right. See, this is what we do. We look out for each other, right? (Applause.) That's how we roll. That's how we roll. And that's what leadership looks like: everybody here. (Applause.)
And among the things also on my to-do list is to fight to make sure that hardworking Americans can actually afford a place to live. Affordable housing: one of the highest priorities. (Applause.)
My priorities include knowing that if you are caring for an elderly parent, we need to cover the cost of home care with Medicare — (applause) — which we will do, because I've been there. I took care of my mother when she was sick. I know what that is — what that work is. It is about trying to cook something someone feels like eating. It is about trying to help them put on their clothes. It's about trying to put a smile on their face or make them laugh from time to time.
It's hard work, and it's work that is about dignity. And it is not right that the current situation is such that you'd either have to spend down your savings to qualify for Medicaid or quit your job to be able to take care of a family member, especially if you are in the sandwich generation, which means taking care of your children while you're taking care of your parent. (Applause.)
A lot of what motivates me in my work is it's about dignity — the dignity of all people, that all people deserve that dignity to be able to not just get by but get ahead — (applause) — which is why my plan will also lower the cost of childcare. (Applause.)
We will cut taxes for small businesses. (Applause.) Do we have any small businesses in the house? (Applause.) Oh, I love our small businesses. You all are the backbone of America's economy.
We will lower health care costs, because I believe health care should be a right and not just the privilege of those who can afford it. (Applause.)
On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face are the same as they were the last time: another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires and the biggest corporations.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And this time, he would pay for it with a 20 percent national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported.
And it looks like we need a medic over there. It's hot out here, Atlanta.
Let's make sure we — again, everyone just try and part the way so someone can come through to help.
All right, we're good.
So, talking about Trump's plan — because, you know, economists have compared what he's talking about to what I'm talking about, and they have indicated my plan will strengthen America's economy. His will weaken it, including the part about his ""Trump sales tax"" that would cost the average American family over 4,000 more dollars a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on top of that, Donald Trump still is trying to get rid of — and still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — which would throw millions of Americans off health care and take us back to the time insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was?
Well, we are not —
AUDIENCE: Going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — going back. We are not going back.
And we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future. (Applause.) And ours is a fight for freedom — (applause) — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
And we remember how we got here. When he was president, Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention they would undo the rights under Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended. And, Atlanta, now, in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, including Georgia and every state in the south except Virginia —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — many with no exceptions for rape and incest, which is immoral.
And, look, Donald Trump is not done. He will ban abortion nationwide. He wants to restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force — get this — force states to monitor women's pregnancies.
Just google Project 2025. Look it up for yourself.
And let us agree, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn't tell her what to do — (applause) — not the government. Not the government.
And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly sign it into law.
So, Georgia, I am here to ask for your vote. (Applause.) I am here to ask for your vote. And here — and here is my pledge to you. As president, I pledge to seek common ground and commonsense solutions to the challenges you face. I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. (Applause.)
I pledge to you to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make. I pledge to you to listen to experts and to listen to people who disagree with me, because unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I will give them a seat at the table. (Applause.) That's what real leaders do. (Applause.) That's what strong leaders do. (Applause.)
And I pledge to you to always put country above party and self, and I pledge to you to be a president for all Americans. (Applause.)
So, that is my pledge to you, Atlanta. And let me ask, anybody here already voted? (Applause.) Oh, wow. My — oh, my goodness. Well, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. All right.
So — okay, but there's more to do. So, now, please just talk to your friends and your neighbors and your coworkers and your classmates and your family and share your perspective on why this election is so important. Let them know why you decided to take this time out of your life, with your obligations, to be here together. And encourage them, please, to make their voices heard.
And for those who haven't voted yet, let me just be clear, no judgment. No judgment. But you still have time. (Laughs.) So, please take a moment to think about right now what your plan will be for when and where you vote.
Election Day is Tuesday, November 5th. Polls are open here in Georgia from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Remember to bring your photo ID. Go to IWillVote.com for all the information you need. And, everyone, please help me spread the word on all of that — (applause) — because we need everyone in Georgia to vote. You will make the difference in this election. (Applause.) You will make the difference.
So, look, it all comes down to this. We are all here together from all different kinds of walks of life. We are all here together for one reason that we share in common — one of the most important reasons. We are here because we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country. And we know that when you love something, you fight for it. (Applause.)
And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism, of our expression of our love for our country, to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. That's what this is about.
And I will tell you, I have always believed in our nation's promise, because I have lived it. I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents would take me to the marches when I was in a stroller. And there were people there from — Atlanta knows the story. There were people there from all walks of life, coming together to fight for freedom and for opportunity.
You know, growing up, I saw how hard my mother worked to give her daughters the same chances our country gave her. I was blessed growing up to have family by blood and to have family by love — (applause) — who instilled in me the values of community, of compassion, of faith.
I've spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out but who never stop believing that in our country anything is possible. (Applause.)
I have lived the promise of America. And today, I see the promise of America in everyone who is here right now — (applause) — in all of you, in all of us. We are the promise of America. (Applause.) We are the promise of America.
It is in the fathers, in the mothers, in the grandparents who work hard every day for our children's future. It is the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom and the men who support them. (Applause.) In Republicans who never voted for a Democrat before but put the Constitution above party. (Applause.)
I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the very first time. (Applause.) Raise your hand. Where are you? I love Gen Z. I love Gen Z. (Applause.) Oh. Because, see, this generation, you are rightly impatient for change. You are rightly impatient for change. You are determined to live free from gun violence and tackle the climate crisis and shape the world you inherit.
For this generation, none of these issues we're talking about are theoretical or political. It is a lived experience for you. And I see your power, and I am so proud of you.
And to everyone, can we hear it for our first-time voters? (Applause.) That's right. That's right.
So, Atlanta, we have three days to get this thing done — (applause) — and no one can sit on the sidelines. Let's spend the next three days knowing that when we look back on these three days, we will have no regrets about what we could have done. So, let's knock on doors. Let's text. Let's call voters. Let's reach out to family and friends and classmates and neighbors and coworkers and your play cousins. Let's reach out. (Laughs.)
And as we do, let us please also be intentional in how we build community. Let us be intentional in knowing that these last years of this Trump era, yes, they have been exhausting, but they have not been in the best interest of the strength of our nation. This whole idea that we be pointing fingers at each other, the idea that we have nothing in common when we know the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.
So, let's be intentional about building community and building coalitions. There is power in that, and it will strengthen our country. (Applause.)
And let's remind everybody that your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. (Applause.)
So, Georgia, today, I ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —

And we have an opportunity, in this election, to turn the page — (applause) — on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done with that. We're done. (Applause.) We're exhausted with it. We're done.
And we know who he is. We know who he is. He tells us every day — (laughter) — but, Charlotte, that's not who we are. (Applause.) That's not who we are.
And we know it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. (Applause.) And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States of America. (Applause.)
And, North Carolina, here is the thing. You know me. You know me. I'm not afraid of tough fights. (Applause.) For decades, as a prosecutor and a top law enforcement officer of the biggest state in our country, I won fights against the big banks that ripped off homeowners. I won fights against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students, against predators who abused women and children. I won fights against the cartels that traffic in guns and drugs and human beings. (Applause.)
And I pledge to you that if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way. (Applause.) Nothing.
And, look, we know who Donald Trump is. This is — so —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. We do, don't we?
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And here is one of the things we know about him. This is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. And this is someone who is increasingly unstable —
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — obsessed with revenge —
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — consumed with grievance —
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and the man is out for unchecked power. (Applause.)
So, look, in less than 90 days, it's either going to be him or me sitting in the Oval Office. (Applause.) We're going to do this. (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Inaudible.) Thank you, thank you, thank you.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, he- — thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Okay. (Applause.) Come on. Thank you. Okay, okay. Thank you. (Applause.) (Laughs.)
But — okay, but — so, how about sharing with your friends, right? So, this is the thing that we want to share with folks, just to imagine — right? — what this means and the — the choice that is in front of us. Imagine — and let's ask the friends who are not here to imagine the Oval Office. You've seen it on T.V., right? Imagine the Oval Office. And if he is elected, Donald Trump, on day one, would be sitting in that office, stewing over his enemies list.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: But when I am elected, I will walk in, on your behalf, working on my to-do list — (applause) — to-do.
And at the top of my list is bringing down the cost of living for you. (Applause.) That will be my focus every single day as president.
I will give a middle-class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. (Applause.) I will enact the first-ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries — (applause); fight to make sure that hardworking Americans can actually afford a place to live. (Applause.) And if you are caring for an elderly parent, my plan will cover the cost of home care under Medicare. (Applause.)
(A protestor disruption can be heard.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's all good. It's all good.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's all good. You know what? One of the reasons — one of the reasons we are here is because we are fighting for our democracy — (applause) — and the right of people to speak their mind. But right now, I am speaking. (Applause.)
So, bringing down the cost of living for you includes making sure that we are caring for those who are caring for others.
AUDIENCE: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's okay, y'all. Democracy can be complicated. It's all right. (Applause.) It's all right. It's all right. (Laughs.) This is what democracy looks like. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
So, included in the work we will do is ensuring that Medicare covers the cost of home health care for seniors. And I'll tell you, a lot of how I think about these policies is based on my own experiences.
When my mother was — when my mother was sick, I took care of her.
(A protestor disruption can be heard.)
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's all right.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's all good. It's all good.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's all good. Hey, listen, it's all good.
And, look, we all want that war in the Middle East to end. We want the hostages home. (Applause.) And when I am president, I will do everything in my power to make it so.
So, so much about what I care about on your behalf is truly about dignity. It is about dignity. It is about the importance of lifting people up and not trying to tear them down — (applause) — which is why my plan will lower the cost of childcare, cut taxes for small businesses.
Do we have small-business owners in the h- — (applause). Here we do. I love our small businesses. You all are part of the big backbone of America's economy. Keep doing what you do. I love our small businesses. (Applause.) You are.
And our work will include lowering health care costs, because where I come from, in terms of how I think about this, access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. (Applause.)
On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face? Same as it was last time: another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And this time, he will pay for it with a 20 percent national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported: clothes, food, toys, cell phones. A Trump sales tax that economists have estimated will cost you an additional $4,000 a year.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on top of that, Donald Trump still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — which would throw millions of Americans off their health insurance and take us back to the time when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was?
Well, we are not —
AUDIENCE: Going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — going back. We are not going back. (Applause.) (Inaudible.) We are not going back. We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. And we are not — and we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future. (Applause.) And it is a fight for freedom — (applause) — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
And we all remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and — with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. They did as he intended. And now, in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, including North Carolina and every state in the South, except Virginia —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral.
And understand, Donald Trump is not done. He would ban abortion nationwide. He would restrict access to birth control. He would put IVF treatments at risk and — get this — force states to monitor women's pregnancies.
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Just google Project 2025, which still I can't believe they put in writing. (Laughter.)
And I think everyone here knows: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn't be telling her what to do. (Applause.) Not the government, and not Donald Trump.
And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly. Proudly.
So, North Carolina, I'm here to ask for your vote. (Applause.) I'm here to ask for your vote.
And here — and here is my pledge to you. As president, I pledge to seek common ground and commonsense solutions to the challenges you face. (Applause.)
I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. (Applause.)
And I pledge to you to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make. I pledge to you to listen to experts, to listen to people who disagree with me — (applause) — because, you see, unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I will give them a seat at the table. (Applause.)
That's what real leadership looks like. That's what strong leadership looks like. (Applause.) Come on.
And I pledge to always put country above party and self and to be a president for all Americans. (Applause.)
So, that is my pledge to you, Charlotte.
And let me then ask, who here has already voted? (Applause.) Wow. All right. Well, I thank you. (Laughs.)
So, now I'm going to ask you, just please talk to your friends and your family and your neighbors. And, seriously, please share with them — you've taken such time out of all the other ob- — obligations you have. You've taken such time to be here. So, please do share with them why you have taken this time and what your perspective is on this election. It's so important.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And please encourage people — I love you back. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
And let's — let's encourage everyone to know the strength of their voice.
And for anyone who hasn't voted yet, look, first of all, no judgment, but — but please do get to it. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
And — and please take a moment to think about your plan for voting, about when and where you will vote. Election Day is Tuesday, November 5th. Polls are open here in North Carolina from 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. (Applause.)
Go to IWillVote.com for any information you need about when and where to vote, because, listen, we need everyone to vote, North Carolina. (Applause.) You all will make the difference in this election. You will make the difference.
So, look, it all comes down to this. We are all here together because we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country.
AUDIENCE: USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We love our country.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And here's what we know — here's what we all know: When you love something, you fight for it. (Applause.) You fight for it.
And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism, of our love — the expression of our love for our country, to fight for its ideals and to fight to realize the promise of America — the promise of America. (Applause.)
And, look, I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it. I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents — (applause) — my parents would take me to the marches when I was in a stroller. And what we all know about that time is there were folks from every background, every walk of life, coming together to fight for freedom and for opportunity. (Applause.) Right?
And growing up, I saw how hard my mother worked to give her daughters the same chances our country gave her. And I was blessed to have family by blood and family by love — (applause) — who instilled in me the values of community and compassion and faith. And I have spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out but who never stop believing that, in our country, anything is possible. (Applause.)
I have lived the promise of America, and today I see the promise of America in everybody who is here — in all of you, in all of us. (Applause.) We are the promise of America. We are the promise of America, in the fathers and the mothers and the grandparents who work every day for our children's future, in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom — (applause) — and the men who support them. (Applause.)
I see it — I see it in Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before but who are putting Constitution of the United States over party. (Applause.)
I see the promise of America every day in the young leaders who are voting for the first time. (Applause.) Where are you? Where are you? Let me see you. Right? I love you guys. I love Gen Z. I love Gen Z. (Laughs.) (Applause.) I — I love this generation.
And because, you know, here's the thing: You all are rightly impatient for change. (Applause.) They are impatient for change. You are determined to live free from gun violence, to take on the climate crisis, and to shape the world you will inherit. (Applause.) I know that.
And for this generation, none of these issues is theoretical. These issues are not political. This is a lived experience for you all. And I see you, and I see your power, and I see your purpose. And I am so proud of you. Can we hear it for the first-time voters? (Applause.) Yeah. Right? See?
I'm telling you, the future of our nation is bright. It is bright. We have so much to be optimistic about.
So, we got three days to get this done. (Laughs.) (Applause.) And no one can sit on the sidelines.
AUDIENCE: No!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Let's spend the next three days so when we look back three days from now, we will have no regrets about what we could have done. (Applause.) Let's knock on doors. Let's text. Let's call. Reach out to your family, your friends, your classmates, your neighbors, your coworkers, your play cousins. (Laughter.) You know what I'm saying.
And please, during the course of these next three days, I ask, let us please be intentional about building community. (Applause.) Let us be intentional about building community.
You know, there's something about this whole Trump era that really was to try and suggest that the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down, instead of what we know: The real strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. (Applause.)
Let's be intentional about building community, and let's be intentional about building coalitions, remembering that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. (Applause.) And there is power in that. There is power in that approach, and it will strengthen our country.
And so, I'll leave you with this. Let's remember and please remind everyone: Your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. (Applause.) And don't let anyone ever take your power from you. (Applause.) Right?
So, North Carolina, today, I ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win! (Applause.)
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. God bless you. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President on a Campaign Call with Win With Black Women
  


  

  
    November 03, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Can you hear me?
MS. MOORE: Yes, we can hear you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Minyon?
MS. MOORE: Yes, ma'am.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi — thank — (laughs). Good evening, everyone. Good evening.
Yes, I am on the tarmac. I just landed back from East Lansing, Michigan, in Detroit. Yesterday, I was in five states. Tomorrow, I'm heading to Pennsylvania. I'll be in Pittsburgh. I'll be in Philly and Allentown.
And two days to go. And I just wanted to get on the call to thank everybody for just all the — everything: for the work; the prayers, the prayers, the prayers; for the friendship; for the sisterhood.
Jotaka, I thank you for all you've been doing to organize. Minyon, I just thank you for just being my sister and — and my dear, dear close friend.
And, everyone, thank you. Win With Black Women — this coalition has been in my corner for the last four years and, just four months ago, immediately jumped into action with this weekly call to be the first group to organize tens of thousands of Black women in support of our brand new campaign.
And I just — I'm so thankful, because you were the catalyst. When others saw how the leaders on this call organize and — and empower and mobilize, then they, too, said, ""Hey, we should do it."" And — and I know that the leaders here, including and starting with Jotaka, helped other groups to organize to replicate what Win With Black Women has been doing for years now.
And I just thank everyone. I thank everyone for building a coalition that has been hard at work to support our campaign — many of those coalition members who are also on this call.
And at the heart of our coalition-building is our core understanding that we all have so much more in common than what separates us, that we are all in this together, and that we can have an impact on people's lives, that we know it is our calling. We are driven by our faith to know that we must live a life of service in some way, whether it be because we choose to be in public office or in other ways.
But it is about lifting people up and reminding them that we are a community of people who care and have so much to be optimistic about.
So, I thank everyone on this call for being such a part of this people-powered movement.
And two days away from the election, I know people on this call have been out knocking on doors and calling folks and texting, and we have such momentum. I'm telling you. I just left East Lansing, and I was up at — at Michigan State, and these young people are just energized.
And there were people from every generation of life, every walk of life, coming together under one roof, around a common purpose, and that is about dedicating ourselves to a new generation of leadership, and it's about the future of our country and doing it with optimism.
So, I thank you all. We have more work to do. And I know everyone here has probably voted early, but I do need your help to make sure that all our family and friends get to the polls. And let's mobilize our Facebook groups, our family group chats, and everyone we know.
And I'll just close by saying again: I'm so thankful and grateful to everybody here and for this incredible sisterhood. And we will get this done, we will win, and it will be because we know what's at stake, we love our country, and we know how to fight for all that is good and important for the future.
So, I thank you, everybody. Minyon, again, thank you for the introduction. And, everybody, be well. I'll see you out there. Thank you.

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in East Lansing, Michigan
  


  

  
    November 03, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hello, Michigan! (Applause.) Hi, everyone.
Can we hear it for Sedrick? (Applause.)
All right. We're going to do this.
Hello, Michigan State! (Applause.) It is good to be in the house of my dear friend Magic Johnson. Go Green! (Applause.)
AUDIENCE: Go White! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: All right. All right. East Lansing, are we ready to do this? (Applause.)
Are we ready to vote? (Applause.)
Are we ready to win? (Applause.)
Oh, it's good to be back in Michigan and to be with so many incredible leaders. I want to thank Lieutenant Governor Gilchrist — (applause); Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, and let's send her to the United States Senate — (applause); and Curtis Hertel, and let's send him to the U.S. House of Representatives. (Applause.)
And we are joined today by leaders of the Arab American community, which has deep and proud roots here in Michigan. (Applause.)
And I want to say this year has been difficult, given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza and given the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon. It is devastating. And as president, I will do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza, t- — (applause) — to bring home the hostages, end the suffering in Gaza, ensure Israel is secure, and ensure the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, freedom, security, and self-determination. (Applause.)
And we continue to work on a diplomatic resolution across the Israel-Lebanon border to protect civilians and provide lasting stability. (Applause.) And as president, I will work tirelessly toward a future with security and dignity for all people. (Applause.)
So, Michigan, two days to go — (applause) — are you ready? Are you ready? — in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. And we have momentum. It is on our side. Can you feel it? (Applause.)
And we have the momentum because our campaign is tapping into the ambitions, the aspirations, and the dreams of the American people, because we are optimistic and excited about what we can do together — (applause) — and because we know it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. (Applause.) And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States. (Applause.)
Now, the race is not yet over, and we need to finish strong. So, for the next two days, we still have a lot of work to do. But here's the thing: We like hard work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work. (Applause.) Hard work is joyful work. (Applause.)
And make no mistake, we will win. (Applause.) We will win.
We will win. We will win.
And we will win — and w- — (laughs).
AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we — and we will win because here's what everyone here knows: When you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. (Applause.)
And we have an opportunity in this election to finally turn the page on a decade of politics driven by fear and division. We are done with that, and we are exhausted with it. (Applause.) And America is ready — America is ready for a fresh start, ready for a new way forward, where we see our fellow American not as an enemy but as a neighbor. (Applause.)
We are ready for a president who knows that the true measure of a leader is not based on who you beat down; it is based on who you lift up. (Applause.)
And, Michigan, you know me. I am not afraid of tough fights, evidently. (Laughs.) (Applause.) For decades as a prosecutor and the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state, I won fights against the big banks that ripped off homeowners. (Applause.) I won fights against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students. I won fights against creditors who abused women, children, and seniors. (Applause.) I won fights — I won fights against the cartels that trafficked in guns, drugs, and human beings. (Applause.)
And — and it is my pledge to you, if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way. (Applause.) I'm here for you.
And I will get up every day to fight to make your life better, to bring down the cost of living, to ban corporate price gouging on groceries, to make housing and childcare more affordable. (Applause.)
My plan will cut taxes for workers, for middle-class families, and small businesses — (applause); lower health care costs, including the cost of homecare for seniors — (applause) — because, by the way, I believe health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. (Applause.)
And to those certain individuals who still want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and take us back to the days when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions, well, you all know what we say: We are —
AUDIENCE: Not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — not going back. (Laughs.) (Applause.) We are not going back.
We are not going back because ours is a fight for the future. (Applause.) And it is a fight for freedom — (applause) — including the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide — (applause) — you know where I'm going — as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.)
So, Michigan, I am here to ask for your vote. I am here to ask for your vote. (Applause.) And here — and here is my pledge to you. As president, I pledge to seek common ground and commonsense solutions to the challenges you face.
I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. (Applause.)
And I pledge to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make. I pledge to listen to experts. And I pledge to listen to people who disagree with me — (applause) — because, you see, I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy. (Applause.) In fact, I'll give them a seat at the table because that's what strong leaders do. (Applause.)
And I pledge to always put country above party and self and to be a president for all Americans — (applause) — all Americans.
So, that is my pledge to you, East Lansing. And let me then ask: Who here has already voted? (Applause.) Oh, that's fantastic. Thank you. (Laughs.) (Applause.) All right. Okay.
Well, now — now I've got to ask you: Please talk to your friends and family and neighbors — (laughter) — and share your perspective on why this election is so important. Share your perspective on why, with the many, many other things you could be doing with your time right now, you took time out of your busy lives to be here. Let's connect with each other and let folks know and encourage them to make their voices heard.
And for those of you who haven't voted yet, no judgment — no judgment. (Laughter.) But please do take a moment — (laughs) — and think about your plan for when and where you will vote. Election Day is on Tuesday, November 5th. (Applause.)
Polls are open here in Michigan from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. (Applause.) And if you are not yet registered to vote, you can register and vote at your local clerk's office now through Election Day. (Applause.)
It's a very big deal. It's a very big deal.
So, go to IWillVote.com for all the information you need, including when and where to vote and where to drop off your absentee ballot. But we need everyone to vote in Michigan. You will make the difference in this election. (Applause.) You will make the difference. You will make the difference.
So —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I love you back. (Applause.) I love you back.
So — so —
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay. So, here's the thing. It all comes down to this. We are here together, this incredible mix of people from every background, every stage of life, under one roof together. And we are here together for many reasons, including because we love our country. We love our country. (Applause.) We love our country.
And when you love something, you fight for it. (Applause.) You fight for it.
And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism, the expression of the love we have for our country, to then fight for its ideals and to fight to realize the promise of America. That's what we are about. (Applause.) That's what we are about.
And I have always believed in our nation's promise, because I have lived it. So, I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents would take me to the marches when I was in a stroller. And there were people there — and history has told us, there were people there from every walk of life, coming together to fight for freedom and for opportunity.
You know, growing up, I saw how hard our mother worked to give her daughters the same chances our country gave her. And I was blessed to have family by blood and to have family by love — (applause) — who instilled in me — who instilled in me the values of community, compassion, and faith.
I have spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out but who never stopped believing that, in our country, anything is possible.
I have lived the promise of America, and I will tell you, today, I see the promise of America in everyone who is here — in all of you, in all of us. We are the promise of America. (Applause.) We are. You are. We are the promise of America.
And I see it in the fathers and the mothers and the grandparents who work hard every day for their children's future. I see it in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom. (Applause.) I see it in the men that support them. (Applause.) I see it in Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before but have put the Constitution of the United States above party. (Applause.)
And I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are here and voting for the first time. (Applause.) I love Gen Z. (Laughs.) (Applause.) I do. I do.
And here's one of the things that I love about this generation — you, this incredible generation. You all — you all are rightly impatient for change. (Applause.) I know that. I know that. I know that about you.
And here's the thing, because you all have only known the climate crisis and are leading, then, the charge to protect our planet and our future. You, who grew up with active shooter drills and are fighting to keep our schools safe. (Applause.) You, who know — now know fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers, are standing up for freedom.
None of these issues for you are theoretical. This is not political for you all. This is your lived experience. And I see you. (Applause.) And I see your power. And I am so proud of you.
Can we hear it for our first-time voters? (Applause.) Right? Yeah. I'm telling you, this is why I know our future is bright. I'm just so optimistic about it. I'm so optimistic about it. (Applause.)
So — all right. All right. Two days — we got two days to get this done. (Applause.) And nobody can sit on the sidelines. Let's spend the next two days so that when we look back, we have no regrets that we did everything we could.
So, let's knock on doors. Let's text. Let's call the voters. Let's reach out to family, friends, classmates, neighbors, coworkers.
And as we do, I have one request on top of everything else I've asked of you. (Laughter.) Let's be true to what our campaign has been about from the very start, which is to be intentional about building community. (Applause.) Let's build community while we are doing this. Let's build community and be intentional about it. Let's be intentional about building coalitions.
Because we know, look, there's been so much about this last decade that is just — but it's — it's — but the thing is is that it — the tenor of it has been to try and make people feel alone, to make people — and, you know, when you make people feel alone, it's a way of trying to disempower people, to suggest to them you don't have people, to suggest to them you don't have community, which is not true.
And that's why I say, let's be intentional about in the face of a stranger, seeing a neighbor, and understanding that our power to lift each other up is immense. And let us do it with the spirit of knowing the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. (Applause.)
And we are all in this together. (Applause.) We are all in this together. Because, you know, from the very start, our campaign has not been about being against something; it is about being for something — (applause) — a fight for a future with freedom, opportunity, and dignity for all Americans.
And so, in these final hours, let us remember that there is power in knowing that we are together. And let us remember that your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. (Applause.) And you are powerful, and you remember that.
So, today, Michigan, I ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win. (Applause.)
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Scranton, Pennsylvania
  


  

  
    November 04, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Scranton! (Applause.) Hey, everybody!
Can we hear it for Glen? (Applause.) Let's hear it for Glen.
Hi, Scranton. Good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon. It is so good to be with everyone. (Applause.) Thank you.
Are we ready to do this?
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We- — we're ready to get out the vote?
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're ready to win?
AUDIENCE: Yes!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: All right. Okay. So, first, let me thank Glen. I was — I was telling him when we were just hanging out backstage, so when I — my first office that I ran for was district attorney, and the Carpenters were the first union to endorse me. (Applause.) And — and I — and I've always — I mean, even before, but always — I will always and always have stood with labor.
And so, I'm very proud to stand with you, Glen, with your members, with all the members of labor, as we do this together. (Applause.)
And as he pointed out, there's a huge difference between me and the other guy, which everybody here knows, which is why you are here to help us get out the vote. (Applause.)
But I thought I would share with you — so, I was — when I was coming in, someone reminded me of — of a story I've shared, which is when I first ran for office as DA. So, I — I started out at six points in the polls, right? So, you kn- — for anyone who knows, that's 6 out of 100. (Laughter.) No one thought we could win. And I used to campaign with my ironing board. (Laughter.) Okay. You are wondering, ""Now, what is she talking about?"" (Laughter.)
So, I would grab my ironing board, a roll of duct tape, my pois- — my posters and my flyers, and I'd put them all in my car, and I'd drive to the local grocery stores. And I'd pull out my ironing board and my duct tape and my posters and my flyers, and I'd walk to the front of the grocery store outside, and I'd stand up my ironing board, because, you see, an ironing board makes a really great standing desk. (Laughter.)
And I'd use the duct tape to tape my posters on the outside of the thing, and I'd put my flyers on top of the ironing board. And I would require people to talk to me as they walked in and out of the grocery store. (Laughter.)
And I will tell you, that is how I love to campaign. I don't do it as much anymore, obviously. But what you all are signing up to do today and what you've been doing, like, let's enjoy it. You know, and I know you do. I can feel the mood in here. Because it's the best of who we are as a democracy.
And I think we've kind of — (applause) — right?
And that's what our campaign has been about. We are a people-driven campaign, and we love the people. And we see, in the face of a stranger, a neighbor — right? — and that's the spirit of what we are doing.
And over these last — you know, this whole era of this other guy, you know, it — but it — what it's done with all that talk that's been about trying to have us point fingers at each other and divide each other, it makes people feel alone. It makes them feel like there's nobody standing with them.
And so, the way I have always been thinking about our campaign and these next 24 hours is as we are getting out the vote, as we are canvassing, let's be intentional about building community — about building community, about building coalitions, about reminding people we all have so much more in common than what separates us. There is power in that. There is power in that. (Applause.) And there's lasting power in that, right?
It's about the win, and it is about more. It is about more. It is about just strengthening our country and reminding each other we are all in this together. We rise and fall together. And that is the strength of who we are and everyone here.
That's the strength of Bob Casey. We've got to get him back in the United States Senate. (Applause.)
That's the strength of Mayor Cognetti and all that she has been doing. Right? (Applause.)
It's about leadership that is the kind of leadership that we want. Right? They are leaders, we are leaders who understand that the measure of our strength is not based on who we beat down. It's based on who we lift up. Right? (Applause.) And so, that's what we're going to do.
And so, over these next 24 hours, I know everyone is here, including our youngest leaders — I see you over there. I know you're not ready to vote because you look like you're about eight, but — (laughs) — but you tell the adults in your life why it's important they vote. Okay? (Laughs.) (Applause.)
But over these next 24 hours, let's — let's enjoy this moment to knock on a neighbor's door and in their face, even if we've not met them, know that we have a lot that we care about in common and that we are optimistic about the future of our country, that we love our country, and that that's what this fight is about, and about the promise of America — and the promise of America being represented by everybody who is here.
So, I thank you all for the time that you have taken out of your busy lives. There are a number of things that each one of you could be doing right now and — but you're here, and we're all here together, under this one roof, as a community of people who care and who are dedicated to the hard work that it requires.
You know, I — I like to say that you — you know, when you love something, you fight for it. (Applause.) And that's what we're doing. And that's what we're doing. We love our country, and we are fighting for the best of who we are. And —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I love you. (Applause.) Thank you. I love you.
So —
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Let's vote. Let's get out the vote. Let's get out the vote. Let's get out the vote.
AUDIENCE: Let's get out the vote! Let's get out the vote! Let's get out the vote!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Let's get out the vote. Let's get out the vote. Let's get out the vote. Let's win. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
All right, let's get to work. Twenty-four hours to go. And I — I so — I — I'm so grateful for everyone here. I — I just — I'll end with this point. You know, I have the — I have the privilege, I have the blessing of being able to travel around our country. And I'm telling you guys, we're good. We're good. We're good. (Applause.) We really are.
I mean, every — I s- — I go into rooms with people who s- — again, seemingly have nothing in common and have everything in common — rooms of people of all kinds of different backgrounds, of ages coming together in this sense of just the — the collective. We're good.
And so, we're going to keep doing this work with the optimism that it requires to be strong. Everyone here knows, in the context of your family, in your life, when you believe something is possible, you put in the hard work, and you know it's good work — hard work is good work, it's joyful work — and we get the job done.
Let's get this done. Thank you all. (Applause.)

    Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
  


  

  
    November 04, 2024  

  
    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hello, Pittsburgh! (Applause.) Hey, everybody. Hi. (Applause.)
Can we hear it for Cedric the Entertainer? (Applause.)
Hey, everyone. (Applause.) (Laughs.)
We're doing this.
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Pittsburgh! (Applause.) Are we ready to do this? (Applause.)
Are we ready to vote? (Applause.)
Are we ready to win? (Applause.)
Oh, it is good to be here tonight with all these leaders. I thank you all so very much.
I want to thank Representatives Lee, Deluzio. Let's send them back to the U.S. House of Representatives. (Applause.)
Please send Bob Casey back to the United States Senate. (Applause.)
And I thank everyone for being here and taking the time out of your busy lives to be here this evening.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Madam V.P.!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I love you back. (Applause.) I
love you back. I love you back.
All right. So, Pittsburgh, this is it. Tomorrow is Election Day. (Applause.) Tomorrow is Election Day, and the momentum is on our side. (Applause.)
Our campaign has tapped into the ambitions, the aspirations, and the dreams of the American people. And we know it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. (Applause.) And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States. (Applause.)
But we still got some work to do, because, look, the race is not over, and we must finish strong.
So, listen, here's the thing about the hard work. We like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. (Applause.)
And make no mistake, we will win. (Applause.) We will win. We will win. We will win.
And we will win because when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. (Applause.) And we have an opportunity in this election to finally turn the page on a decade of politics driven by fear and division. We are done with that. We're done. (Applause.) We're done. We're exhausted with it.
And, Pittsburgh, we are not —
AUDIENCE: Going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — going back. We're not going back.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back.
And we are not going back because America is ready for a fresh start. (Applause.) And we are ready for a president who knows the true measure of a leader is not based on who you beat down; it is based on who you lift up. (Applause.)
And instead of stewing over an enemy's list, I will spend every day working on my to-do list — (applause) — full of priorities to improve your life, because ours is not a fight against something; it is a fight for something. (Applause.)
It is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom — (applause) — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body — (applause) — and not have her government tell her what to do.
And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly. Proudly.
So, America, I am asking for your vote. I am asking for your vote. (Applause.)
And here — and here is my pledge to you. As president, I pledge to seek common ground and commonsense solutions to the challenges you face.
I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. I pledge to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make.
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we are not going back.
And here's the thing, guys, we are fighting for a democracy. We are fighting for a democracy. (Applause.) And in a democracy, true leadership understands that the leader listens to the experts and listens to people who disagree with them. I will listen to people who disagree with me because I do not believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy. In fact, I will give them a seat at the table. (Applause.) That is what real leaders do. That is what strong leaders do. (Applause.)
And I pledge to always put country above party and self and to be a president for all Americans. (Applause.)
So, Pittsburgh, that is my pledge to you. And to you I ask, then, who here has a plan to vote? (Applause.) Fantastic. Okay, so help spread the word then. Polls are open here in Pennsylvania tomorrow from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. You know that. (Laughs.)
Go to IWillVote.com for all the information you need, including where and when to vote and where to drop off your mail ballot, because we need everyone to vote, Pennsylvania. You will make the difference in this election. (Applause.) You will make the difference.
And, friends, listen, we are all here together because we love our country. We love our country. And when you love something, you fight for it. (Applause.)
And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism —
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: We love you, Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I love you back. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Love you back.
And one of the highest forms of our love of our country is to then fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America.
So, Pittsburgh, listen, we got one day left to get this done. So, now we work to get out the vote. (Applause.) Let's reach out in these next 24 hours to family and friends and classmates and neighbors and coworkers.
And as we do that, let us really be true to what our campaign has been about from the very start. And on that, I say, please, let us be intentional about building community. (Applause.) Let us be intentional about building coalitions.
Because here is the thing. So much about these last several years has been about trying to make people point their fingers at each other, to have Americans point their fingers at each other, to try and make people feel alone or feel small. But let us do the work, as we work toward this win, of building up community and coalition and reminding everyone that we have so much more in common than what separates us. (Applause.) Let that be our goal.
And let us remind everyone, your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. (Applause.)
So, one last time, Pittsburgh, I ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. God bless you. God bless you. (Applause.)

Can we hear it for Elizabeth? (Applause.) Let's hear it for Elizabeth. (Applause.)
Good afternoon. All right, Allentown, are we ready to do this? (Applause.)
Are we ready to vote? (Applause.)
Are we ready to win? (Applause.)
All right. Oh, it's good to be back in Pennsylvania, and it is good to be with so many incredible leaders. Let me thank everyone.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I want to thank everyone — (applause) — I want to thank everyone for taking the time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon. We are all in this together, and I know we all here know this. But I thank you for all the work everyone has been doing over these last months —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you, Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and over the next 24 hours. (Applause.) Thank you all.
I want to thank my dear friend Governor Shapiro for his leadership — (applause) — his friendship, and all that he does. Congressman — Congresswoman Wild, let's reelect her — (applause) — to the United States House of Representatives. And while we're at it, please send Bob Casey back to the United States Senate. (Applause.)
Mayor Tuerk, I thank you for your friendship and your long-standing leadership. (Applause.)
And can we hear it for Fat Joe — (applause) — and Frankie Negrón? (Applause.)
So, listen, I am so thankful to everyone for being here and including the leaders of the Puerto Rican community. I stand — (applause) — I stand here proud of my long-standing commitment to Puerto Rico and her people, and I will be a president for all Americans. (Applause.) All Americans. All Americans.
So, Allentown, this is it. Just one more day. One more day. (Applause.) One more day left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime, and momentum is on our side. (Applause.) Momentum is on our side. Can you feel it? We have momentum, right? (Applause.)
Because our campaign has tapped into the ambitions and the aspirations and the dreams of the American people. We are optimistic and excited about what we will do together, and we here know it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. (Applause.) And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States of America. (Applause.)
Now, Pennsylvania, the race is not yet over. Okay? We got a lot of work to do, and we have got to finish strong.
So, listen, we got hard work to do. But here's the thing: We like hard work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work. (Applause.) Hard work is joyful work. (Applause.)
And make no mistake, we will win. (Applause.) We will win. We will win. We will win. We will win. (Applause.)
And one of the reasons we will win is because I do believe when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. (Applause.)
And we have an opportunity, in this election, to finally turn the page on a decade of politics that have been driven by fear and division. We're done with that. We're done. (Applause.) And we're exhausted with it. America is ready for a fresh start —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you, Kamala!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I love you, sweetheart. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
And America is ready for a new way forward where we see our fellow American not as an enemy but as a neighbor. (Applause.) We are ready — we are ready for a president who understands that the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down; it is based on who you lift up. (Applause.)
And, Pennsylvania, you know me. I am not afraid of tough fights, evidently. (Laughs.) For decades as a prosecutor and the top law enforcement officer of our biggest state, I won fights against the big banks that ripped off homeowners. I won fights against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students. I won fights against predators who abused women and children and seniors and cartels that trafficked in guns and drugs and human beings.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We're not going back! (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. And it is my pledge to you — it is my pledge to you, if you give me a chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way. (Applause.) Nothing in the world.
And it is my pledge to you that when I walk — with your help, it is my pledge to you that when I walk in the White House, instead of stewing over an enemies list, I will spend every day working on my to-do list — (applause) — on your behalf, full of priorities that are about improving your life, about bringing down the cost of living, about banning corporate price gouging on groceries, about making housing and childcare more affordable. (Applause.)
My plan will be about cutting taxes for workers and middle-class families and small businesses; lowering health care costs, including the cost of home care for our seniors. (Applause.)
Because here's wh- — here's where I'm coming from on this: I believe access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. (Applause.)
And to those certain individuals who still want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act —
AUDIENCE: Booo —
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — trying to take us back to the days when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions, well, to them, we say: We are —
AUDIENCE: Not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — not going back. We are not going back. And we are not going back —
AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We're not going back.
And we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future. (Applause.) Ours is a fight for the future. And it is a fight for freedom — (applause) — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)
And when Congress, with Bob Casey's help, passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide — (applause) — as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.)
So, Pennsylvania, I am here to ask for your vote. I am here to ask for your vote. (Applause.)
And here is my pledge — and here is my pledge to you. As president, I pledge to seek common ground and commonsense solutions to the challenges you face. (Applause.) I am not looking — I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. (Applause.)
And I pledge to you —
(A protestor disruption can be heard.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's okay.
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And — and it is my pledge to you to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make, to listen to experts, and to listen to people who disagree with me because I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy. (Applause.)
And you know what? By the way, listen, we are fighting for a democracy right now. (Applause.) And we love our democracy. And democracy can be a bit complicated sometimes, but that's okay. We are fighting for a democracy, which is why I say that I am not going to be a leader who thinks that people who disagree with me should be put in jail, that they are the enemy. (Applause.) I'll give them a seat at the table, because that's what real leaders do and that's what strong leaders do. (Applause.)
And it is my pledge to you to always put country above party and self and to be a president for all Americans. (Applause.)
So, Allentown, that is my pledge to you.
And so, let me ask: Who here has a plan to vote? (Applause.) Fantastic. That's great. That's great. (Laughs.)
All right. So, poll- — polls are open here in Pennsylvania tomorrow from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Let's get the word out. (Applause.) Let — let's get —
AUDIENCE: Vote! Vote! Vote!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Definitely vote. (Laughs.)
AUDIENCE: Vote! Vote! Vote!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Vote.
And let's get the word out. All the leaders here, help get the word out to remind people of the hours the polls are open and to remind folks that they can go to IWillVote.com for all the information that folks may need in terms of when and where to vote and where to drop off their mail ballots — right? — because that's going to be very important.
And to all the leaders here, I ask you to please continue to talk to your friends and your family and your neighbors and let them know why you decided to take time out of your busy lives to be here right now and what is at stake in this election. (Applause.) Please share your perspective on why this election is so important. And encourage folks to let them know their voices must be heard, because we —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: UAW is in the house!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And UAW is in the house. (Laughs.) (Applause.) And I am so proud to have your support. Thank you. I am so proud to have your support.
And we need everyone in Pennsylvania to vote because you are going to make the difference in this election. (Applause.) You will.
So, here's how I think about things. We are all here together because we love our country. And when you love something, you fight for it. (Applause.) And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism, of our expression of our love for our country, to then fight for its ideals and to fight to realize the promise of America.
And, look, I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it. I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights Movement. (Applause.) My parents would take me to marches when I was in a stroller. And there were people there — we've all read and know about it — there were people there from all walks of life who came together in a fight for freedom and for opportunity.
You know, growing up, I watched my mother as she raised my sister and me and gave us the same chances our country gave her. I was blessed to have family by blood and to have family by love who — (applause) — who instilled in me the values of community and compassion and faith. I've spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out but who never stopped believing in — that in our country, anything is possible. (Applause.)
I have lived the promise of America. And today, I see the promise of America in everyone who is here, in every one of you, in every one of us. We are the promise of America. (Applause.) We — everyone here, we are the promise of America. We are the promise of America.
And I see it — I see it in the fathers and the mothers and the grandparents who work hard every day for their children's future. I see it in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom. (Applause.) I see it in the men who support them. (Applause.) I see you.
I see it in the Republicans who never voted for a Democrat before but put the Constitution of the United States over party. (Applause.)
And every day, I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time. (Applause.) I do. I do. I — I love Gen Z. (Laughs.) Exactly. Right? Come on. Exactly. (Laughs.) That's right. I'm telling you, I love Gen Z. And here's one of the reasons why. (Applause.) (Laughs.) So, here's one of the things about y'all: You are rightly impatient for change. (Applause.) I know that. I know that.
And you who have only known the climate crisis are leading the charge to protect our planet and our future. You who grew up with active shooter drills are fighting to keep our schools safe. (Applause.) You who have known — you who have known fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers are standing up for freedom.
And for you, none of these issues is theoretical or political. This is your lived experience. And I see you, and I see your power. And we must, must, must recognize how bright the future of our nation is because of you.
So, can we hear it for our first-time voters, everybody? (Applause.) There we go. There we go. There we go. (Laughs.) There we go. There we go.
All right. Okay. One day left. One day left. And we need to finish this strong and get this done. So, let's get out the vote. (Applause.) Let's reach out to all of our folks in the next 24 hours: family and friends and classmates and neighbors and coworkers.
And as we do, I ask: Let us please be intentional about building community. (Applause.) Let us be intentional about building coalitions. (Applause.) Because, you know, there has been so much about these last few years that has been about trying to beat people down, trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other, trying to make people feel as though they're alone and don't have anybody. So —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Not anymore!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — not anymore, because we all know — (applause) — we all know that our power includes, yes, this vote in this election but building community and coalitions and reminding folks the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And we are all in this together. (Applause.) We are all in this together.
And from the very start of our campaign, this has not been about a fight that is against something. This is about a fight that is for something. (Applause.) This is for something. This is about a future with freedom and opportunity and dignity for all Americans.
And so, in this final stretch, let us remember that we have a lot of work to do, and there is power in our work about reminding folks of their voice and the power of their vote.
So, remember: Your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power — (applause) — is your power.
So, Pennsylvania, Allentown, I then ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)
Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.)
Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)
Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)
And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)
And when we fight —
AUDIENCE: We win!
THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.
God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hey, Allentown! Hi, everybody. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Hi. Hi. Hi. (Applause.) Hey, everyone. Hi.
Oh, it's so good to see everybody. Thank you all. Thank you. (Applause.)
Are we ready to do this? (Applause.)
Are we ready to vote? (Applause.)
Are we ready to win? (Applause.)
All right. Well, we're going to get to work. We are going to get to work. We've got 24 hours to go. (Applause.) And, Allentown, you are going to make the difference. The path to the White House runs through this room right here. (Applause.)
And — and sincerely, I want to thank everyone for taking the time out of your lives to be here — (applause) — and all the work that you have been doing, the work we will continue to do. I'm going to say it in that room, but I needed to come here and say to you all here. (Applause.)
Over these next 24 hours, I say to all the leaders who are here, let's get out there. Let's remind people of the power that they have through their vote. (Applause.) Their vote is their voice about the future of our country, because we are fighting to move forward. (Applause.)
We love our country, and we are going to see this through. And in the process, we are going to build community, and we are going to build coalitions. (Applause.) And we are going to remind each other we are all in this together. (Applause.)
And I thank you all so, so very much. Please take care. I'll see you on the other side of it all. All right? (Applause.) Thank you.
God bless you. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)
